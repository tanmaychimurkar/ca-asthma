Has anyone not been taken seriously when you come into Urgent Care or the ER?,25,0.94,13,"(#1)Have your primary care physician write you an asthma care plan letter outlining steps they would like for an UC or ER to take if you present. The cumulative adverse effects of prednisone are crazy. glad they have moved on to maintenance ICS.(#2)Former ER nurse here, and asthmatic. Unfortunately, your story is all too common. One issue is, asthma is considered a chronic condition. That causes some, maybe many providers, to not take it seriously for the patient. There are symptoms and signs. Symptoms are what the patient feels, and is subjective. Signs are what the provider can measure, such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, etc. Diagnostic tests such as lung fubtiin, xrays.

For the asthma patient to get needed treatment, your symptoms need to be expressed in terms to get their attention, particularly if the signs, don't support any real difficulty. If an asthmatic just needs an inhaler refill, unless you need acute asthma intervention, you may be ignored and sent back to your doctor  

Urgent cares are often staffed by rotating general practitioners, and are woefully inadequate. so symptoms that would communicate a medical need, are things like:

It hurts to breathe
I feel short of breath
My chest feels tight
I can't breathe deep without coughing
I can't take a deep breath

Now, if these complaints, these symptoms, don't match up to the signs the doctor csn measure, and/or diagnostic criteria don't support it, you may not be taken seriously.(#3)I‚Äôve read in numerous articles asthma attacks usually don‚Äôt affect pulse ox negatively. 

Let‚Äôs see what happens when I finally get the gumption to see a PA or MD about my (usually mild) asthma and see if I get blown off. Every time I have been into one for other stuff I beg for an rx for an inhaler and they forget.

So I slam caffeine and hope for the best. üôÑ(#4)I am incredibly lucky that my pulmonologist keeps me in nebulizers, steroids and antibiotics so I don't have to go to the ER. 

I think asthma is very complicated and if you don't go into an ER presenting exactly how they expect (which most of us don't) you don't get taken seriously.(#5)dang i guess ive been lucky, never had an issue at urgent care or er. I always get taken back either right away or within minutes even if they are packed.  the only one off has been during covid, when i went to the er almost passing out and they said per covid protocol they couldnt administer brathing treatments in the er without some special approval from someone.  that someone was taking forever so a dr came in and literally said ""F\*\*\* it order the breathing treatment now, ill deal with it later!"".  

I hope you find a provider that listens to you, i have had kaiser for years and they have been the best with my asthma issues.(#6)IME it's not just asthma, it's anything in our healthcare system.  If you want care and need care, you have to advocate aggressively for yourself.  Otherwise, you are just another task for them to get off their plate the quickest and easiest way possible.  If you think a particular treatment or medication will help you, don't hesitate to ask for it and be persistent -- if they don't want to do it, make them explain why not.

I've had asthma for well over a decade at this point.  I know my symptoms, I know my treatments, and I know what works better than anyone else does.(#7)Yeah this has happened to me quite a few times. It's disheartening to hear it's happening to other people.(#8)Do you have a peak flow meter? Bring it will you to urgent care. 

Once, I went to a pulmonologist and he told me I had anxiety and he would give me this handy device that would reassure me. He whipped out a peak flow meter and told me to breathe as hard as possible. My lungs had the output of a 5 yo maybe (150 cc vs 475 normal) and I was immediately transferred to the ER. 

I‚Äôve misplaced my peak flow meter and I‚Äôve been sick for a week now, finally went to urgent care. Got pretty much the usual ‚Äúyou sound fine‚Äù and my pulse ox was ok but they did prescribe antibiotics and steroids.(#9)It's not just you.  I went completely undiagnosed for 5 years (of my noticing the symptoms) and saw 3 different doctors about it. I was told 'there are tests, but I don't think we need to put you through that. Just monitor how you're feeling and let me know if it get's worse.""  For 5 years I was the worst hiking partner because I had to stop every 10 minutes and sit down because I was getting tunnel vision and almost passing out. I'd wake up coughing every night and basically didnt' sleep for 5 years. Every time I laughed I coughed for several minutes and had to sit quietly while I wheezed and tried not to pass out.  FINALLY i saw a doctor who immediately said it sounded like asthma and prescribed me a steriod inhaler. Within 24 hours I could fucking breathe!  It's been a few months now since I started the steriod inhaler and I sleep through almost every night, I can watch comedies and laugh, I shovel snow like a madman. It feels like I have my life back. I cannot wait to see how hiking is now.  Luckily, I haven't ever had to go to the ER, I""m always able to find air if I sit still and quiet and concentrate on slow, easy breaths for however long it takes. I was probably just niave but it pisses me off when I think about how long I tried to get help and how many Doctors that I had to beg to pay attention.(#10)Bruhhhhhhhhhhhh i literally hate the Word ANXIETYYYYYYYYY . Every fucking ignorant fuck  in the health care system uses that Excuse!
i had it happen multiple times to me , those Fuckers they actually wanna see u literally dying in front of them to take u seriously , fucking scums(#11)well, when I fractured my wrist I had to wait 6 or 7 hours just to get it xrayed at an urgent care clinic. like I know that there is a waiting list and everything but like broken bone.. potentially??"
Any tips on getting a toddler to take a steroid?,7,1.0,25,"(#1)It sucks but often we just have to hold my toddler down and force the liquid down his throat (kinda squirt it into his cheek and blow on his face until he swallows). I don't think it's necessarily traumatic though. He hates it and screams and cries but honestly it just needs to be done so the quicker you get it over with, the less drama there needs to be about it.(#2)I know how bad Prednisone tastes, uch. My parents trained me to take pills by having me swallow a few mini m&ms whole with water, and then I'd get the whole rest of the tube to eat regularly.  Maybe begin with that.

If he already usually takes pills well, you could also get a flavorless gelcap like [these from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08S78CXNB/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_1KRKQ0SFD9HSW2ZWDFBN?psc=1) and put the pill in there so it doesn't have a taste going down.

Edit: [Here's a link to a multi pack of different sizes to try out.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085MMZR7V/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_0P3VZ4PHZSWTFQ664G1J) the one I linked above is the smallest available, but may not fit the medication.(#3)I do the liquid mixed with chocolate syrup and then followed by more chocolate syrup(#4)I got different synringes. I had pred and the rest clear juice.  That way she didn't know when the pred was coming. I cleaned the end of the pred one and dipped it in juice too. It helped but we still had rough times too.

Edit: op if you choose to use pills. Please at least familiarize yourself with [the heimlich.](https://nortonchildrens.com/news/heimlich-maneuver-abdominal-thrust-choking/)(#5)How old is he? Do you think he would be able to start learning how to swallow pills? My Nana taught me how to with a small piece of toast when I was three and I took pills from there on out. Only if you and his doctors think he‚Äôs competent enough of course.(#6)make sure youre using an evaporative humidifier and not one of those ""cool mist/warm mist/sonic"" ones. those ones nebulize all the minerals in your water into the air and aggravate airways.(#7)I had to take steroids for a while growing up for reasons other than asthma, my mother and her adoptive mother would chase it with a spoon full of sugar or syrup, they used to even sing the whole ‚Äúa spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down, in the most delightful way‚Äù and it was a pretty good distraction. Also kept me from spitting it out right away. My dad on the other hand told me about the pill fairy who‚Äôs gives candy to children who take their medicine and reports back to Santa year round.(#8)try applesauce, that always worked for me as a kid(#9)This is completely off topic, and you didn‚Äôt ask, but my suggestion is to cut out all dairy for at least one week to see if there‚Äôs any improvement. As someone who has struggled life-long with breathing issues, this could help. All the best.(#10)Could they try a different steroid or find a flavoring that makes it more palatable? Orapred ODT is prednisolone so relatively similar and may make it easier. It would be an orally disintegrating tablet so melts relatively quickly. It‚Äôs only slightly different in the chemistry but should be ok.(#11)I suck at swallowing pills. Part of the reason is I am afraid I'm gonna choke or they won't go down right away. The fear of it not going down right away is from taking prednisone at an early age. They are nasty pills and leave a bitter, disgusting taste in your mouth. It's even worse because they start to dissolve immediately when they come in contact with saliva or water. 

As an adult, in order to take my prednisone pills, I use a slice of soft bread. I sit the pill on top of the bread and tear the bread and form a little bread ball around the pill. I press it tight so it encapsulates the pill into a little bread ball. I then swallow the bread ball. The bread insulates the pill so it doesn't start dissolving right away and gives me time to swallow it. Prolly a little juvenile, but it works. 

When my dog won't take her pills, I coat them in peanut butter and she suddenly wolfs them down. Similar concept with me and the bread I guess. When I had Littles I had to hold em down and get it in until everyone was crying, me included. Sometimes bribery is also the staples easy button.(#12)Maybe try rolling it up in a little bit of bread and having him swallow it? It'll mask the bitter taste and if you press it into a ball it'll be smoother than a pill which might have pointy edges. My mom did this for me when I was little and it worked."
FDA Approves First Generic of Symbicort to Treat Asthma and COPD,88,1.0,23,"(#1)Last time I tried to get a prescription for the generic, I was told that my insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover it. And that Symbicort was a ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù drug (guess they have some deal worked out). 

Is it worth trying to get the generic now that it‚Äôs been approved?(#2)Symbicort has had a generic for awhile now. I'm guessing this is a different generic that insurance probably will not cover.(#3)Sometimes my body doesn‚Äôt like generics but I REALLY hope this one does it for me!(#4)I don‚Äôt understand this? I‚Äôve been on the generic of Symbicort for a year now? How is this news or a new approval?(#5)What does this mean for asthmatics? Cheaper inhalers?(#6)There should be a law against insurance banning  generics- like seriously what‚Äôs the point of insurance if they won‚Äôt cover the bases like this(#7)That shit made me insane, looked online, known side effect....like LITERALLY turned me into a suicidal maniac.

Be careful(#8)Maybe FDA approval will make it harder for them to refuse to carry the generic? I am in United and they currently refuse to provide the generic and charge me minimum $40 an inhaler on the most premium insurance.(#9)That‚Äôs awesome!"
working on controlling asthma. getting higher peak flow when feeling tight chested?,1,1.0,0,
"So I had really bad asthma as a kid, but haven‚Äôt dealt with asthma since highschool. Last few years I‚Äôve been dealing with what I thought was anxiety, I‚Äôd get light headed, chest pains, headaches. I‚Äôve noticed around this time of the year it‚Äôs worst as my allergies kick up",7,1.0,3,"(#1)Your health is not singular. Its normal for one part of your health to be affected by another. Anxiety and asthma and allergies have overlapping symptoms which can make it difficult to detangle and make sense of.(#2)Do you take allergy meds?

Have you seen a therapist for anxiety?(#3)This is exactly what happened to me. 

I had asthma when I was younger but nothing severe other than as needed medication. It totally disappeared during high school and the years following after until I was around 25. Then it came back and I felt like my chest was always heavy.. my PCP said it was anxiety but I knew deep down it wasn't. I booked an appointment with an asthma doctor and after a MCC and a few breathing tests they told me my asthma was pretty reactive to allergens/the environment. Now I'm on a controller medicine and that weight is off my chest."
im 18 and have asthma and just tested positive for covid has anyone any comfort stories to help me relax a little,10,0.86,25,"(#1)I have asthma and had covid. Covid didn't make my asthma worse at all. I actually used my inhaler less.(#2)I‚Äôm 22, I have uncontrolled asthma and have had covid twice. My breathing was unaffected by it.(#3)Had covid January 2021, 44F with asthma. No issues at all. Felt like a really bad cold with aches and pains, but no  lung issues. I take the proventative Flovent 220 for the last several years though and my asthma is pretty controlled(#4)I have asthma and caught covid a little over a year ago and I was fine after 2 days. Just a headache and some fatigue.(#5)Most Asthma treatments are also COVID treatments and assuming you have the vaccine you should be fine.(#6)I had COVID and my asthma got worse BUT here is what should comfort you: my asthma was going untreated at the time, i didn‚Äôt have maintenance or steroid inhalers to reduce the inflammation. Afterwards my pulmonologist confirmed that my so-called exercise induced asthma was just regular asthma so I was finally given treatment. If you feel any chest pain at ALL please go to the emergency room. I had to and they were able to help me alleviate those symptoms eventually. Also, the thing that hurt me the most was that I got long-haul COVID, which is quite rare and most who get COVID have mild symptoms. My pulmonologist had a theory that this was all worse for me because my lung functioning prior to getting sick was very low since my asthma had, again, been untreated and unconfirmed. So I think you should be in good shape since you are aware of your asthma, likely have a treatment plan for it, and have the doctors who diagnosed you with it on standby. Good luck, I promise you‚Äôll get through before you know it. Take good care of yourself, plenty of fluids, take decongestants as recommended, and get some sleep. I am 18 and was when I had it back in September, and I was told to focus on getting better over schoolwork. Your health is the most important thing in the end and professors (if you‚Äôre in college), teachers, or employers are usually understanding and lenient for this stuff.(#7)25 yrs old Covid didn‚Äôt affect my breathing at all, just was super tired and had a headache for like two days. You should be fine(#8)I had Covid-19 in early January. I'm vaccinated and boosted. I had headache, sore throat, and fatigue. My asthma was fine. I've recovered completely.(#9)Theres this one dude i actually read with moderate - severe asthma they had covid their asthma was perfectly fine . just needed their inhaler for some chest congestion , no hospital needed(#10)Only fever for a day. No impact on breathing(#11)My sister and I both have asthma, she's had covid twice unvaccinated and I have had it last week ( vaccinated). Didn't affect our breathing.(#12)late 20‚Äôs, moderate asthma (on maintenance ICS) had covid twice after being double vaxxed and had no significant breathing changes. first time i had it i monitored oxygen with pulse ox the whole time and i never went below 97% or so despite getting pretty moderate symptoms. would definitely recommend getting vaccinated if you haven‚Äôt. not only does it make sense for your bodily health, but it also helped with my asthma/health anxiety knowing that chances for adverse covid effects were greatly reduced because of it. 

got a cold this week after going to a concert that seems to have developed into a chest infection and have had much more significant breathing changes from this than either time with covid.(#13)Im sure i read on the list of health conditions and how dangerous covid is if you have them, asthma didnt even make the top 20. 
I trust youll be ok! Make sure to speak to your doctor to see if theres any relief they can offer incase!
All the best to you(#14)You‚Äôre young, if you aren‚Äôt obese you will beat this easily. The whole ‚ÄúCOVID is more dangerous for those with Asthma‚Äù narrative is not really anything to be worried about, especially for someone as young as you. Just give it time.

So I think I almost died in my sleep‚Ä¶,11,0.87,9,"(#1)After my second C section they made me take some nasty opioid and I woke up gasping for air in the night like hardcore! I felt like I was suffocating. I got rid of the stupid drug after. I used ibuprofen and acetaminophen only. I‚Äôd rather be in pain and be able to breathe. I feel you, OP.(#2)Call your doc asap about the Seroquel. Two of the severe side effects of Seroquel are fainting and difficulty breathing.(#3)so my fiance‚Äôs medical history sounds pretty similar to urs. both the physical health and the mental health things. he is just a few years younger (19M as of yesterday lol)

anyway... he is prescribed 100mg Seroquel (i think that‚Äôs the dosage) to take at night for sleep. we‚Äôve been living together for about 6 months now. he has taken it every night for the majority of time we‚Äôve been together (there was about a month or two ish where we couldnt get/afford a refill).

anywayyyyy.. i HATE when he takes his Seroquel. he acts like he is F*CKED up when he takes it. like f*cked up on bars or rlly any benzo or even opioid. he just starts nodding out and talking about random bullsh*t and slurring his speech and being hella confused and being completely unaware of what he is doing and even getting a little aggressive sometimes. additionally... sometimes it makes his breathing in his sleep Really weird. it‚Äôll be like inconsistent and sound quite struggled??? 

im sorry your S.O. had to slap the f*ck out of u to wake u up. (i know i should not have) but i chucked when i read that part bc i can relate too much. i feel so bad every time it happens but i have to slap the SH*T out of my partner to wake him up when he takes his Seroquel. one time that still wasnt working and i was starting to panic so i legit pushed his 200lb body (i am like 100lb tiny ass F) fully off of the edge of the bed onto the floor. that one worked LOL.

so all of that to say... your concerns about the Seroquel are entirely reasonable. my partner hates when i offer my opinions on it bc im ‚Äúnot a doctor‚Äù which.. true. however, now *i* am the one who is not sleeping at night bc i feel like i have to monitor him at all times when he takes the seroquel. 

be safe and take care of urself dude! best of luck(#4)no drugs

lose weight

change your diet

exercise

i did(#5)That stuff on low doses (50mg) hits like a truck from what I remember. I think it has more of an antihistamine effect. Glad you had help in those moments.(#6)Sounds like sleep apnea bro I have it with the asthma. Lose weight and don‚Äôt smoke or drinks alcohol ‚Ä¶"
"just trying to figure out a new issue i have, do any of u get asthma symptoms if u strain to go to the bathroom or",3,0.8,1,(#1)actually i experienced this as well . during a flare up its no fun at all . does your stomach / chest hurt more as well ?
Can not function- Severe Persistent Asthma,4,1.0,21,"(#1)Taking Symbicort once a day is not going to help you. The box should say 2 puffs twice a day. It is not a 24 hour controller med.

Are you seeing a therapist for your anxiety? Anxiety can heavily mimic asthma symptoms and it's not uncommon to suffer extreme anxiety as graduation approaches.(#2)See your campus Disability Services office. You should be able to get accommodations for your asthma. 

Also see an immunologist to rule out some other sort of autoimmune issue.(#3)Hi. Asthma is a serious disease. It can only be managed via good long-term outpatient care. If your symbicort is not working for you you may need to find a different raven several different inhalers. 

You say you didn‚Äôt realize how bad asthma could be but you should know right now that it can it does kill lots of people. Please either educate yourself or have your doctor educate you on the dangers of asthma, how do use your reliever inhaler and when to go to the hospital or call 911. 

As for your issues with school, get in touch directly with the administration. You may be able to retake the test because you were sick or you may need to take time off.(#4)I may get down voted but so be it.

I was on Singulair for 3 years with no issues... I thought.

I wrote off escalating anxiety (like freaky weird not normal anxiety) and suicidal ideation (like a drumbeat hundreds of times a day) to general but treated mental health issues.

I had no idea there was a black box warning. I wasn't looking but stumbled upon an article.

My internist had expressed previously he didn't think it was helping but I was afraid to go off.

Fast forward. Quit Singulair. No fear of driving, people breaking in,  kid dying,  violence and suicidal thoughts stopped almost immediately.

So if your doc thinks you are safe going off of it for awhile you might consider it. MOST people have no issues but there is a warning for a reason.

And I second symbicort is twice a day.

I also bought a nebulizer. I can't do albuterol but I do saline and it thins the gunk in my chest and the moisture helps as well.

Hang in there!(#5)Do u have GERD or stomach problems? Or LPR? Those can make breathlessness so much worse. I was also on symbicort for very long, singular too, nothing ever helped. Went off symbicort, saw no difference. Only thing that helped is breathing techniques and most importantly different diet. No more spicy food, small portions, adding turmeric powder to diet. Avoiding deep fried food, vegetable oils. Anti anxiety meds helped too. How did ur spirometry turn out? What was ur fev1?

Ur story sounds very familiar to mine in all honesty, I thought I have severe persistent asthma, but the truth is I might not even have asthma at all. I was being diagnosed at a hospital for 2 weeks, they sent me home with inhalers and singulair and told me it may take time for them to work. Ive waited for months and couldnt cope. They diagnosed me with asthma because of signs of chronic inflammation in the bronchis. I visited another pulmonologist and he said I might not even have asthma at all! Its all so mad how doctors can be so wrong, even when you are at a hospital. I suggest u look a different route than asthma if medication isnt helping at all, stomach issues can cause false dyspnea that causes very often chronic breathlessness that can be mistaken for asthma or exist alongside it and make it so much worse. I was suicidal.(#6)Hi this story is very similar to mine!! Extreme asthma flare up for past 6 months or so‚Ä¶here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm taking 
Symbicort 2x morning 
Spiriva 2x in the morning
Singular evening 
Symbicort 2x at night‚Ä¶.ventolin as needed‚Ä¶also have a nebulizer which helps a lot more, I use it when the wheezing it‚Äôs really bad and chest feels tight‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm also on immunotherapy, xolair shots biweekly because my doc thinks my asthma is from severe allergies, they found high IGE in my blood. If you have insurance please ask your doctor about it

is Qvar a good controller inhaler,3,0.67,6,"(#1)It is if it works for you. It works for some people. Some inhalers don't work well for some people, some do. You really don't know until you give it a shot, everybody's pretty different. But there's nothing inherently wrong with Qvar in general. If it works for you then yes, it's good.(#2)Qvar is the only maintenance inhaler that even works for me. I‚Äôve not had good experience with others. It‚Äôs more mild and fewer side effects.(#3)I loved Qvar it was a go to add on inhaler until my insurance stopped coving it. Qvar uses a steroid with a smaller particle size than other inhalers, so it has an easier time getting into the small airway.(#4)I have been prescribed it twice a day when mine flares up and once a day for maintenance. When I take it twice a day, I sometimes end up more moody. I also get moody/ mood swings when I take prednisone as well. And several people in my family who have taken prednisone get that reaction as well so it may be a genetic predisposition to steroids. But that is my only problem with it. Not noticeable with once a day for me!"
Asthma got really worse... Any idea why?,16,1.0,24,"(#1)Likely seasonal allergies as we're approaching spring. That's often the case with my asthma. I live in what is locally called ""sinus valley"" (allergies hit everyone hard, there's a lot of air pollution, and it's a valley in an area with like no wind so stuff just lingers in the air). My allergies start to flare up my asthma symptoms around Mar/Apr, get really bad between May-June (when stuff is in full bloom here), subside a bit until they ramp up again around Sept-Oct (ragweed). All that really helps aside from my regular asthma meds with the allergies is Xyzal and Flonase (generics of both of those) - those are OTC medications so maybe worth asking your dr about or just trying to see if they help in the meantime.(#2)Mould? Pollen? Neighbor in apartment building smoking inside and/or outside?(#3)Look for other sources of dust- maybe your furnace filters need changing? Recently, i got a bad flare after wearing a robe that I hadn‚Äôt worn in awhile and it was really dusty without me realizing it. You might also be allergic to pollen or other seasonal stuff. I was asthma free for like 10 years and then it came back one spring.(#4)You mentioned moving into your first apartment and being allergic to cats. Could the previous tenants have had cats? Dander takes months-years to break down, so the fact that there isn't a cat there now doesn't mean it's not a cat reaction.(#5)Ah‚Ä¶ welcome to the seasonal allergies and the mystery of shared space allergies. Apartments‚Ä¶ yay‚Ä¶. 

Shared air, allergens in hallways, etc.

I used to sleep in the college dorm with the window open. In a polar sleeping bag. When the outside temperature was below 0.

Not in the US so don't know about your meds, but that might be a useful step.(#8)I moved into a new apartment and my asthma started flaring up like this.  I've only ever used rescue inhalers, so I can't compare on that but my solution was to get an air purifier next to my bed and run it almost non stop.  I've found that Allegra helps mitigate my symptoms for allergy related asthma attacks too, if that helps.(#9)Happens to me too, it's scary at times(#10)üíú¬†it"
Asthma returned after 4 years medication advice.,5,1.0,6,"(#1)I really encourage you to ask your doctor about a referral to an allergy and asthma specialist. If you are planning on keeping your cat, you might consider allergy testing to be sure your resurgence of wheezing is not caused by the cat. Your flare-up may be caused by something else in your environment, if it isn‚Äôt the cat. It is a challenge sometimes to pinpoint the cause."

Make sure you are tested for allergies. If you have allergies see if you can start on immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has helped me go from being allergic to about 30 things down to about 10. The allergy meds and immunotherapy take awhile to work so be patient. Know you are not alone. Buy a pulse oximetry and spirometer and keep a check on your lung function if you need peace of mind."

Windpipe / Larynx / Trachea Discomfort,5,1.0,5,(#1)You should do some research about Vocal Cord Dysfunction. It mimics many of the symptoms of asthma. It would require an ENT to diagnose and can be treated with speech therapy exercises to retrain the vocal cords to reduce or eliminate the dysfunction. You can also search YouTube for videos on the exercises and give them a try.
Reason for asthma exacerbation?,2,1.0,6,"(#1)If your asthma's been more pronounced, your doctor might need to adjust the dosage of your controller med and/or add something like Singulair on top of it. Generally needing your rescue inhaler 2x/week or more is a sign that your controller meds need to be adjusted. Viruses are a big asthma trigger, and it sometimes takes a long time after an infection to bounce back to more of a normal state. 

If your asthma is allergic, you might benefit from allergy testing to figure out what exactly is exacerbating it (pollens? pets? dust? a detergent?) so you can focus more heavily on avoiding those triggers. For dust, you'll want allergen-reducing pillowcases and/or a mattress enclosure, and to wash your bedding with hot water on a weekly basis to kill the dust mites. You mention a weekly deep clean - I personally find that many common cleaners (especially bleach) aggravate my asthma. If you can have your partner do that part of the cleaning so you can avoid the fumes, it may help. You should also wear a high-filtration mask (think a KN95) while cleaning to keep from breathing in any dust you're stirring up. And make sure to dust with a damp cloth rather than a dry cloth, because a dry cloth will put that dust right back in the air.

For pollen, make sure you're bathing the dog more frequently, and that you're showering before bedtime and washing your hair so you're not transferring pollen from your body to the bed and rolling around in it all night.

For a mild pet allergy, you should keep your bedroom as a pet-free space and make sure your pajamas stay in that room (again so you aren't transferring dander from your clothes into the bed).

You may also consider changing the filters in your ventilation system regardless of the trigger.(#2)It can be really helpful to brush the dog out on a daily basis and bathe weekly. Dogs will bring a ton of pollen in to the house since they love to roll around in grass.

Brush the cat on a daily basis and wipe the cat down with a damp washcloth once/twice a week to get rid of any pollen/dust in her hair.

Ignore the people who are immediately going to say get rid of your loved pets."
Does anyones dr allow them to just use rescue inhaler not preventative?,26,0.96,85,"(#1)The sad reality is that preventative steroids (especially the duo inhalers) are outrageously overpriced. My Symbicort costed me 300$ this month because my deductible reset. :((#2)If you are using albuterol more than 2-3 times a week, it means your asthma is not in control and that inflammation is continually damaging your lungs. The longer you put off going on a controller med, your lungs are getting more and more damaged.(#3)As the side effect of frequent albuterol use is increased mortality, most clinicians here would never allow it as placebo was found to be safer than that level of frequency in recent trials due to the effects of downregulation by SABA. Can't stop patients from not using their medications but would anyone openly advise that as a regimen knowing what we know now. No.(#4)Hi. That‚Äôs because in the past few years that we have compiled mountains of evidence that not using a preventative inhaler puts the patients at a markedly increased risk for death or injury from an asthma attack. Even if for people whose symptoms are normally mild. 

Your doctor is trying to prescribe the treatment regimen that meets the most current guidelines. It‚Äôs not just to protect you from death it‚Äôs also because he has a professional obligation to follow the scientific recommendations when making treatment plans.(#5)Albuterol is not a maintenance drug and should not be used as one. Honestly it‚Äôs not the safest drug in the world especially when overused. If you using your inhaler more than 2-3 times a week your asthma is not under control.(#6)What side effects were you feeling? Some of the oral steroids are available at lower dosages.(#7)You could maybe check out your pillow and blankets, windows,and vents (if any) if you‚Äôre only having the issue right as you‚Äôre sleeping. Maybe it‚Äôs allergy related?(#8)THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME TO TAKE MY INHALER(#9)I am in the same boat, nighttime wheezing prevented with a puff of albuterol. A puff of albuterol solved mild triggers of exercise, cold, stress, dust. Inflammation. A strong cup of coffee if I was out of albuterol. And I was often out, since doctors won't prescribe at the rates I wanted to use. 

To answer your question, you will always be struggling to get albuterol for daily use. As soon as you find a doctor who goes along with the idea, they will retire or something and you're back to one a year max.

I fought steroid solutions for 30 years for various reasons. Long term bone health was one of them. Price was another. 

Long-term health is a good consideration. I might have good bones, but those lungs? I was never dragged to the hospital in an ambulance for nighttime wheezing that albuterol wouldn't fix until I was in my 50s. 

So I ended up on Symbicort after the second hospitalization.  Insurance keeps it affordable now, for me. It's a pretty good solution. I feel much better, consistently, day after day.

If you can afford it, I recommend trying Symbicort.(#10)not taking a steroid inhaler means youre allowing inflammation to continue in your airways long-term which is causing scar tissue to form. youre gonna end up causing yourself alot more breathing issues in the future that wont be reversible like it is now. albuterol doesnt reduce inflammation, it just relaxes muscle tissue.(#11)I‚Äôve never heard of using albuterol daily like a maintenance inhaler. Some of my family members only use albuterol do. But not on the daily basis. Some of them only have really mild exercise induced or viral-induced asthma. That means they have a rescue inhaler but don‚Äôt use it unless it‚Äôs necessary. Like once every couple years when they catch a cold or something. Where I live inhalers are quite cheap, but they still say that if you need to use the rescue inhaler more then 2-3 times a week you need to get a proper maintenance inhaler. So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs about the money. At least not here.

Edit: and there are many different maintenance inhalers. So maybe just tell the doctor which ones didn‚Äôt work, and they gonna give you a different one.(#12)Your doctor camt make you use a steroid inhaler, you dont have to pick up that perscription even if its called in. If he wants to require a steroid inhaler to perscribe albuterol just go along with it and never fill the script. If they ask just say you forgot because you never needed it.(#13)A tip I got from this subreddit and helped my partner hugely is to take Mucinex at night. My partner used to take his rescue every night as well and hates the preventative inhalers. He doesn't even sound mucus-y but its worked wonders. Maybe give that a try??(#14)You may have had side effects from the inhalers you have tried so far, but you may not with others. As a chronic migraine sufferer, I certainly understand why you wouldn't want to take medication that triggered them; it's totally fine to say 'no' to a certain medication because the side effects are intolerable to you. With my own experience of a medication merry-go-round with my migraines, I'm always telling other people, if your medication doesn't agree with you, by all means, it's reasonable to decide it's not for you, but *you should go back to your doctor and discuss other options.*

There are lots of different types of steroids and inhalers, and people respond differently to different ones. so it is very likely there would be a different inhaler that would suit you better, either one with a different steroid, or steroid/LABA combination. Your position would be more reasonable if you'd exhausted everything, but you haven't. So  please talk to your doctor about the many options you haven't tried yet; it may take some patience but with some trial and error you will hopefully find something that works and gives you minimal/no side effects.(#15)I could have written this , exactly me ‚Ä¶. Just I don‚Äôt use it nightly as I ‚Äúpush‚Äù a bit before take the rescue . Symbicort made me cough quite a bit  . I suffered it for a few months and went back to my old inhaler routine and content with it . Thx for posting as I was curious to this .(#16)If you have to use your rescue inhaler that often, you have inflammation and your asthma isn't controlled. It might depend on what your triggers are but you really should talk to your healthcare provider preferably one that specializes in respiratory issues. If you're talking to a GP, ask for a referral to a specialist. My respiratory therapist changed my life and worked with me to figure out a steroid plan that didn't give me nightmares and anxiety attacks.

I had pretty bad side effects on some steroids but we found one that I can tolerate at half dose for a relatively short period of time after a flare up."

I am not formally diagnosed myself, but am on 3 of the 4 commonly prescribed treatments, so I haven't pushed it further. My allergist didn't do the right test, and from what I've read, I would need to be in a flare (which is time sensitive) for it to show up in the labs.(#3)This is me. I‚Äôve become so sensitive to any smells or fragrances. I can‚Äôt be around anyone with perfume or cologne on, and I‚Äôll actively avoid freshly cleaned areas.

I do wheeze sometimes and I've also had stridor.  I run out of breath pretty easy sometimes feel like im a bit dizzy disoriented.  I've also noticed in the spring it's much worse, winter isn't too bad.  I figured there must be an allergy component to it.

Has anyone developed high eosinophils/asthma/respiratory issues from pregnancy?,2,1.0,2,"(#1)I have asthma that started during pregnancy of my 2nd child!! Mine was really bad during pregnancy, several pneumonias & a broken rib from coughing.
After having baby, asthma comes back only when I have a cold. Any virus triggers it!!
No real reason why it started at 5 weeks pregnant. They can‚Äôt figure out why,
My treatment is albuterol/breo and very rarely prednisone.
Wishing you all the best!

P.S. i have started playing tennis occasionally, going for walks and swimming when possible. Physical activity helps with my type of asthma but it‚Äôs frustrating when I start walking after an asthma episode which usually lasts a month. When i start walking after that it‚Äôs like 10 minutes because can‚Äôt do more than increase slowly as my lung capacity improves. Had a bad asthma throughout January but I build up my strength to play tennis 2 months later. 
Try any physical activity you like and build on it.(#2)I just barely did for the first time a few weeks ago.

Had mild exercise induced asthma in hight school. The level that if I went for a 4 mile run for xc practice, and if it was smoky outside, I had to use a puff of an Albuterol inhaler before my run to be able to breathe well. Easily controlled.

No asthma since then. Now, a decade later, I got covid in my 6th month of pregnancy. I got better for a couple weeks and then my husband got a sore throat from something else, and I didn't feel sick but I started wheezing. He coughed for a few weeks and got better. Here I am a month later dealing with more intense asthma than I've ever experienced. 

At first I tried Mucinex when I thought it was an acute illness, then Claritin in case it was allergies, then my doctor listened to my lungs and prescribed an Albuterol inhaler and said if that didn't work to go to an urgent care. It worked for 2 days. I woke up struggling to breathe and maxing out on my Albuterol with hardly any effect, and went to an urgent care. There I got duoneb, which helped, and have been doing duoneb and Albuterol treatments via nebulizer daily since then. When *that* wasn't enough I got put on oral steroids (Medrol) and have continued the nebulizer treatments. That has finally started to bring it down again.

My CBC also shows increased eosinophils.

I'm trying to figure out if acid reflux and/or dust in my bedroom are also exacerbating the problem, because the wheezing gets much worse at night esp if I don't sleep propped up. Wood smoke is also a trigger.

Right now I'm concerned about getting it under control before labor. I haven't even started thinking about what could happen if it continues or gets worse after delivery.

And like you, I have no idea why it started during pregnancy. Our immune systems are supposed to be more chill during pregnancy, not over-reactive!"
Help! Breathless for 4 years.,2,1.0,10,"(#1)Being overweight is going to make breathing progressively more difficult.

Have you ever tried a course of Nexium for GERD?(#2)Symptoms you are experiencing aren't related to asthma, most likely -- speaking from my own experience here. What most likely you are experiencing is a ""false dyspnea"", a phenomenon commonly found in people with gastric issues as well as anxiety. Do you yawn or sigh looking for breath but can't get one in? If so, that sounds like false dyspnea. Last year I've been diagnosed with asthma, which was incorrect and I found out I have false dyspnea caused by stomach issues and anxiety. I have made a lot of progress since I found out about this. If what I'm describing sounds familiar, you can definitely get help for this annoying breathlessness, whether it's caused by anxiety, GERD, h. pylori.(#3)Sino nasal polyps can cause issues similar to these. Mine raged for four years before a doc figured it out. Ventolin doesn‚Äôt help me much, either, but I do have asthma in addition to the polyps so sometimes it helps.

Does anyone have experience living in a trailer/ trailer park with asthma?,1,0.67,3,"(#1)Hi. Some trailer parks are really nice and some really suck. The exact environment of the trailer park and it‚Äôs smoking policies are something that you have more knowledge of them we do. 

That said, trailers universally expose its occupants to more allergens than a house, because the ventilation is so rudimentary. Also trailers pretty generally have less climate control than a house, so if heat or colder one of your triggers it will be problem.

In the future if you rent a home with carpeting, you may have a good luck steam cleaning the carpet with a anti-allergen or an anti-dust mite detergent.(#2)The housing market is absolutely insane so no judgement on that front. 
Removing carpet should help a lot, especially if you have dust mite allergies. 
The other comments about the heating/ventilation and smoking policies are a good considerations. 

Landlords don't care about things like mold so maybe getting out of an apartment is good.(#3)I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything specifically attached to trailers or trailer parks that would trigger your asthma. As with any housing, it just depends on carpeting, mold, dust, smoke, pet dander, etc."

How to help my boyfriend during wheezing attacks,14,0.95,29,"(#1)Calm calm calm‚Ä¶. Work on calm. Get him into the shower with the vent fan on. Clean humid air will help a lot.

Does he have an inhaler ? Use it.

No inhaler ? A cup of coffee will help.

Then get him out of your place. Head to a coffee shop or similar place with clear air. And once he‚Äôs better, have a long conversation about his asthma and allergies.


FWIW my wife brought a cat into our marriage. I have asthma. I‚Äôm allergic to cats. I take medicine. We‚Äôve been married for almost 40 years. We have 5 cats in our house. One little fuzzy butt loves to sleep on my chest. 

Wheezy ? Yeah. Worth it ? Yeah.

Ed: OH ! It‚Äôs not at your place and not your cat. OK ! 

Anytime anyone is in a place that makes them Ill‚Ä¶ LEAVE. Asthma is often an allergic or immune reaction to an irritant. Dusty ? Pollution? Cigarettes? Vaping ? Cats ? Dogs ? Mass Hysteria ? They can all start an attack. Get out to clear air. It will help.(#2)I'm a chronic asthmatic who is allergic to cats who ended up adopting a friend's cats. Maybe *try* to keep the bedroom cat free ü§£. Otherwise, what was suggested by the other sane poster.(#3)Taking an antihistamine such as Xyzal before going to a party with a cat should help. Benedryl might help if he‚Äôs really having a reaction. 

He really should get an inhaler from his doctor, even if he rarely needs it. 

If he has other allergies, he could see and allergist about getting allergy shots which will decrease his sensitivity to those things he is allergic to.(#4)Hey the $99 Blue air filter for your house. Cleans the air beautifully and makes every room it's in - s safe place.(#5)In my experience with partners with cats it is beneficial to come prepared. Take Antihistamines well before the visit and take my Inhaler/preventor before entering the house. 

Depending on your circumstances it may be worth doing a deep clean of the home or limiting the roaming area of the cat.(#6)Take a daily allergy medication. 

Potentially add Benadryl to the mix before he comes over. 

Have leather furniture, clean any drapes that may have cat hair on them regularly, if you have cloth furniture shampoo it and clean it. Get any carpets cleaned and vaccum before he comes over. Keep cats off the furniture he's on as much as possible. 

Hang over at his place where there are no cats.(#7)I grew up with cats but became highly allergic in my late 20's- so allergic that I can't stay longer than 10 minutes in someone's home if they have a cat or I wheeze and get itchy all over (this happens even though I am on Qvar, Singulair, and Zyrtec). I am seeing a lot of suggestions in the comments but depending on how allergic he is, removing himself from where the cats have been may be the only helpful thing. Fingers crossed that allergy meds, using an inhaler, etc. work for him! I would also add that if he goes somewhere where there are cats and then leaves, it may be helpful to shower or at least change clothes once he gets home.(#8)Get rid of your cats(#9)agree with the other comments. 

before starting xolair my husband would just sit with me quietly. that kept me calm.

I used nebulized albuterol to break the attack. Inhalers, for some reason, don't work as well for me. 

keep the air clean. Air cleaner, fan, no smoke or incense or other products to make the house smell good.

remind him to keep follow up appointments with his doctor

bring a bottle of water everywhere

bathe cats weekly

vacuum with hepa filter daily

I'm allergic to cats also and get asthma from it. 

Currently restarting allergy shots too.(#10)He should be taking antihistamines such as Zyrtec/Allegra/etc on a daily basis to control his allergies. They need to be taken on a daily basis.

In the party case, he should take a Benadryl.(#11)Get rid of the cats all of them or get a new bf.(#12)The most important thing is that you stay calm and on top of the situation. He is not able to breathe, so he might be in a panic. If he starts hyperventilating, he will feel worse, so you have to be as cool as possible. I understand that this is hard, but it helps to be prepared.

Personally, I need someone who tells me how to breathe sometimes. If he starts losing his rythm or his breath is racing, start counting or breathe ""with"" him and tell him when to breathe in and out. Take your time with every breath, don't rush it. If he tells you to shut up, do so. It might be annoying to him. Learn about breathing techniques. They do a lot and help to calm down.

Have the rescue inhaler close. If he has more than one or one which is close to empty, he might want to give one to you, so you can help out if his is lost or forgotten. Learn how they have to be used. Shake for ten second - you can be helpful here, in the midst of an attack I won't be able to - put it in his mouth - please let him do that! - press the aerosol down and count. He has to keep it in for ten seconds to work properly. If he fails to do that, make him take another puff. Learn how to use his other meds as well if he has any so you are able to assist.

If it does not help, call an ambulance if he does not have oral steroids in emergencies. If he does, let him take them, wait another thirty minutes. If there are signs of an life threatening attack, don't hesitate. If you call an ambulance once too often, people might be annoyed. If you call it one time less than necessary, someone might die. But, on a positive note, most asthma attacks are far from life threatening, so just stay calm and look for the signs, just in case.

You seem to be a great, caring girlfriend. He is happy to have you!(#13)Coffee hot asap(#14)Your boyfriend should always keep his inhaler with him. I‚Äôve learned that the hard way.

What's the difference between the preventer inhaler types?,7,1.0,12,"(#1)The others explained everything better than I could, but there ist something I want to add: there are liquids and powder inhalers. The powder seems to be a bit better to get everything into your lungs, but please don't ask me why this is the case. My doctor seems to prefer them.

If you use a spray, you might benefit from a spacer which allows you to breathe in more often to get everything in. It won't change a whole lot, but for some people it is more pleasent and it's easier to use in an attack. Those can be bought without a doctor being involved and cost around 20 ‚Ç¨ where I live.(#2)Is it not possible for you to ask who to see specifically at your surgery so you can see the asthma nurse? It usually is - although you may have to wait longer for an appointment if they are busy. They're a crap surgery if they aren't keen to direct you to the appropriate person for your specific problem (and most are keen to because it frees up the doctors if they can have people see the nurse etc), rather than you just getting the luck of the draw. If it is the case that you can't ask to see someone specific, you could consider registering at another surgery.

The few times I have seen the GP about my asthma, yeah, I haven't always found them that helpful, but the asthma nurse is always really knowledgable and I'd always rather see them than any doctor.

Clenil is a steroid only inhaler, so the most likely move from that, rather than trying different steroids, would be to go onto a steroid + LABA. I'm on Fostair, which is a commonly prescribed one in the UK, it's the same steroid as clenil but has a LABA; it's way better than just being on the clenil.(#3)So a break down of the types daily asthma inhalers:

Steroid: That is what you are currently on. Just a basic oral steroid inhaler that is used to reduce inflammation in the lungs. 

LABA: Long-acting beta-agonists, these are most commonly found as a combination inhaler with a steroid. Such as Symbicort or Advair. A Long-acting beta-agonists, does what an Albuterol inhaler does but for a longer period. 

LAMA: Long-acting muscarinic antagonists, these are not as common for asthmatics. More commonly seen in COPD meds. Spiriva, is one you might have heard of. LAMA's are a longer version of the magic half of a Duoneb.(#4)Are you in the UK?
I was on clenil 200 but reacted terribly to it so I‚Äôve been swapped to flixotide 50 which I take two puffs twice a day(#5)Agreeing with the first comment. A typical preventer inhaler contains ICS + LABA as explained.

Most of their differences is the steroid component. Some brands would have the same LABA but different steroid.

Then there is an inhaler which has fine particles meaning they get into the smaller airways than the regular ones. The only one I know is fostair, its near equivalent of the regular one would be symbicort.

Then there are newer inhalers which have all three LABA+ICS+LAMA (e.g. trelegy). 

Treatment is always personalised, sometimes you just have to try them all and see which one will work. If they don't, doctor might do a step up which means adding more meds."
Asthma attack or panic attack? Help Please?,13,1.0,13,"(#1)You need to address the tooth infection. They can lead to other problems and that could be the cause of the other symptoms. Go to the hospital if you have a feeling of dread about your health.(#2)I would probably just monitor your symptoms, what type of inhaler are you using? Albuterol or steroid inhaler?(#3)Switching from Motrin to ibuprofen should make no difference. Do you have any allergies?(#4)You need to go to the dentist and take care of the tooth. A tooth infection could cause an infection in your heart.

Taking an Advil would not cause this. Motrin and Advil are the exact same thing.(#5)i agree monitor your symptoms . both asthma and anxiety ! both can go hand in hand . hope you feel better soon both anxiety and asthma suck(#6)In addition to my other comment, I want to address these two points:

>Would the ibuprofen (400mg) still be affecting me 4 hours later, even if it did trigger my asthma?

Generally, ibuprofen lasts 1 hour per 100mg (adults can have up to 2400mg/day, in doses of 800mg/8hours). So, yes, 400mg ibu would still be in your system at 4 hours, but wearing off.

>Should I go to the ER or just monitor my symptoms for now?

If you have super good insurance, no reason not to. Otherwise, take an over the counter antihistamine (loratadine or cetirizine are non-drowsy options, but diphenhydramine works better), and see how you feel after. If you feel significantly better after the antihistamine, schedule an appointment with your doc to discuss allergy testing, and avoid brand name Advil in the meantime. Otherwise, it's probably not an allergic reaction.(#7)I took 800 mg from my knee acting up, and coughed for two days...well, I coughed more than usual for 2 daya.(#8)If you have of pulse oximeter then check your blood oxygen saturation. If it's a panic attack and hyperventilation, then your blood will be high in oxygen content and you should expect an O2 concentration of between 98-100%. If it's an asthma attack you'll see a decline from the average values of between 90-100. Anything below 90 should be a concern and would warrant immediate treatment. If your oxygen saturation still doesn't increase after the use of a rescue inhaler or breathing treatment then seek emergency medical attention.

Just a quick note: Everyone in general, and especially those that are apart of this subreddit, should purchase a pulse oximeter. It's an immensely useful investment and for $20 it could very well save your life.

Holy Basil good for Asthma?,2,0.67,20,"(#1)Albuterol and clean air are good for asthma. There are no ""alternative"" substances or treatments that work well for asthma, because then they would be prescribed by your Dr, and be mainstream, not alternative. Get real meds, and stop wasting time, suffering, and damaging your lungs with BS.(#2)My experience with Holy Basil is that it is a fucking delicious tea.

I still have severe asthma and lung problems but at least I also have a nice cup of tea.

Get real medicine from real doctors....don't mess around with your lungs trying things that will not work.

But as a cozy drink it is daaammmnnn delicious.(#3)Don't listen to the utter claptrap being spouted that only Albuterol or equivalents can be effective for asthma. People had and treated asthma long before they had access to Albuterol. Despite what people seem to be saying, plenty of research is being done into herbal treatments, and plenty of doctors are aware of the benefits.

I use, in full consultation with my doctor and asthma nurse, mullein as a preventative for my asthma symptoms. Since using it, I have not needed to use my preventer for over a year. I have moderate asthma and still keep an emergency inhaler for e.g. heavy exercise, though, because I'm not stupid!

As to whether Holy Basil will work, the trick is often what your asthma is caused by, and what it responds to. Not all herbal meds will have an impact on the same things, so some may have a more useful effect for you than others. Studies appear to exist pointing to some activity against asthma when taking tulsi (holy basil) daily, but do some solid reading and consult your doctor if you're concerned. Definitely do not cold turkey other meds in favour of taking herbs - work off them slowly if you're seeing benefits. Check for issues with medication your on and the herbs you plan to take, too.(#4)Not sure about Basil, but fish oil does help mine a good bit.(#5)I‚Äôm originally from Colombia and I‚Äôm 40 y/o. I can assure you that growing up I‚Äôve tried hundreds of homeopathic treatments, shark oil, iguana oil, volcanic mud, who knows how many herbs, and who knows what else that I cant remember. Going right now though a nasty cold and asthma flare up in beautiful Utah, and just this evening my mom on the phone was asking me to find a slaughterhouse, get some hooves, boil them and inhale the vapor‚Ä¶ I guess Moms never stop being moms‚Ä¶ but I rather stick to my inhaler and my prednisone. Some of those homeopathic remedies did help, but it was always temporarily. As I said, 40 yo and still dealing with this cruel condition"

How do I get an inhaler?,5,0.86,21,"(#1)I have asthma. I have had to have a nebulizer treatment before.  I have a lapsed RX for Albuterol but I don‚Äôt see doctors. I have CPTSD and GAD and I‚Äôm ashamed of my weight gain and feel weird / unworthy about asking for stuff. I know it‚Äôs stupid. CPTSD is a bitch.

I take a daily OTC antihistamine which helps a little but I‚Äôm still sometimes having chest pain, coughing, like wheezing and a little gaspy. Air quality factors into this. I just coughed and coughed up junk.

Because of my fatalist mentality throughout my life I think I‚Äôm going to have a foreshortened lifespan so I neglect myself sometimes.

My kids are going in for their well child visit soon (vaccinations and stuff) do I have to have my own appointment at the Doctors‚Äô office just to get my RX? I got my nebulizer treatment there.

Anyways, back to you wanting an inhaler. You can get maintenance inhalers and rescue inhalers without a prescription from alldaychemist and inhousepharmacy . Both will send you your orders without a prescription and are super legit.

PEF vs FEV,2,1.0,6,(#1)How much of a decline ?(#2)In my case it‚Äôs usually the other way around. Do you take a steroid inhaler?
Advice please! My throat and chest have felt tight for over a week and I feel dizzy and fatigued. I have intermittent bouts of a dry cough.,11,1.0,6,"(#1)Some of these symptoms sound like acid reflux. When people typically think of acid reflux, they think of heartburn, but it's not always heartburn and often, it's much more than that. I suffer with both asthma and acid reflux and it's hard to know which is causing the symptoms, but if the inhalers not bringing you relief, it very well could be acid. I have the throat tightness and the shortness of breath. Those are all things that can be caused by acid reflux, same with the sinus congestion. I would see a gastroenterologist so they can rule that out.

Also I want to add the dizziness and especially the dry cough can be caused by acid reflux! I even get ringing in my ears and I've had a million tests by neurologists and audiologists and they all come back normal.. I'm beginning to think even that is a result of acid reflux.(#2)This doesn‚Äôt seem like asthma to me but if you go to a pulmonologist they give you a test that shows if you are breathing ok. This could also be related to your lung or heart or it could be psychosomatic"
Asthama treatment & chances to pass onto kids:,6,0.75,21,"(#1)Hi, I understand the worries but keep in mind that if your wife has asthma it does not mean that your children will have asthma or not necessarily in a bad / chronic form. I cannot judge the specific context but it seems a bit extreme to break up just for the risk of asthma in your future children.

I have a few resources to recommend
1) This research group has recruited 3500 children and observed them for 10 years to understand which factors contribute to the development of asthma and allergies. They summarized their findings here. Obviously nothing guarantees that these factors will prevent asthma, just that they have a hypothesis that this might help 
https://childstudy.ca/portfolio/key-discoveries/

2) This study done in a similar way shows that supplementation with fish oil during the last trimester of pregnancy resulted in a 30% lower risk of asthma. In mothers with asthma, this result was even more striking! 

https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/fish-oil-derived-fatty-acids-in-pregnancy-and-wheeze-and-asthma-i

3) I really enjoyed the book ‚ÄúGrow healthy babies‚Äù by Michelle Henning. She reviewed 700+ publications of factors that influence the risk of getting allergies and asthma and gives suggestions on lifestyles that might help during pregnancy 
https://www.growhealthybabies.com

To round off, keep in mind that we don‚Äôt yet know how to prevent asthma and unfortunately it‚Äôs a complicated disease that comes from a mix of genetics and environment. Hope these reads are helpful(#2)I am a married woman with asthma,  and 3 kids...and just read your post to my husband,  who LITERALLY laughed out loud.  Called it complete nonsense.
(Which is pretty awesome considering my asthma is severe)
My oldest son thought for sure this post was on AITAH.
Progression of disease varies greatly by individual.  For most people it's a minor annoyance.(#3)I certainly hope you told your family to shove it and actually stood by your gf, but unfortunately you posting this here suggests otherwise...and all I can say is: I really hope you work on yourself BEFORE marrying her and having children with her because quite frankly, she deserves far better.(#4)You're family is horrible if they are telling you to ditch your girlfriend.

My SO and I have been married for almost 19 years now. My SO has never once even thought my asthma was a reason for us to not be together. My asthma has not brought any stress to our relationship. Other things like jerks in the family cause more stress so we simply cut ties with them.

Asthma may or may not have a genetic component. No one else in my family has it.

I just had my SO read your post and all it caused is a lot of laughter. SO's comment was if you're worked up about something as trivial as asthma, what are you going to do when actual huge problems happen? For reference, I'm a severe asthmatic and I do not expect my spouse to baby me or take care of me. We take care of each other if one of us is sick.(#5)Hey, ive had asthma since i was 2 years old, almost 14 years I've had it now, it does get easier as life goes on, but there is always times where it will be harder, even if it seems like its fully gone. 

how to handle it? as i said before, it does get easier and it just becomes a part of life, but i would say, expose yourself to the stuff that triggers it. dogs used to be a huge part of it, my love for animals and wanting to become a vet made me see animals more, so, as i got older, i was around animals more and more, and now my allergy to dogs and how much it affects my asthma, is gone. i have done this with tons of other things. dogs, the cold, exercise, pollen, dust.. you name it. 

how to prevent it? there isn't really a way to prevent asthma fully, you can just make it easier over time. sometimes it gets passed down over genetics, maybe it just shows up, it never really goes away, there is a chance you can grow out of it, but other than that, there is not really a way to prevent Asthma.

how should you do family planning? see if your wife has any allergies or see if her asthma would be affected by anything with the thing you are doing. try to get her to do some stuff and never forget her inhaler if there is a chance of her asthma kicking in during the stuff you are doing.

if you love her, you would stay with her, if you broke up with her just because of something she can't control like a medical obstacle, that wouldn't really be fair to her. if your family is suggesting you break up with her because of their views on it, don't listen to them, asthma shouldn't get that in the way of things. 

There is always a chance that it will get passed down to your kids. I got it from my dad, but my 2 brothers didn't. 

Hope this information helps a little :)(#6)My twin u/buzzybnz and I lost the genetic lottery. Both sides of our family had mild asthma and there were some allergies etc too. However, we were born 2 months premature and that was really what caused problems. 

We have a full brother who has mild asthma now and then, a half sister who has asthma when it suits her and a half brother with problems now and then. 

Personally, I chose not to have children. It was not *only* because of what I might pass on to them (I have A LOT of other problems.) but the fact that I wouldn't always be able to take proper care of my child.(#7)Just to chip in; neither of my parents have it, yet all three of us kids have it to varying degrees. I think its just mainly a combo of environmental factors and genes.(#8)Do not smoke. Do not marry a smoker. Do not let anyone smoke around you or your children. No vaping, either. Do not go into smokers‚Äô homes. I‚Äôm extremely reactive to third hand smoke (walls, furniture, carpeting.)

Be careful about going out in poor air quality.

My mother is asthmatic but smoked like a chimney (indoors and in the car) and I had pneumonia when I was 12. I think her second/third hand smoke broke my lungs.(#9)I‚Äôd be more worried about passing on your family‚Äôs manners and views than your wife‚Äôs asthma. I think they are equally genetic.(#10)What do you mean the risks you can take?"
My son and asthma,18,0.95,19,"(#1)Dust is always there, even if you cannot see it. Dusting and cleaning puts dust in the air. As a kid well meaning people would clean before I visited and it often got all the allergens in the air, added cleaning chemicals in the air and made it worse for me.
A good hepa filter in the bedroom can help. 
Do not clean right before bed time if possible.
If you have a large freezer buy a switch out of pillows. Freeze the pillows and switch out every week or so. This could help if it is a dust mite allergy. (Same thing for stuffed animals and such).(#2)I can only second what others have already said about cleaning and dust: In your effort to keep the room as dust-free as possible, you may actually make it worse by getting dust (and additional irritants from cleaning products) into the air by cleaning too often.

Definitely get him a good HEPA air filter for his room, turn it on an hour or two before bedtime and let it run through the night if possible.

Another thing you may want to check for is mold in his room. Mold can hide very well, unfortunately, even behind furniture and wall paper and inside walls, but you can at least check for visible mold (move furniture off the walls to check behind too, and don't forget to check the mattress). If he has an allergist, you can ask for an allergy test for mold allergy and at the same time have him checked for dust mites, any pets if you have any at home, and maybe pollen too (mine was diagnosed via prick test so adding a few more allergens to the test isn't that big of a deal for doctors--it's one small prick per allergen, plus two pricks for the two control substances).(#3)Have you tried cleaning or replacing the pillow? They can get gross and be a huge source of allergens.(#4)All good suggestions. His mattress should be in a zippered dust mite proof cover as well. 

How old is your house? You might consider having the air ducts cleaned. I had that done as soon as I moved into my house. Also, make sure you‚Äôre using a good filter on the air return and that you replace it when it‚Äôs dirty.(#5)Adding on to what others said about the cleaning. If you‚Äôre using strong chemicals to clean his room every day it might be making the problem worse, not better. Cold air, mold, scented detergents, reflux could also be the source, but if he sleeps fine in your bed and you‚Äôre cleaning that room less frequently it might just be dust and fumes in the air. Make sure not to use air fresheners or humidifiers that aren‚Äôt cleaned very regularly either.(#6)See if there‚Äôs an allergist in your area and see if he can get your kiddo some allergy meds to help, or try some OTC allergy meds. Zyrtec/Centrizine and Clartitin/Loratadine really helps me. When I was his age, I used to have to do nebulizer treatments so frequently my parents went and bought a nebulizer for home. I‚Äôm allergic to dust as well, and the combination of allergy meds and my asthma meds really helped control my asthma. The other thing that might help is a humidifier. Sometimes, dry air can make asthma flare up, so a room humidifier (like one of the ones they sell at Walmart or Target) can help as well(#7)1st, bit a nebulizer for home.

2nd, Treat the allergies. 

If he's coughing in doors at night, he probably has dust mite allergies.  You can test for them at the allergist. Get him on antihistamine everyday. Talk to your Dr about getting him on Flonase at night to prevent postnasal drip. In parallel, start getting allergy shots, or depending on location Exact Immunoplasty. That will treat allergies, and will drastically improve his asthma. Unfortunately dust mites will be in every space humans occupy, even with thorough cleaning, so treating the allergy will work better long term than trying to mitigate first mites. 

Getting allergy shots was the best thing I did for my asthma, and home nebulizer has kept me out of the hospital countless times.(#8)Are his pillows, mattress and box springs encased allergy-proof coverings? They have much better ones than the loud crinkled plastic ones we used to have available. No drapes, plastic blinds that are easy to wipe down and no carpeting in his bedroom. The allergist my youngest had also recommended slightly elevating the head of the bed to make it easier to breathe at night. Someone also mentioned stuffed animals. It is so tough to remove them but they are full of dust. My youngest kept only one favorite that was washable and would sit in front of the dryer each week waiting for it to be finished drying.

Has your son had allergy testing? There might be something in his environment that triggers him at night. It isn‚Äôt always easy to figure out asthma triggers.(#9)When my kid was that age, he had asthma too, but not nearly as severe. One thing the doctor prescribed was daily kids claritin. There is a chewable variety. If it's ok with the doctor you could at least try that because it's cheap and pretty easy on kids. You need to take it for several days in a row to build up in your body.(#10)Is it cold in his room? Cold used to set off my child‚Äôs asthma when younger, so we always had a heater on in cool weather to keep the air warm. If asthma is well controlled you shouldn‚Äôt be needing to use the blue reliever puffer often. You might need to talk to his doctor about stepping up preventer medication. We also use antihistamine and steroid nasal spray to help with allergies/asthma. That‚Äôs something to ask your doctor about too. Also, just wondering if you use proper dust mite covers on his mattress and pillow if he has a dust mite allergy?(#11)We tore out all carpet and put in hardwood floors, HEPA vacuum, allergy mattress and pillow covers, washed frequently. Change HVAC filters frequently. Change cabin filter in all cars. We did allergy shots, both me and kiddo.(#12)If it‚Äôs in budget and you don‚Äôt already have hard wood floors, look into getting them. Carpets trap dust and debris(#13)I've suffered from moderate/severe asthma since my 20s. The only thing that ever worked for me was reducing my gluten intake. When I was pretty strict with my diet, I went from being in steroids for months to not having any asthma symptoms for a year and a half.(#14)Have you tried a HEPA filter machine in his room? When we have wildfires/smog these seem to be a Godsend.

I agree about the humidifier (make it a warm one.)(#15)We changed all our house flooring to hard surfaces wood and engineered wood.  Hot showers helped when my son was this age.
Also he takes anti histamine every day and that helps hugely"
Asthma Advice?,2,0.75,6,"(#1)You should not inhale anything but air. Toss the juul in the trash and if you're going to indulge, use edibles.(#2)Yes, mine is caused by allergies which are worse now that I‚Äôve also moved further south. Allergies can also just get worse over the years, so I‚Äôd consider seeing an allergist if I were you, just get tested and if the test is dramatically positive you likely have your answer. When I get what I think is the same sound you‚Äôre describing, it‚Äôs from excess mucous that‚Äôs building up because of the irritation from the allergies. 

In the meantime, if you think it is allergies and want to try something, you can add a daily antihistamine (something like Allegra or Zyrtec, which might take a couple of weeks of daily use to really take effect) and maybe even consider a neti pot/nasal rinse. It‚Äôll help rinse out any allergens that get in and build up during the day. You might also try a nasal spray like Flonase or nasacort (if you do the nasal rinse and this you use those sprays after the rinse). 

I also strongly recommend switching methods of your marijuana use to something that isn‚Äôt inhaled, asthma and inhaling things that aren‚Äôt regular air or your medication is a recipe for disaster. Stay on that inhaler, and (if you see one) the allergist can add meds that might help depending on what they find(#3)Quit juuling. I quit when it started fucking up my lunges. You gotta quit before it gets worse"
Have you ever had a teacher or person of authority refuse to let you take your inhaler?,43,0.94,18,"(#1)I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that. I hope that is no longer the case where you are, and the younger generation doesn‚Äôt have to go through it.

I know in Ontario a child died because he couldn‚Äôt get to his inhaler in time. They have then passed a law that ensures children with asthma can carry their own.  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan%27s_Law_(Canada)

As I work in a school, I make sure kids carry their own on them, and also have backup at the school should they forget it or lose it somewhere.(#2)I carried my inhaler from a very young age. My parents made it clear that my doctor had taught me how to recognize the need to use my inhaler, how to use it, and my parents instructed me to take it as directed. They told the school that nowhere in that process was any teacher or other school official involved, and any attempt to interfere would be considered battery.(#3)My mom insisted that my inhaler be in my backpack as a kid. I had a teacher that wouldn‚Äôt let me bring it up to the field for gym class and wouldn‚Äôt let my friend go get it ‚Äî I ended up passing out when she made me try to run the mile even though she knew I had a doctors note that I had to walk the mile. I had to get taken to the nurse‚Äôs office in a wheelchair and I‚Äôll never ever forget my mom coming through that office like a freaking hurricane when they called her in. 

At a certain age, children with asthma know what they‚Äôre doing and need to be trusted with their medical needs. It‚Äôs insane to me that schools will require inhalers to be kept in the front office, which may be far away, and things can change so quickly with an asthma attack in seconds(#4)YES!! FUUCK ABUSIVE TEACHERS(#5)Breathing exercises can help as a preventative. It sounds counterintuitive, but while my husband was in high school band, his asthma was much more manageable since he had to pay attention to breath volume, do circular breathing, etc.

They tried keeping my inhaler away from me in school. My parents and I agreed that was a stupid rule and I kept it on me anyway, with the understanding that they'd defend me if I was caught with it.(#6)My stepmother took it off me and refused to let me take it. I think I was staying with them for a week or so, at the time I didn‚Äôt think to mention it to dad, so I guess I just suffered. I told my mother when I got home, I think she called dad later. It didn‚Äôt happen again at least.(#7)Our middle school office lady said we had to keep them in the office because we might charge other kids money for puffs‚Ä¶ üòÇ(#8)I wish our children could be taught to defy stupidity and arrogance.(#9)A teacher can be dumb too, or a total moron outside his field of knowledge. But to stop a child to take medicine you must be so stupid that it sounds unbelievable. But sadly I know some of the teachers like that too in my school days. We had an evil old sports teacher in elementary school. It was winter, he runs check what kids have full sports gear and what do not. The kids who do not have all items go outside without jackets to spend 45 minutes, and the rest of the kids go to the gym hall. It was like -10 Celsius outside. I say to him I need to go to pee and unlock doors to let the rest of the kids inside in the warm dress room. Later on the end of the activities, he found them making a small party there, he furiously asked ""Who let them in""? I responded ""I did"", then he beat me up, kicked me in the leg I fell and he hit me in my stomach with his leg. I know it sounds horrible now, but that period is was kind of normal for a teacher to kick kids, it was the 90s. Years later when I grow up in all ways. I met him once in street, he was so humble to me, it was funny. I just ask him Do he remember what he did, he says Yes, but that's a sad end of life for a teacher to be remembered for beating kids.(#10)*do they actually work for people?*

I have recently learnt a breathing technique to get your self out of trouble, but this is NOT a substitute for medication.

Breathe in through your nose quickly, then breathe out in an eased, controlled way until your breathing rhythm stabilises.

It has been said often, that swimming training helps asthmatics. Because of the rhythmic breathing associated with it.

Having said that, you need to take your medication, WHEN YOU NEED IT. Not some teacher deciding when. They are on a power trip, nothing more.(#11)Ayo fuck that teacher whoever they were they a bitch bro. Glad you didn‚Äôt pass out. As far as breathing exercises, they can help yeah. Whenever I‚Äôm having coughing fits and it gets too hard to breathe, I resist the urge to cough as much and I focus on slowly breathing and staying calm. It‚Äôs hard sometimes because when you can‚Äôt breathe sometimes you just wanna scream and be angry because it sucks, but with time and practice it can serve as a nice buffer between an asthma attack and your rescue(#12)I didn't have childhood asthma so I've not had someone have that power over me where they can say no. 

Breathing exercise for me do help though. Now once things get past a certain point yeah use the inhaler. 

I have allergic asthma but if I'm having a tough day and I have a speed session planned (I'm a runner) then during warm up I do breathing exercise to breath deep and controlled and get myself to use all my lungs. I find my body will start breathing shallow and I will start hyperventilating if I just don't mindfully pay attention to my breathing. I can very much over come in my mind poor breathing habits early in a run so that my breathing isn't exacerbating my asthma. Once the asthma kicks in though, like I said, hit the inhaler. 

Breathing exercise can be helpful for managing symptoms, they are in no way a replacement for inhalers. 

If I ever do have kids and they have any medical issues, I will be bringing it up to every teacher I see. If anyone told my kid they couldn't use their inhaler, there will be hell to pay. I'm sorry that happened to you.(#13)So, there have been studies done on breathing exercises and reduced inhaler usage thanks to claims that Buteyko breathing ""cures"" asthma.

The end results found that meditative breathing did reduce rescue inhaler usage by half, and it didn't have to be buteyko breathing or anything like that.

The theory as to why this was so effective is that people having a mild asthma attack start to panic and hyperventilate, and that the meditative breathing cuts through this panic cycle. The person has removed themselves from the trigger for their attack, and their attack resolved itself without need for further usage of a rescue inhaler. Hence, breathing exercises work for some individuals during some occasions.

That being said, your teachers are not medically trained to recognize if and when you need your inhaler. They should never restrict you from having to use your inhaler, ever. While asthma is rarely fatal, it can be and should be taken seriously. Your teachers should not have prevented you from using your inhaler and told you to just do some breathing exercises.(#14)When I was in high school, my male gym teacher wouldn't let me stop running laps to go into the locker room and get my inhaler.

I did it anyway, and he followed me into the girls locker room to chew me out for not listening. When he saw that I really had an inhaler, and wasn't lying about asthma, he was still shitty about it. Fuck that guy, he was an alternate for the 1984 Olympic wrestling team, if you want to loom up and guess who he was...(#15)I was diagnosed with asthma in grade 2. Started carrying my inhaler with me. But the teacher took it away saying it was unnecessary for me to keep it on me at all times. So one day I get a severe attack and everyone is running around trying to find the teacher. Turns out she'd taken the day off and my inhaler was with her wherever she was. My mother had to rush to buy me another inhaler at the pharmacy and at the time it was way beyond what we could actually afford but she did it anyway.

Teacher was just suspended for a few days. Throughout primary school she'd hound me saying my asthma was fake and that it wasn't a real condition but at least after that I never made the mistake of giving my inhaler to any teacher to keep.(#16)No actually i was smoking weed i come up to class im like having this coughing attack my teacher goes ‚Äú get your inhaler take it in front of me no more skipping class ‚Äú and he basically baby sat me all day lmfao"
[SAR] Alexander the Great's Little Tickle: The History of Asthma Management (Part 1),9,0.91,0,
Does anyone else get this itchy feeling below their shoulder when having an asthma attack?,11,0.92,8,"(#1)It's very common for an itchy chin or back to be associated with asthma attacks (so anywhere in the same area is definitely possible). It's not well understood why, except that it's probably something to do with a release of histamine.(#2)YES.  Basically any time I can‚Äôt breathe or I‚Äôm out of breath.  Absolutely.(#3)Upper back, sometimes neck, sometimes chest.(#4)I get itchy in my upper back between my shoulder blades!(#5)I do!! always between the shoulder blades, usually on my right side.(#6)Yes, I experience this often between the shoulders and on the neck and upper chest before asthma exasperation. I will get flushing, sometimes hives in those areas too."
Asthma and pollen - what works for you?,9,0.81,27,"(#1)Use an antihistamine? You claim to not have allergies yet have an uptick of symptoms around a common allergen. Allergy symptoms can also be hives/ itchy skin, trouble breathing, and swelling too. My kiddo is screwed without them. When she was younger she was on Flovent, Singulair, and Flonase for symptom control.

Mask mandates may be out but they really helped with pollen. On windy days, I'm still masked.(#2)Allergy meds + more asthma meds + keeping windows closed when home and vacuuming more than usual + air purifiers at home, especially in the bedroom

Talk to your doctor, share your concerns, and make sure you know what to do in an emergency and have a plan for the slow build in symptoms (allergy season, when you have a cold etc)(#3)I'm wondering how you know you are having allergy problems without having allergy symptoms?(#4)If you are doing any yard work wear an N95 mask. I have been doing this for years and it works like a charm.(#5)What you describe ARE seasonal allergies. You just don‚Äôt suffer from allergic rhinitis. 
You clearly need to see an allergist (for testing)and a wise pulmonologist to determine the best controller protocol for you. It might be a different medication. It might be multiple inhalers. (I‚Äôm on 3 controller inhalers daily) 
But the important thing is, you need to be tested to see what your triggers are, and then you need to manage them appropriately.
Singular is usually paired with an antihistamine.(#6)I hear you that you think you don't experience seasonal allergies, but I feel like you may be mistaken. I'm not a doctor but I also used to experience worse asthma symptoms during certain times of the year, and my doctor told me to try a daily allergy med. It helped a lot! It helped with symptoms I didn't even know were affecting me because I had just gotten used to it. A lot of the good allergy meds are OTC now, and if you have a costco or sams club memership you can get them for a lot cheaper than at the grocery store. I actually just switched, from generic for zyrtec to generic for claritin. If you don't know which one to start with, ask your doctor for suggestions. Both of the meds I took are non-drowsy and did not have any negative side effects that I noticed.(#7)Long time pollen sufferer. Gets worse with age, I found. For years I was popping antihistamines like candy, only to have a host of side effects. These were the strategies that worked for me: 1)keep using the maintenance inhaler (Alvesco), even during the season my asthma goes away. 2) Fluticasone nasal spray.  3) stay off gluten (it severely exacerbates the itchiness and rhinitis).  
4) Take a shower when you come home, to rid yourself of allergens before you go to bed. 5) wear a mask on windy days (I even wear googles while gardening).(#8)Change your cloths when you come in and wipe down your face and hair.  Shower too quit often.(#9)Singulair and a non drowsy antihistamine work for me(#10)SAME HERE !!! FLOVANT 250 FHA !! man i was inside the whole time and my asthma was real bad . i took a walk and my asthma started going off . tbh im scared to for this summer as well but i just got a new allergist(#11)Stay indoors(#12)I keep eating cetirizine until it stops.(#13)For me taking an antihistamine(everyday) help but also doing saline nose cleaning help keep nose clean. Also you need a good air purifier with a good filter close to you at home and if possible at work."
Smoking weed after/comedown of asthma flare up,0,0.5,10,"(#1)You really should not be smoking anything, it will aggravate or make asthma worse most of the time, please use a different method if you want to continue using marijuana. General rule I follow is nothing goes in my lungs expect regular air and my meds (when I can help it - I‚Äôm a huge fan of banning smoking in public and any shared housing but that‚Äôs a different issue).(#2)Smoke is always going to be bad for your lungs. When you combust something a lot of particulate matter goes out that settles into your lungs and then you have to work extra hard to cough it out. The irritation from that triggers inflammation and triggers your asthma to be worse. Vaping is not good either because it deposits particulate matter that you can't cough out.

Overtime if you keep smoking it could irritate your lungs so much that you end up having irreversible damage. The purpose of asthma medicines isn't just to keep you breathing but to prevent that long-term damage from happening because then you get into some really scary territory with much worse symptoms and treatment than what you are likely currently seeing.

A great harm reduction step is edibles. Brownies, cookies, mints, gummies, whatever works for you. With any edible you just want to start low and go slow. Which means take a little bit wait half an hour to an hour see how it hits you take a little bit more. Over time you will begin to understand how much is a good amount for you to eat to get the high that you want.(#3)I used to be a stoner and I'd basically just power through my asthma just to get high. I'd go through my inhalers ridiculously quick. I've quit now and while I miss it, my asthma is 10 times better and doing simple physical tasks no longer triggers it. You be better off if you quit smoking all together, but really if you just tone it back to once every few days youl notice a big improvement. Look into getting a dry herb vaporizer. It vaporizes the THC without actually combusting the plant so your not getting the harmful smoke. Better yet, switch over to edibles, you can get as high as you want without any asthma side effects.(#4)Edibles, my friend. No vaping, no smoking and no exposure to exhaust or smoke of any type.(#5)There‚Äôs really no reason to be putting smoke into your lungs in the era of widely available edibles, tictures, oils, etc.  No asthmatic should be smoking combusted material.  It‚Äôs awful for you.(#6)i feel you on this . smoking weed always aggravated my asthma(#7)Maybe try edibles or else one of those electronic weed burner things(#8)No, there is no way you can trigger your asthma on purpose and get away with it. Just don't. Why would you cause problems where they are non?

If you cannot stop, you should look into addiction. Yes, weed won't make you physically addicted, but you can be psychological dependent on it.(#9)Smoking is stupid if you have asthma. Your lungs are already damaged so go ahead and damage them some more."

A huge relief especially in fire seasons(#13)I can barely breathe today. Of course I got bad sinus infection from allergies like every year and once again I am on antibiotics.

Well at least I still haven't started my new job so I can sleep through my sickness.

Though it would be nice to be able to breathe.(#14)Would getting a mechanical bed frame work or using 2 pillows?(#15)Mmmhmmmm.... tbh I get like a 2 week reprieve in the deepest, darkest, coldest, deadest part of winter where I live, and that's about it.

Where I live allergy season is never over. It just roams between intensity levels of mild irritation guaranteed,  bad, and breathing will try to kill you.(#19)I'm trying to figure out my allergies, I know I have them really bad. One day I woke up wheezy, that scared me, I never condsidered them to be that bad, and sometimes out of nowhere, I'll start coughing. Just sitting watching tv. My vision will get all blurry. I do have bad hay fever. Lately, I was just wondering what is going on?"
Belching,2,0.75,9,"(#1)Have you tried taking an antacid? Asthma and GERD tend to go hand in hand, and you could have GERD without the acidic taste.(#2)Have you checked with your doctor about GERD? 

Stomach acid flare ups can start inflammation on your throat which makes it harder to breathe. Same has happened to me, asthma since birth and acid reflux lead to uncontrollable GERd before i realized i need to see a doctor(#3)Sounds like GERD.(#4)Had the same problem, although it‚Äôs probably GERD my doctor had me try antacids and when those didn‚Äôt help started investigating into a potential Hatial Hernia. I also have bloating, discomfort and shortness of breath after eating and reflux.(#5)Check with a doctor. If I recall correctly, this can be a sign of something more serious."
Getting Flovent for cheap online (Canadian Rx),1,0.67,14,"(#1)Talk to your doctor about trying a different inhaler or ask for samples.(#2)Try another pharmacy. Just pick up from Walmart for 15$. 100mcg. If I remember correctly at shoppers is was 71$ no insurance. It has been awhile tho since I purchased from there. I‚Äôve been getting my grandmother to bring some from the Caribbean for last 2 years. The currency conversion is like 2 CAD an inhaler. Lol


Edit: that‚Äôs for Ventolin btw. I haven‚Äôt used Flovent in some years(#3)...there isnt a generic for Flovent. Dont walk but run from whatever site told you that.

Does it HAVE to be Flovent? Flonase is the same thing (fluticasone) different method of getting it and does come in a generic. There are also other maintenence inhalers that do come in generic.(#4)A Canadian online pharmacy will still need to be registered with a provincial college of pharmacy. Generic flovent is available in Canada, it's cheaper but can't remember how much cheaper(#5)Try albuterol way cheaper like 30$(#6)My flovant i pay nothing üò≥"
Shortness of breath around 7-9 pm,6,0.81,26,"(#1)Is it after you eat? Reflux can cas issues. Also if you are super full the extra pressure pushing on lungs can make it harder to breath.(#2)I can't help you but this is the most specific thing I've ever heard.(#3)It could be either reflux causing your asthma (from lying down), or you‚Äôre allergic to the dust mites in your bedding or pillows or couch. Both are common causes of asthma. You can get special covers to avoid dust mites and a wedge pillow can help with reflux. The nausea might point to reflux as well- look into ‚Äúsilent reflux.‚Äù(#4)Do you take a daily inhaler? If so is it a once a day one? I was having that issue when I was on like breo. I have to have a daily inhaler that's twice a day apparently(#5)Same with me but it could be because season changing soon.(#6)This happened to me in terms of allergies. And I was taking Claritin every morning. Talking it out with my friends we figured my asthma-lite was flaring up cause the Claritin was starting to wear off. 
So now I'm taking Singulair with it every morning to tide me over in the coverage gap.(#7)You may actually have reflux rather than asthma.(#8)I always have shortness of breath at night, not sure how my body knows but once the sun goes down my nose gets stuffed up and it‚Äôs alittle headed to breath! The nausea could be from mucus collecting.(#9)it may be the dust laying around, I used to be like this too, not as bad I don't think but I'm thinking it may just be the dust around your bed and room?"
"Tested positive for omicron this morning. Having a bit of difficulty breathing, did you keep taking your Symbicort?",4,0.84,17,"(#1)yes most definitely continue with your asthma meds .(#2)If your country has a non emergency line, please call then. It will give you a faster answer.(#3)I had covid and took my symbicort throughout my infection. I normally get asthma with every cold but was lucky to not get any asthma with covid(#4)I ended up needing prednisone. Call your doctor.(#5)I was switched to Vannair when I tested positive 10 days ago. I still can't get a good enough breath for Symbicort. You need to speak to your doctor.

ETA: I have also required Prednisone(#6)Yes, keep taking it. If it's the preventer inhaler ( I'm not sure) then I take double if I'm ill with a cold or covid. That's what I've been told to do by my asthma nurse.(#7)Why would you stop taking your controller med?(#8)You could speak with your doctor.  I had delta and omicron. Both Aggravated my asthma.  Delta much worse. Had very slight pneumonia in one lung.(#9)I also did a round of Dexamethasone and needed a 2nd round of Prednisone. You'll get through this. Lots of rest if you can.(#10)Doctors are using Symbicort and the ICS in it to treat covid patients. source: I work in a hospital. 

As a result, when I got covid, I switched from Flovent to the Symbicort inhaler I'd kept on hand in case I contracted covid."
Painful upper back and chest is this normal?,6,0.88,14,"(#1)Sounds like pleurisy maybe but probably worth seeing a doctor if it carries on.(#2)Asthma can strain the muscles that support your spine and lead to back pain. This happens to me often and I just take ibuprofen and stretch while I try get my asthma under control. It scares me though, until I remember why it happens. Maybe try some Advil and yoga to get it worked out as best you can while it heals. Look up ""asthma and back pain"" for more info.(#3)go to urgent care. You may be having a cardiac episode.(#4)If it‚Äôs pain in the ribs, it could be costochondritis.(#5)If it‚Äôs pain in the ribs, it could be costochondritis."
Asthma symptoms but good peak flow?,4,1.0,4,"(#1)My peak flow doesn't seem to go down till the day after I have a reaction to something.  I'll feel my airways burning, and my breathing will be rapid and shallow, but my peak flow will still be normal till I wake up the next day.(#2)I have similar problems and my respirologist thinks it may be exercise induced paradoxical vocal cord disorder which needs to be diagnosed by an Ear Nose Throat doctor and treated with a speech language pathologist.

Could also be muscle tension in accessory breathing muscles?

Look into it and see if this seems like you.  Good luck!(#3)This happened to me and it turned out to be GERD. In my case, my rescue inhaler was also not as effective as it normally is. The shortness of breath was also coming from my throat. 

You can try taking an over the counter antacid (like Pepcid) before your run and see if it makes a difference. It did wonders for me.  

If it is GERD, than also avoid eating or drinking a lot before your run.(#4)Check for GERD and Vocal Cord Dysfunction."
Never stop Prednisone without tapering!!! I learned the hard way.,24,1.0,5,"(#1)It's more important the higher the dose. 

Always talk to your doc about your asthma meds.(#2)

Damn thats what i need right now. Been having flare ups and inhaler isnt cutting it. 
Took it lots as a kid/teen but not since.
Thanks for jolting my memory. And the safty warming(#3)Here's an excerpt from another discussion about Prednisolone, I wrote yesterday:

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

First thing : DO NOT be casual with tapering off. This has to be strictly adhered to and follow your doctor's regime. Particularly coming down off high doses. Failure to do this, could induce another flare up of Sarcoidosis and the entire procedure will have to be done again.  
  
Even at the small doses, below 10mg, you cannot just drop them and think that is OK. It has to be remembered, it is not the amount that is changing, but the percentage of the change in dose that matters. Small doses from say 2.5mg, to 1mg, represents over 50% drop in dosage levels. This can be just as bad, if not worse than coming down from 50mg to 37.5mg. Prednisolone works like that.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I'm a chronic Asthmatic and chronic Pulmonary Sarcoidosis sufferer. I have had long courses of Prednisolone, starting at 50mg over two nine months blocks to treat the Sarcoid.

Prednisolone is not to be messed with.(#4)In your research did you come across that nasty Prednisone Rash? Google ""Prednisone Rash"" and click on the Images!(#5)I went through a very similar experience back in October, it got so bad I had to call 911 for an ambulance! The extraordinary fatigue, I couldn‚Äôt hold a cup of water for instance because I didn‚Äôt have the strength too, the rapid heart palpitations, the inability to eat anything, and blood pressure dropping so low that I almost fainted‚Ä¶I did the same thing and googled side effects of prednisone and voila‚Ä¶my adrenal glands had stopped working well hence all the side effects! Everyone please be careful with prednisone, damned if you do damned if you don‚Äôt kinda situation"

Reducing risk of asthma in children,4,0.75,14,"(#1)Cats and dogs and a little bit of muck is best imho, to build strong immune systems(#2)The biggest thing my parents did that contributed to my asthma was smoke in the car or near me as a kid.  Asthma is part genetics but also part environmental. You can't help the genetics part but you can definitely help the latter.  Don't clutter your baby's room with stuffed animals (dust magnets) clean clean clean and invest in a really good HEPA air purifier.(#3)Asthma is caused by a mix of genetics and environmental. You could live in the cleanest area ever and there‚Äôs a still a chance to pass it to your kids and you have zero control over it. It‚Äôs pretty much luck.(#4)there is always a chance that it will get passed down in genetics, I always joke around that my dad gave me his asthma, (I got it at 2 years old) I think exposing your kids to kinds of different stuff *may* help but you cant prevent asthma. if they do end up getting it, expose them to what they are allergic to. i was allergic to a lot of things with my asthma, I exposed myself to many more things and now they don't bother me at all. 

the main things I was exposed to and don't affect me anymore are smoking, dog dandruff, pollen, exercise (I'm still working on that one, almost gone), cold.(#5)No smoking. No second or third hand smoke. No vaping."
The day before it rains my breathing gets pretty bad,6,0.88,4,"(#1)Air pressure changes always effect my chest. Not sure if there is anyway to counteract it.(#2)I'm the same and we're having rain right now. Especially thunder ‚õàÔ∏è‚ö°.(#3)I think nothing except the usual - inhaler, stay calm and breath calm, stay in good physical shape, stay hydrated. I feel worse a few hours before storms. There is one thing that could help which is staying indoors if you can on those days. I might have read that it can have something to do with pollen counts, that they go crazy when there is a storm about to come.(#4)Doesn't bother my asthma but it does indeed bother most of my joints."
Asthma in a child,6,0.88,9,"(#1)Are you seeing a PCP, pulmonologist, or urgent care/ ER doctors? Urgent care and ER focus on stabilization at that moment. They generally don't help long term other than telling a PCP why you were seen.(#2)This sounds similar to my 2.5 year  old that was diagnosed with ""Reactive Airways Disease"" in October. My son's is mostly viral induced but he does have backslides occasionally after activity if he had a bug recently.

You may want to look into a Pulmonologist referral from your pediatrician and considering that you're at the hospital due to an exacerbation there will likely be some motivation for her usual doctor to refer. 

A Pulmonologist will be able to determine if asthma or something else and put together a respiratory action plan to keep your kid at baseline. This will possibly be a controller medicine (taken every day to help prevent exacerbations), and a rescue medicine like albuterol for when she is showing symptoms, possibly an oral steroid as well for red stage. From what I have seen respiratory plans include 3 stages: Green for when things are going well, yellow for start of symptoms, and red in which it's now time to call a doctor or go to the ER. 

I feel you on the Nebulizer, my kid also hates it. Instead of a Nebulizer we have inhalers with a spacer chamber so medicine doesn't escape in the battle and I've found that to work better for us than the Nebulizer. I'm sorry you and your kid are going through this. Asthma sucks.(#3)Look up coughing asthma and track how much she's coughing at night. Maybe use a baby monitor if her bedrooms out of earshot. 
Nebulizer and regular prevention puffers have helped tremendously in our kids. It might be time to start adding a prevention one to your routine if you are noticing an increase in asthmatic episodes.(#4)Sounds somewhat like my son who has coughing-type asthma. Sometimes it is triggered by unknown environmental factors, other times it comes on strong when he gets a cold or other upper respiratory infection. When he's sick, he can spend days coughing almost nonstop and having chest retractions. (We have taken him to the ER or urgent care several times but his oxygen has always been okay.) We have seen a specialist who recommended giving Budesonide by nebulizer at the first sign of a cold to prevent these attacks. The doctor also prescribed an oral steroid to use sparingly when things get rough. We also have Albuterol for regular symptom relief. So we keep all of those meds on hand and use them in rotation when our son gets a flare-up. Taking action early has helped to shorten the incidents.

Sounds like it will be important to get your little one comfortable with the nebulizer. Hopefully you can find her a good book or video or other distraction. Good luck with your upcoming doctor visit and I hope they can recommend a plan. ‚ù§Ô∏è(#5)How is she doing?"
Am I ok if my blood oxygen is low but I can raise it with some deep breathing?,12,0.94,15,"(#1)Those trackers can be a bit unreliable. Get a reputable finger oximeter to confirm results.(#2)You probably should ask your doctor or at least the doctor's nurse to find out what's normal for you and at what number you need to use your inhaler. It's good you're paying close attention to this kind of thing.(#3)Fitness trackers can be very inaccurate when it comes to SpO2.

Anything over 92% is considered normal.(#4)High 80s, call EMS.(#5)I am not a doctor but this is a situation I would use my rescue inhaler for.  If I didn't see lasting improvement I'd call my doctors office or a teledoc.(#6)Forget what people say about them not being reliable. Get 2 or three well reviewed ones.. If they all say the same thing you probably have an issue. 

I just went to the doc and they gave me a steroid to breath in at the beginning and end of my day and my numbers went up and i feel a lot better as i can take full breaths when I need to. My breaths before weren't bad but now I know what a full breath is.(#7)I think you should be okay technically (assuming you use a pulse oximeter to confirm accuracy). But when I'm in the low 90s I'm pretty miserable, so I use my rescue.(#8)Below 95% is not normal and definitely worth visiting a doctor, below 92% is more or less an ER visit. 

But like ofhers mentioned get a pulse oxymeter that goes on your finger. I use both my apple watch and finger meter and they are pretty comparable in results. I‚Äôd say the apple watch seems pretty reliable. But have no clue about other fitness trackers.(#9)I‚Äôd probably call the doctor because dipping below 95/90 isn‚Äôt good and if that‚Äôs really what it is you might need supplemental oxygen."

Advice & encouragement I have developed uncontrolled asthma,5,1.0,7,"(#1)I feel so bad for you, just reading this gives me hives. First off stick with your preventative inhaler, it‚Äôs not a big deal and you need it. Use a spacer and rinse to avoid yeast infection. Secondly yes you need to control your environment to the best of your ability - you can‚Äôt go on like this. So your partner can either work with you on it or they aren‚Äôt worth sticking around for. How about asking a friend to mind the dog for a week and seeing how much it does or doesn‚Äôt help? Are allergy shots an option? Personally I know my asthma can‚Äôt withstand pets in house, we gave up a cat too, had a pet rabbit in garden instead etc. It took me forever to have the ability/means to control my living situation but now I have no carpet or curtains, no pets, run roomba every day & allergy covers on pillows & mattress. Asthma is controlled by this & singulair/symbicort and only flairs when i have a virus. Good luck- you can do it, it‚Äôs worth the sacrifices to get your asthma under control.(#2)holistic things really wouldnt do anything . i myself was diagnosed with uncontrolled asthma . got better and my symptoms are starting to worsen again as well. best thing to do is keep in contact with your specialist because they know best . anytime you need to go to the hospital or have a severe flare up let them know .(#3)Is this relationship literally killing you, making you potentially deathly ill?"
"How bad is a humid, mouldy house for asthma?",33,1.0,32,"(#1)*How bad is a humid, mouldy house for asthma?*

GET OUT OF THERE ASAP AND FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE !!

THAT PLACE IS TOXIC(#2)I wouldn‚Äôt want to stay there for 5 minutes.(#3)Pretty sure living in awful mouldy unventilated flats is what caused my adult onset asthma. Get out of there ASAP!! :((#4)It‚Äôs terrible for asthma(#5)GET THE FUUUUUUUUUU... OUT. Mould is a killer for us asthmatics.(#6)Sound advice here.
If you can't leave asap, please try to purchase or borrow an air purifier with a HEPA filter for the room where you sleep. 

Also, get a dehumidifier. I got one for my place in January and it's been really helpful for my very persistent and difficult to treat asthma. I have to dump the collected water at least once a day - 1.6 gallons of water.

Everywhere else in the house, air purifiers in each room (if feasible), open windows for a few minutes here and there to ventilate the space.(#7)It will kill you, if you live there long enough. That's how bad it is. 
I stayed with family a few years back, and there was an access panel that had been cut in the ceiling of the basement apartment. The climate here is very arid, so the moldy beams, were dry, and I told said family member that it was dangerous. He argued, of course saying it wasn't.

We only stayed with him a couple months, but that goddamned mold almost killed me. I ended up going to the ER, and my peak flow meter was at 50. Yes 50, I was gasping, and unable to talk or walk.(#8)Bad.  I lived in a house that had mold from regular flooding.  I ended up in the hospital three times (once with a 104 degree fever).  I lost my job from being out sick so much.

Avoid it like the plauge!(#9)My lungs are like Moon surface, after having asthma from 2001, I get it after 5 hours in a cold mountain stream that get me heavy pneumonia that later become asthma (and I'm allergic to mites too), some Sargent in the military thought its good idea for cadets to do. Several times asthma put me in life or death situation, it is crucial to avoid cigarette smoke or any kind of burning smoke, any irritants for lungs too, like air full of particles. Mold is big no too. I removed all carpets and any dust collectors in my home. Mix vinegar and water 1 part vinegar, 2 parts water and use that to clean your home it's the best killer for germs and mites, there is a strong acid smell but it evaporates fast. I like that method more than putting strong chemicals in home flour. I always keep one window semi-opened too so fresh air makes the moving of air in the home natural.  A dehumidifier is a good way to keep the place dry but to dry is not good for you too, so keep it in a sane amount of use. Stay strong it's a hard illness but we can make a fight and get better!(#10)It‚Äôs the worst! I lived in a moldy house for a year, and it made my asthma terrible. Now in my new place it‚Äôs much better already(#11)Mold is bad for everyone. By the time you see the mold, there is tons of mold you can't see.

If you have central AC, start running the AC to dry the air. If you do not, you will need to get dehumdifiers.(#12)Mold thrives in moisture. I‚Äôd suggest a dehumidifier and air filter if you want to stay, but I suggest moving. You might be able to get out of your contract if your landlord doesn‚Äôt address the mold problem.(#13)Bruh I‚Äôve lived in a moldy, humid apartment for almost three years now, it SUCKS. There are nights where I sit by an open window and can feel the wheeze all the way through my body. I had a mild asthma attack that lasted three days no matter what I took, I was panting nonstop, and I‚Äôm sure this apartment was no help with it. It gives me migraines, my thinking is constantly cloudy and I can‚Äôt remember things for shit anymore. You need to move out, untreated mold is considered a viable reason to break a lease in most places. Better wishes :((#14)I'm wheezing just reading this(#15)i lived in one of those basically i couldnt function . i mean i couldnt even order a pizza without coughing like crazy . my dad got mad at the landlord cause when i came to my parents house one day i woke up had a mild asthma attack and it wasnt pretty for the landlord ..(#16)lifelong suffer..... when I moved to the desert my asthma went away for a few years...  before that humidity/mold  was a huge trigger.(#17)Mold is very bad for an asthmatic. There is always mold that you can‚Äôt see so even if you get ride of the visible mold, you will still be inhaling mold spores.(#18)i got asthma from that shit. Living there for like 7 years? It got way worse, when pandemic hit as i was indoors all the time. Thankfully i am now abroad, but i am still studying, so  i gotta be here from time to time...after graduating im bailing out of there asap(#19)Remember the way your body feels when you enter a moldy space. It can be a useful warning sign in the future. Paying attention to my body saved me from renting a moldy vacation cottage once."
Breo Ellipta,0,0.5,13,"(#1)Hi! This is what I am on. I was started on these powder inhalers and was also really nervous since asthma was all new to me. It really helped call me down to read and reread the instructions and I am sure there are even videos on how to use it. The biggest thing is to keep the lid closed until you are ready to inhale so you get all the medicine. I would do something to distract yourself after so stress doesn‚Äôt cause any breathlessness. You‚Äôll want to be able to be objective to see if it helps or not so you can speak to your doctor about if this medication is working for you or not. You‚Äôll do great!(#2)I was also very nervous about taking this medication since I read up on all the potential side effects.

I was on breo elipta for about a week roughly 2.5 months ago.  It worked wonders for me - all my asthma symptoms disappeared after my first dose.  I had to stop using it however because I was getting chest and back pain, headaches and I developed tinnitus in my ear after 2 days on it which gradually grew worse the longer I took it.  The ringing in my ear is still there even after I stopped taking breo but it's not as bad as when I was on it.  

The good news is that even though I've stopped taking it my asthma symptoms are still dramatically reduced.  I don't have wheezing anymore and I only use my rescue inhaler once or twice a month.  Time will only tell if this temporary though.(#3)I refuse to use a nebulizer for years. I hate them and I swear some of them make me worse. I tried symbicort it was really good and then I was forced to switch to brio because of insurance reasons.  I LOVE BREO!!! Just try it once and if it's not for you don't try it again but it does take a little bit of time to get into your system so I would say give it a week and see how you feel. Honestly I don't think you have anything to fear here and I say that as somebody who had panic attacks daily and weekly for about 5 years so I understand the fear that you're in. In fact don't hesitate to message me and let me know how it went, I'm rooting for you!(#4)Using Breo daily for extended period. Keeps me breathing free. No side effects. Use first thing in the morning always rinse mouth thoroughly. Great product.(#5)Honestly, I don't remember having any side effects from it, but I do remember how uncomfortable the powder felt in my throat each time. Make sure you rinse your mouth and gargle to get the powder out, because you run the risk of getting oral thrush otherwise.(#6)Why do you have fear? It's a simple inhalation.(#7)I‚Äôm on it and it has really worked no more asthma attacks! Some side effects but working those out mostly hoarse voice."
7yo asthmatic son has intense headcolds that lead to several days of sleepless nights,6,1.0,11,"(#1)For the pillow situation I use a pillow wedge. I just recently bought one and it was a game changer.(#2)I have these same issues. 
Cutting down on  dust collectors, like carpet, rugs and fabric curtains, using bedding that can easily and frequently be washed (and a mattress cover that keeps dust/mites off/out), changing heater filter regularly and with a high quality filter, get your ducts cleaned. 
A wedge pillow like someone else mentioned. 
Your steam showers are a big help because it helps to loosen the mucus in lungs and sinuses. 
Not sure when he‚Äôll be old enough but you can use Affrin for 3 nights during his worst time to help him sleep. 
If you live on a dirt road, have animals in the house, or lots of animal dander, try to manage the amount in his sleeping environment. I slept much better during my colds after I moved to college and lived on a paved road, lots of trees, no carpet and all that. Helped me shape what I needed in my living environment and it‚Äôs under control to the point that I can have a dog.(#3)Night time can be hell for asthma. Agreed, try getting a wedge pillow. When youre asthmatic and have flair ups, sleeping flat can feel like you‚Äôre suffocating. Also, when he has congestion in his lungs, pounding his back with a cupped hand can help loosen the phlegm so he can cough it out.(#4)Try vitamin D supplements. I used to be like this until I started taking vitamin D, and now my colds are more normal. Lots of science to back it up, with both respiratory colds and asthma.(#5)Ask his doctor, but I increase my inhaled steroids when anybody in the family has a sniffle. I have a history of catching a bug that gave Spouse and Kiddo a runny nose for 48 hours and spending two weeks in the hospital.(#6)My son and I have asthma and mast cell activation disorder (MCAD). Mast cell disorders can cause a person with a garden variety colds and other viruses or bacterial infections to take much longer to recover from than those who don't have them. Some. With MCAD 'leak' histamine (i.e. take longer to recover from viruses, histamine keeps them awake at night) and others go into anaphylaxis frequently (aka. 'shockers') 

People with mast cell disorders almost always have negative scratch tests. This is because it's highly dependent on how full their 'histamine buckets' are on any given day. What fills said bucket can be anything environmental: virus, pollen, stress, excitement, dust mites, vaccine immune response, mold, leftover food (histamine doubles if not frozen), aged cheeses, and more. 

Also, the body's circadian rhythm dumps histamine at night which might be why he's having sleepless nights. If memory serves correctly, it's around 11pm and 5am. So, maybe, Children's Benedryl might be helpful to clear the added histamine load the virus is creating.

Also, if pollen has started doing its thing in your area, antihistamines can be a good defense mechanism while he's sick. The major ones like Claritin, Allegra, and Zyrtec each have different active ingresoent,which can be taken together. Famotidine (Zantac) is a gut histamine blocker & antacid. Zyrtec causes sleepiness and works for 24 hours.

It might be worth a try having him on Zyrtec & Zantac through the course of his virus. If they help, it might be worth considering a histamine disorder with his doctor."
Class Project,1,0.6,0,
Dyspnea?,27,0.97,22,"(#1)Yes, this is something I've experienced. 

First off, please go see your doctor. Whilst dyspnea can be a symptom of asthma, it can also be caused by other lung issues or heart problems (including long Covid). If your doctor concludes that it is asthma,  then your asthma likely isn't sufficiently well-controlled or you have issues with atopic triggers and they may need to tweak your medications. 

In the meantime, if it happens again, take your reliever inhaler.(#2)I get this often. I‚Äôve noticed that i can sometimes get relief with antacids. 

It gets worse the more i focus on it and can lead to anxiety.(#3)I do not have asthma, but I have shortness of breath and never could find a diagnosis nor a fix. Been taking inhalers for months with very little help. My last doctor told me to get off symbicort and told me an interesting technique of controlling my breath. He noticed i was sighing a lot looking for a breath, also yawning but no air was getting through, so instead he told me whenever i look for those deep breaths to resist that urge and hold ur breath for a while then return to ur normal breathing pattern to stabilize the pacing and urges. It did help me a bit, although sometimes there is a learning curve, worked better with time. U cant really die from holding ur breath, ur body wont let u and it can help u stabilize breathing patterns if u hyperventilate or for some reason have urges to take deep breaths despite having enough oxygen in ur body.  
  
Of course if you are worried and feel badly I encourage seeing a doctor or going to the ER if things escalate; dont take it as a medical advice.

&#x200B;

What seems to be the reason behind my dyspnea might be either LPR or h. pylori, according to a lot of research and trying different medication.(#4)I get this constantly. Spoke to two docs have checked pulse ox and peak flow( always normal) this is caused by anxiety, reflux, bloating or all the above(#5)Dyspnea is one of my diagnoses given by my pulmonologist alongside asthma. I get it when I exercise too hard or go out in extreme weather.(#6)The same happens to me! Nothing stops it, and my doctors don‚Äôt really know how to help me. Now a part of my rib is loose, I think it‚Äôs because of all this weird breathing(#7)Not sure if this will be relevant to you but I‚Äôve had this since I was a kid and only now accepted that it is primarily anxiety based (for me at least), I also experience incomplete yawns but if I focus on relaxing I‚Äôm able to get a full one in. Anyway, just my 2 cents."
Asthma with ABPA any one here,0,0.5,0,
Does anyone here use lung exercisers?,5,1.0,5,(#1)I use a Power Breathe.
misdiagnosis of asthma,5,0.86,9,"(#1)I've heard that asthma can have no symptoms whatsoever especially during growing up period.

I don't really have asthmatic friends so can only speak from personal experience.  


Been diagnosed with asthma when I was little, don't even remember how little.   
Most of my teen years were great, never took inhalers, didn't care.  
Felt like I don't have it, especially cause I was never bad at sports, not great either but like top 5 in a group of 20.  


I always thought, ""who is sick, me? no way""  
I hated thinking about myself as ""sick"".   
My pride didn't let me  


Now I'm in my late 20's and it's worsening. It's not like I'm wheezing or suffocating all the time, but it is noticeable . Doc said it probably wouldn't have happened if I took my meds. I didn't cause I felt great most of the time.   


I'm writing this cause your post sounds kinda like my past self speaking.  


Maybe it would get worse anyway, and doc said it cause there was nothing else to say, who knows.   


I'd still trust doctors. You could ask your parents to go visit different doc and have spirometry done or other tests if you are unsure.  


Even if you are feeling healthy, doesn't mean you are not asthmatic. And being asthmatic doesn't make you handicapped. Some have it worse, some have it better.(#2)Asthma can go into remission. I was a wheeze free teen up until I got pregnant at 25. Asthma attacks galore.(#3)I dont have wheezing (never had it) and was also able to run marathons, but I cough a lot to the point were sometimes I gag/vomit. I was diagnosed with mild asthma. Then when my pulmonologist was on vacation, the covering pulmo ordered a PFT(pulmonary function test) and based on the results and since I dont have the classic asthma symptoms, he said I have Reactive airway disease.
Also both conditions can go into remission.(#4)Speak to your doctor. The problem is there is no definitive test for asthma. Doctors usually go on symptoms and see if inhalers help. If you don't feel the inhalers do anything or you don't need them then it's probable they will say you don't have asthma now. However they won't go back and say you never had it they'll probably just say you had childhood asthma and grew out of it."
NyQuil with asthma?,2,0.76,2,"(#1)My doc always recommends Mucinex if I get sick. He says it does a much better job than NyQuil.(#2)There is virtually nothing that will make your symptoms improve, especially cough. Bronchitis is an understated evil bitch.  The only thing that might help is some codeine cough syrup from the doctor.

Take ibuprofen, drink lots of water, only take mucinex when you will be sitting up for 4 hours. Nyquil might help you sleep.

See a doc for some antibiotics. Don't smoke or vape. 

Many well wishes."
One way to cause panic at an asthma check in with your GP: :D,35,0.97,5,"(#1)Back in elementary school my school nurse banned me from having blue raspberry blow pops. My lips were always blue and she kept freaking out haha.(#2)Haha, well atleast that assures your GP cares about the smaller details!(#3)Lmao hello fellow asthmatic fountain pen user. Please tell me it is baystate blue that did the staining.(#4)THAT, is funny. üòÜ"
"Asthma flared over 3 weeks, puffers not working",11,1.0,22,"(#1)So pleased to read your escalating treatment. This has clearly gone beyond what you normally deal with.

I have never used Bleo Elipta. This is obviously prescribed as a stronger treatment.

Relating my own experience, you a borderline hospital case right now, if you are struggling to take a full breath.

If you feel you are getting any worse, please don't hesitate to call an ambulance and get to hospital.

TBH, if you have been deteriorating over that past 3 weeks, I'd probably go to hospital.

Take care.(#2)Ipratropium bromide.  Might help.  Relaxes the muscles.  Without knowing what was tried.  You need to speak with a doctor.  High stress and anxiety can cause exasterbation.(#3)Do you have any wheezing while breathing or is it just a tight feeling like you're out of breath the whole time?(#4)In the past I have had luck with Breo Ellipta when a steroid alone wasn‚Äôt enough. For me this was usually it was seasonal allergy or chronic anxiety triggered. It‚Äôs definitely worth a shot. 

You didn‚Äôt mention if you have a pulmonologist but I highly recommend a visit given the sudden change, if finances allow. I spent over a year puttering around with my GP with medication adjustments and trying to wait out a big change to my mild asthma . After much delay I saw a Pulmonologist who helped shed light on my new (post Covid infection) situation. It‚Äôs still a work in progress but at least there‚Äôs been progress.(#5)I feel you, the same happened to me twice since 2022 (long flare ups, like 2 weeks at a time)(#6)Antibiotics? Reactive airway with a sinus infection??"
"Super wheezy, bad cold-like symptoms",3,1.0,2,(#1)I would go see a different doctor. Sounds like a respiratory infection. If not treated can go very south
Mucus post albuterol,12,1.0,4,"(#1)That's how I know my rescue inhaler is working, all that stuff is loosened enough to come out.

The first time I took symbicort, I coughed up (tmi warning, it's gross) stuff that looked like spaghetti noodles, which I read is the mucus lining the passages in the lungs. The loose stuff that comes up when I take albuterol isn't nearly as disturbing to me for some reason.(#2)Asthma causes your airway to produce a lot of sticky gross mucus, and because your airway is also becoming inflamed you can't get that mucus out very well. When you use your rescue inhaler that Albuterol relaxes the muscles and allows the mucus to flow. So it's doing what it should, cough that mucus out.(#3)Feature, not a bug, unfortunately. If you're coughing that much, it's because your lungs weren't able to get the phlegm up before, and are trying to clear it out. You might have an easier time of it if you take a Mucinex beforehand, that would help thin/loosen it up(#4)I didn‚Äôt realize this, thank you, I thought it was the meds irritating me."
"New to asthma, important question",12,0.93,29,"(#1)Maintenance inhaler(#2)Yep, that‚Äôs asthma. 

What you need to do is work with a doctor (ideally pulmonologist) on what‚Äôs called an Asthma Action Plan, which is basically what you need to do to appropriately control your asthma. 

For most people, this is a combination of ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù procedures (stuff you do every day to mitigate/manage your asthma) and ‚Äúrescue‚Äù procedures (stuff you do when you have an attack). The balance should be such that your maintenance routine makes it so you only need to use rescue medications infrequently, like every few weeks or less. 

Maintenance is a combination of medications like montelukast/singulair, maintenance inhalers, and identifying triggers and treating them (for example allergic asthma could be treated with antihistamines or allergy shots; exercise-induced asthma could be addressed by extra medication before you exercise, etc.)

Rescue is usually an inhaler and/or nebulizer that you use when you get symptoms beyond your baseline. This is where you should work with a doctor to know how to measure a good baseline, using stuff like a peak flow meter, pulse oximeter, or just how you‚Äôre physically feeling. And if you go outside of normal ranges you would use the rescue medication to feel better. 

Ideally your doctor could help you form this all into a reference sheet you can post on your fridge or wherever, until you get a good enough handle on it yourself (over time most asthmatics just handle their asthma like second nature).(#3)Asthma makes it hard to exhale. Problems inhaling usually only comes when you can't get anymore air into your lungs because of air trapping. Then you would have major problems inhaling and exhaling.(#4)This sounds like Dyspnea, a symptom of both asthma and anxiety - I mention the latter as the two can be closely linked and they have similar symptoms and one can make the other worse etc.
Try to identify at which time you get the feeling and if so, either remove yourself from the situation and try a breathing technique to remind your brain that you are getting enough oxygen or ask your doctor to look into it's cause.
I've mentioned it to my doctor and she said it was quite common with people with asthma, but Ive not accepted this as an answer so I'm pushing for more(#5)Definitely recommend seeing a Pulmonologist and getting an asthma action plan. Relying only on your rescue inhaler isn‚Äôt ideal because you aren‚Äôt managing the inflammation asthma causes. I was in the same boat, got mild asthma from a bout with covid in early 2020. I didn‚Äôt use a maintenance inhaler until this Fall all the sudden I couldn‚Äôt breath. I had to do a round of steroids plus symbicort and spiriva and even with all that was horribly short of breath for two weeks. I never wanted to experience that again so I started taking it seriously. 

I also use a peak flow meter to monitor and if it is lower than my baseline, I know to start the spiriva or nebulizer. 

Best of luck! It is crappy but well controlled asthma is so much better! Most days I don‚Äôt have any issues. :)(#6)I have the same symptom sometimes. It means that there is a little leftover air in your lungs, so you can‚Äôt get fresh air to replace it. If something triggers your asthma symptoms get worse. Triggers can be: exercise, allergies, dust, being sick, humidity- or temperature of air, even smells or just a good laugh. It‚Äôs different for everyone. If the shortness of breath occurs but goes away, that means something triggered your asthma a little, but maybe it stopped. Like you do a little exercise, and you feel a little short of breath, but you rest a little and you get better. It can be the same with any other trigger. But sometimes the symptoms aren‚Äôt stopping even if the trigger stops, or maybe the trigger doesn‚Äôt stops at all. That‚Äôs the time you need to use your emergency inhaler. (Usually albuterol, blue or red) If you know, that your asthma is triggered by exercise, you can even prevent the symptoms, by using your inhaler before exercising. It‚Äôs okay to to that. But other than that If you feel like you need to use your emergency inhaler more than 2-3 times a week, or you feel it‚Äôs not helping even after about 10 minutes, you need to call your doctor, because you might need new medication.

Edit: emergency aka rescue inhaler. Sorry don‚Äôt wanted to write anything confusing.(#7)This could be anxiety, not asthma, especially where you say it goes away without needing the inhaler.(#8)Have you talked to your doctor about anxiety?(#9)Have someone cup their hands, thumb to the side while you lay down shirt off, they bring their hand up shoulder high while popping you over you rib areas with their hands, not much strength is needed but continue in the area the lungs ü´Å are and do not hit the ends of the ribs, do not hit the spine, this should happen for 10 minutes a session with a brief rundown afterwards with some oil on your back.  You should be sore after, but able to cough up anything in your lungs.  Look on you tube for Percussion treatment.  10 minutes 5 times a day, then as your issues abate 3 x a day.

We Will, We Will Beat You, Sing it !

If by your doing really bad a 30 minute session can be done but you will really be sore

An albuterol treatment after is ideal with a nebulizer.  Only 3x for albuterol treatment a day if I seem to remember.  And I was beaten plenty.(#10)I yawn a lot when I feel that way ...helps get a big deep breath in and it feels better for a little bit."
26 and just found out in asthmatic.,12,0.88,5,"(#1)Same.....35 and got covid mid 2020.  That was an experience especially since we didn't know that much about it at the time.  I battled it for about three weeks, however it really messed up my lungs.  I still struggle to take my dogs out for their potty walk. Finally after a year, my new PC diagnosed me with asthma...something I also grew out of as a child.    


It SUCKS!(#2)Very similar thing happened to me(#3)Have you seen an ENT?(#4)You don't ""grow out"" of asthma... That's just not how that works. Some people just learn to deal with symptoms, others just experience fewer symptoms, especially because kids get a lot of viral infections. 

You were just asymptomatic until the COVID caused problems. 

Definitely need a ENT evaluation if you're having that much sinusitis deals. In the mean time, try the neti pot squeeze bottle type thing. Make sure to use distilled water or water that's been boiled and cooled. Basically follow the directions on the box, so you don't get another type of infection. Azelastine and budesonide make a good combination and I get them both compounded and put in my netipot. 

The burning pain in your chest is not a good deal. That's a hallmark symptom of asthma. You need to have evaluated. 

If you start wheezing, coughing hard, have severe chest or shortness of breath, seek medical attention immediately. 

You need to get a rescue med on hand ASAP. You also may need to get a controller inhaler, especially until your sinuses can be fixed. 

I had to have sinus surgery and move from a moldy apartment to get my asthma under control. It kinda sucks, but there's good meds out, better stuff than when we were little (I'm the same age). 

Good luck! You can get it under control."
Is it Asthma ?,2,1.0,7,"(#1)Half the time they have no clue. I have asthma, and you would think that after 30 years of having it, doctors would have found something to help me control it better. No luck. Just a lot of bureaucracy and trial and error. More error than trial though."

So I had to switch to my back but I always felt like I was suffocating on my back. So I got a bed wedge that lifts my mattress that I'm not laid flat. Try putting a rolled up duvet or a few pillows under your mattress so it's slightly lifted it might help. When I first switched I'd put a pillow either side to stop me rolling over it kind of worked but sometimes I woke up on my side snuggling the pillow!!  It took a while to get used to but i can now fall asleep on my back still occasionally wake up on my side though.(#2)It's weird, but I can't sleep on my stomach and I'm not so good sleeping on my back because I gag on mucus that is constantly flowing down the back of my throat.

Sleeping on my side right or left are my only options. I do, however, have to have my arm under my pillow. The ""upper"" arm supported in some way as to not put pressure on my chest.

I also have a small, USB-powered fan, that blows air on my face and keeps me cool. This also aids in my breathing as well as sleep. It is something that works for me. And as we all know, you do what you have to do, to make things as easy and as comfortable as possible.

I think, one main issue is the variety of asthma sufferers.

But, and here is where the problems arise, they try to compare, and severe asthma and cough variant asthma are non-comparable. Yes, it is great that you have never missed a day at work, but it won't work for me. Exercise won't cure me, but can kill me if things go wrong.

I also have chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis which required me to be on Prednisolone for two nine month blocks starting at 50mg, and tapering off down to 0mg. The first block failed and I had to do it again. Whilst I'm now in sarcoid remission, the damage is done.

I put on a LOT of weight. The main thing is, it is mostly all fluid. Once you start tapering off the Prednisolone, you will be running to the toilet, pissing out the accumulated fluid.

As to those who say ""Well Just Exercise"" - It goes to their frigging ignorance. It is disappointing though, when it comes from family members who should know better. I get that from my family, despite trying to explain my health problems.

I fully empathise with your situation.

Especially when its tour own family members, who have worse asthma than you but just don't like to show any weakness whatsoever by voicing what ails them. Or yes, telling you that being ""extra active"" has greatly improved their asthma which is worse than yours. Huh. Guess they are luckier than I am then! If I smell something that's too strong/oily, can be as injocient as cooling steam, that'll make me wheezy. Or a bad cold will make me sound like a super wheezy OAP. No sympathy, fine. But its the worst when ppl make you feel like a liar because they're don't suffer like you do, and think you're just being ""fragile"".(#10)i had a bad asthma flare last year my mom was like if you ate better you wouldnt be so sick lol .(#11)Any of you had breathing issues triggered by wearing a mask, and then had a Karen mid Asthma attack berate you for being an anti-masker? Or is that just happening in canada(#12)Love the post. By the way if you‚Äôre interested in finding other sources of help there are clinical studies for asthma. This is my referral link https://www.withpower.com/go/tevb/clinical-trials/asthma?referralBonus=Kerekhegykn"
Of fucking course,12,0.88,7,"(#1)I see you live in San Antonio. I live in Arizona. Trelegy in the same packaging, brand name, costs $40 in Los Algodones, Mexico. That‚Äôs less than my insurance copay of $160 each. 

Trelegy is the one medication that makes me not need my rescue inhaler at all.(#2)If it's the only one that works for you, your doctor's office can work on getting insurance to cover it. I've had to do that before when I was allergic to the covered med.

Getting it from Mexico like someone suggested isn't a bad idea either, one of my neighbors used to go every couple of months. We're on the far west side of San Antonio and she said it was less than 2 hours to get there.(#3)Brio worked for me, but to really clear and completely stop any symptoms it took almost 2 years taking it.(#4)I get Brio it helps quite a bit, I have a relative on disability who just gets it for me from their doctor because $$$üî•(#5)Check the manufacturer‚Äôs website.   They often offer huge discounts if you can‚Äôt afford it otherwise.(#6)I love Trelegy but even with the manufacturers discount it‚Äôs 200 a month for me(#7)This concurs with what you say.

*Bottom Line. One alternative to the Trelegy Ellipta triple therapy inhaler would be to combine the use of two separate inhalers - Breo Ellipta (fluticasone/vilanterol) and Incruse Ellipta (umeclidinium). You would also need to keep a fast-acting inhaler, such as albuterol, close by for sudden symptoms.*

So, because this medication is for COPD and your using for asthma, then it is classed as using it off-label, hence it's not covered by your insurance, am I right?

Can you try to get your asthma classified as COPD by your doctor? Because that is essentially what it is."
What works better,5,1.0,1,"(#1)There is no difference beyond being made by 2 different companies.

If you are using the rescue inhaler more than 2-3 times a week, please talk to your doctor about adjusting your controller med."
It's exhausting and I just want to scream,31,0.94,22,"(#1)heck youre not being a baby at all . youre on this sub because youre suffering and people here have experienced as well . its not fun at all . all of us here understand what youre going thru .(#2)I feel you! Maintaining a condition like this is like having another full time job. It's ok to be upset about it when you need to. It sucks.(#3)You may need to change doctors and find one that is going to get you on the correct controller meds. Once you are on the correct meds, you should not need to spend months on oral prednisone.(#4)*Sorry for being such a baby about it*

No, you're not being a baby, Ma'am.

You have been overwhelmed by circumstances and right now you're highly stressed. Completely understandable.

I have been in a similar state of mind on several occasions. Nothing goes right, you are struggling and you seem to be stuck with no way out.

I just hope you are in a safe place right now.(#5)I hope you fare better days soon.
I had to leave my school football team due to asthma and it was a very painful decision.(#6)As other posters have said, you are most definitely not being a baby! Vent away! We all need to do that sometimes. 

Also, as someone who has been there, done that and got the t-shirt, my suggestion is to get a second or third opinion. I spent more time in hospital than I did out of the hospital the year I was 21. When I was 19 - 22 were the worst years of my asthma. 

My respiratory specialist admitted that he didn't know everything and consulted with other doctors because I was on mega doses of steroids and had been on Prednisone since I was 10. (u/buzzybnz was in the same boat. We're twins, it happens) The year I was 21, I spent more time in hospital than out of the hospital. 

I wish I could say that everything got magically better and is perfect now, but it's not. I'm still a severe chronic asthmatic 20 years later.  However, I haven't been admitted to the hospital for my asthma for 9 years. 3 1/2 years ago I started the Nucala injections and went from using my Ventolin inhaler 10+ times a day to 2 - 4 times a day.(#7)This is totally the place to complain! It sucks ass big time. I‚Äôve had asthma since I was 2 and have no idea how it must feel to simply be able to breathe and never fear not being able to breathe. I end up on the prednisone a lot too and it‚Äôs amazing stuff but it‚Äôs also utterly awful. 

A couple of years ago I went to my very nice doctor and said to him that I was starting to have panic attacks about my asthma and that the panic attacks were then triggering the asthma. He said the most validating thing anyone has ever said to me about it. He said, ‚ÄòOf course you‚Äôre having panic attacks, asthma is terrifying.‚Äô

So come here and complain all you want. We all totally get it. It is terrifying and it‚Äôs absolutely not fair. Xx(#8)that last bit, i felt it so deeply. i empathize with you and i know first hand the pain and struggle. every day is like a battle and we have to almost re train our body to breathe all over again. it‚Äôs hard to sleep at night sometimes and during the day it all just feels like an attack could come on at any second if you‚Äôre not careful and all that just adds on the stress. 

you‚Äôre not a baby for feeling that way. i used to feel guilty of complaining or asking for the help that i need because i felt that someone else has it worse, but then i realized that this is my life and the pain that i‚Äôm enduring is real and i should not have to apologize for any of that.(#9)Welcome to the club, here you will learn alot about how to mitigate this illness and work arounds to make your life better. Trust me i lost faith on doctors, even my 3 maternal uncles are doctors. But i still live with asthma and joining these forms I learned that i can run with inhaler which i was not told by doctors before(#10)You hang in there and vent all you want! That is what this is for! Learning and bearing one another‚Äôs burdens alike! You are not alone as crazy as it sounds and even if it pisses you off, someone has it even worse than this. And that sucks to hear because this is your worst and it makes you panicked and it is scary I understand! However, it will get better! Reminding myself on my worse days that someone else has it worse oddly made me push harder to live another day (on my worst days). It humbled me‚Ä¶ then again that may not work for others and that‚Äôs ok. There isn‚Äôt one right way. Sometimes just hearing it will be ok. Or that this too shall pass don‚Äôt hang up your hat here! Better days are coming and you hang onto that thought! It‚Äôs coming and you will be relieved and deserving of it! In the meantime get a better doctor that puts you on top priority! It is you paying them after all. And you deserve better attention! It‚Äôs no joke! Chin up! It‚Äôs going to be ok! And be a baby all you want! It‚Äôs damn validated that‚Äôs for sure! Hang in there please!"
Why do powders work better than the HFA for some people and is the HFA controllers more likely to cause thrush ? Does the HFA go deeper into the smaller airways ?,8,1.0,3,(#1)Hfa inhalers make me gag. I use a powder and it works alright.
bf having nocturnal asthma at my place,11,1.0,28,"(#1)He needs to go to a pulmonology or allergy specialist and they can determine what is causing his issues and the best treatment options. 

Also, a couple of thoughts he should consider discussing with his doctor(s) based off your comments:
- a common trigger for night time asthma is actually acid reflux or GERD. He should be evaluated to make sure that isn't what is triggering 
- he should also have sleep apnea ruled out(#2)Do people in your area burn wood to stay warm? If so, your heater could be pulling in smoke at night. Other than that, you may need to rehome the cat. My partner had to find a new family for his cat because of me. It was so sad, but she loves her new family and I can breathe now.(#3)Is there a cover on the litter box? My ex was allergic to cats and I saw his allergies flare up upon adopting a cat however this was on the first few days when I had an uncovered litter box. As soon as I got a new one with a lid (and door flap) on it his allergies seemed to have gone away completely. My theory is that the pheromones/ammonia in cat urine wasn‚Äôt being contained and was in the air and causing the flare ups. Just a thought‚Ä¶you might have a cover on yours in that case just disregard this. I hope you find something that helps! maybe try vacuuming/steaming your mattress if the cat used to sleep on it? Maybe it‚Äôs lingering dander?(#4)I have some simple things to add which might be easy to rule out, but maybe it helps\_

1. Have you tried pillow cases? They are available for the mattress and the blanket. As soon as you unpack the new ones, the dust starts to settle. Using the cases helped a lot.
2. Do you have carpets next to your bed or pillows in your bed? Removing them made my asthma way better.
3. Could it be heartburn? It can cause the most annoying asthma symptoms, at least for my granny, so maybe it is the dinner, not the night?
4. There is a link between a sleep hormone and asthma. Does he take sleeping pills? They might worsen the situation.(#5)Has he tried taking antihistamines prior to coming to your place?

Personally it sounds like my symptoms when sleeping over people's homes with cats and I'm allergic. 

Depending on your circumstances I'd recommend getting the cat rehomed and deep cleaning the home as a last resort.(#6)He should take allergy pills.  Over time he may get used to the cat and can stop taking them.(#7)Dust, mold, cats or even weather could all be a problem. Try to figure out what causes it so you can take precautions.(#8)What is nocturnal asthma? Has he been to a doctor?(#9)He should probably see an asthma/allergy/immunologist. They can test him for allergies, determine if he's asthmatic and get him feeling better.(#10)This is terrible. I had a bad bout of nighttime asthma last year. I was completely sleep deprived. It developed into normal daytime asthma over time and I was able to start figuring out my triggers. Your bf needs to see a doc and maybe do a course of prednisolone.(#11)Test for black mold(#12)Probably the cat(s)"
Teeth problems,6,1.0,15,"(#1)Yes After over 30 years using inhalers my teeth are in bad shape. They still seem to deny that steroid inhalers can cause problems but I have all the signs that I'm not absorbing calcium. My teeth were just crumbling and my nails were paper thin despite having enough calcium in my bloodstream.

I started taking calcium tablets (they also have magnesium and vitamin d to help absorption) and it's definitely helped slow down the progression of my dental problems.(#2)Is from The albuterol.  When you use your inhaler, rinse your cold water mouth then after about half an hour, brush your teeth.  The albuterol softens the enamel on your teeth(#3)F(#4)If you don't brush and rinse every time after using the inhalers, over time, it damages tooth enamel.

You need to go to a dentist asap if you have constant tooth pain and they are breaking.(#5)WTF, im 40, still have mild asthma (sports induced asthma) my teeth are bad for the longest time and now my gyms hurt most of the time and bleed whenever i brush. 

Damnit, never knew that asthma would have cause it. Although, i have Gerd too and i was under the impression that my stomach acid messed my teeth(#6)After a year of asthma meds I had many cavities!"
Do you find your ability to exercise or walk up big hills is less than before you got diagnosed with asthma ? even though you are on the controller meds,11,0.92,21,"(#1)I used to until I started following a regular cardio program. I am almost 60 now and a severe asthmatic. I'm also in better shape now than I was when I was 30. At 55, I ran my first half marathon (21km) and finished in the top 30% for my gender.

Exercise is as much about mental stamina as physical stamina. It's also about believing you can do something.(#2)with my hills werent a problem , id never get out of breath id get more of a coughing fit kinda thing with wheezing but now if if my asthmas okay its just out of breath but if my asthmas real bad i get literally a whole flare up(#3)For me, it's a mental game. I was diagnosed with asthma as an adult - was playing football 3 times a week, gym, hiked. After they told me, whenever I exercise, its like a mental hurdle. Went for a walk the other day, hilly, in a forest. Had to stop 3 times because I thought I couldn't breathe, but in actual fact, it's just me overthinking. I don't believe in my ability to do things anymore and it's kinda sad tbh. I'm on control inhalers, 2 times a day, with nose steroids too and yet, I still panic and worry. Maybe you're fighting a mental battle too with it?
The more you do it, the easier it should get - but don't run before you can walk üòâ take it easy, take it slow and take the time to build up(#4)There‚Äôs a difference between having low stamina from being out of shape, and low stamina from asthma. It‚Äôs hard to tell the difference until you start exercising more and can feel that certain aspects of your breathing get better, and other aspects do not. For many people with asthma, it can be scary to push ourselves physically once we know we have asthma, or when our asthma is doing poorly, so sometimes we start getting in worse shape. If you want to do more cardio, I recommend a couch to 5k app (see for example r/c25k), use your rescue inhaler before starting the run, and do the jog intervals as slowly as you can without dropping down into a walk.(#5)Yes! So I have Neutrophilic asthma which is different than allergy asthma. It causes a decrease in quality of life. Over the last 5 years I‚Äôve gone from being able to move around freely to now have to stop going up stairs and avoid inclines. I get out of breathe easily and if I do not stop myself I‚Äôll have an attack.(#6)I struggle sometimes as well. I do a lot of sports, especially runnig und horse riding, but it is an issue for me. Sometimes it is just fine, sometimes it is a nightmare. The more you train (responsibly, of course), the better you will get. Do not let this stop you, but take care to train without pushing your limits too much. Ask your doctor about using your rescue medication before working out, sometimes it makes things easier.(#7)If I have an asthma attack while going up a hill then yes, if i don't then no. As in, if my bronchioles are closing and I'm wheezing then I'll certainly be affected. But often times that happens in the beginning of a run and after some inhaler puffs and 5-10 minutes the wheezing will go away and I'll get back to normal. Once I'm back to normal then asthma is no longer a factor and my ability to continue running has everything to do with conditioning.


I will say that it can be demoralizing to try to increase your stamina when you constantly get asthma, but it's still possible(#8)For me that‚Äôs the opposite, I always surprise myself not dying after running for the bus, or walking upstairs. Sometimes I still need to use my albuterol, but usually I‚Äôm way better than I was before I started to use my maintenance inhaler.(#9)I do, its irritating"
"Is there an asthma medicine that does not make one gain weight, so no steroids. I also can‚Äôt take Singulair. Anything new?",27,0.83,86,"(#1)Inhaled steroids (many types of inhalers) will not cause weight gain(#2)Spiriva? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a steroid.(#3)Hahaha we wish(#4)I'm not going to address the weight thing because you seem pretty set on your answer, but:

you state you ""used a rescue inhaler about one a year, now I‚Äôm going through one a month minimum"" AND that you ""I barely take one puff"" of your preventer inhaler. 

Going through a rescue inhaler in a single month is a sign your asthma is NOT under control. You said you're on symbicort, and the usual dose (of course, follow your doctor's instructions!) is typically something like ""two puffs twice a day"" not ""barely one puff."" 

If you're underdosing because of fear of weight gain, you really need to be talking to your doctor about it and not risking your life by not taking your meds. 

If you're taking it as instructed, you need to be working with your doctor to get your asthma better under control. Unfortunately, there's no magic trick that makes you not need steroids, and a lot of additional treatments are only added when you've maxed out inhaled steroids.(#5)Have you checked your thyroid? Not only TSH but antibodies and everything.

I had some weird things happening to me and I thought it was because of my asthma ICS but it turned out I had beginning stage of Hashimoto's that wasn't diagnosed.

Luckily I don't have to take replacement hormones yet but I do have to take vitamins and change my lifestyle to support my thyroid as much as I can.(#6)I have the same thing happen to me, unfortunately. I have PCOS, which was under control my whole life until I got asthma. My asthma is really bad and I'm under the highest possible dose of my steroid inhaler. 

When I lower the steroid dose, the weight immediately comes off. When I raise the dose, it's immediately back. It sucks. 

Steroid inhalers CAN cause weight gain when someone has a hormonal imbalance.(#7)Montelukast isn't a steroid I guess but it might make you want to kill yourself white literally(#8)Never gained weight from inhaled steroids.(#9)ICS does NOT cause weight gain. I've been on just about every ICS in the last 20+ years and have not seen any weight gain on any of them.

Weight gain in asthmatics usually happens as a side effect of not believing they can exercise anymore while still eating the same number of calories.(#10)I‚Äôm on flixotide and it so far is the only one that doesn‚Äôt give me side effects.(#11)I want to share something I learned after many years of battling weight gain related to steroids‚Ä¶

Steroids do not cause weight gain. 

Steroids cause increased appetite. 

Once I understood this fact, I was able to adjust my my daily schedule and be more mindful about my caloric intake. I am still trying to lose the weight I gained when taking oral steroids on a frequent basis. I truly wish someone had explained the difference early on, before I experienced such a significant weight gain. 

I spent a long time being resistant to my doctor‚Äôs recommendations that involved steroids. When I should‚Äôve been trying to figure out how to manage my appetite changes‚Ä¶

I hope this helps. Best wishes on your journey.(#12)I've been losing weight while I'm on xolair.(#13)I take incruse ellipta and it does not cause weight gain. It is a longer lasting bronchodilator for daily maintenance but I think it suppresses appetite like albuterol does. I also think something like advair sort of balances out because one of the components suppresses appetite while the other is a steroid with the potential for increased appetite. Singular causes increase in appetite for me, or it did, but I think it is mostly balanced out by the other drugs I take. I was able to lose close to 40 lbs since the beginning of 2020, and for a good portion of that time I‚Äôve been taking singulair. I have both lost weight and maintained while taking it.(#14)Nebulized cromolyn sodium
Ketotifen (not covered by US insurance but very effective antihistamine that‚Äôs also used for asthma)(#15)What about immune related meds like Dupixient or Xolair?(#16)Does any steroid inhalers for asthma make you gain weight?(#17)Op, I don't know why people are being dicks and down voting your responses. 
I am on 3 different inhalers a day. I've been since I had covid in December 2020. I was not very active before, and I'm not now. I have gained 50 lbs since using these inhalers. 

Just because some of you don't get that as a side effect, doesn't mean we don't."
Are there any tamper resistant fire alarms that exist? (I'm asthmatic and exposed to cigarette smoke frequently),8,0.91,3,"(#1)If you‚Äôre not using a KN95 or equivalent mask, give those a try. Cloth masks and surgical masks do nothing for my allergies or asthma, as more than enough particles I‚Äôm allergic to get in through the fabric or around the sides.(#2)Unfortunately there's no easy solution to this as all fire alarms have to be changed (assuming there's a tamper-resistant version). You should always carry a Ventolin inhaler with you in case you have an asthma attack. If your job does more harm than good then I'd say you should find work someplace else."
Anyone prescribed Tezspire yet?,4,1.0,11,"(#1)I'm getting mine hopefully this week! Waiting for it show up at my doctor. It sounds like it'll be really helpful.(#2)My insurance declined it, so we‚Äôre waiting on the appeal. Please keep us updated on how it goes!(#3)Keep us posted! I am European and I am waiting for it. I hoped my life would be completly different by  now, but it has not been approved yet.(#4)Just got prescribed that today. Now the whole insurance craziness starts. I too am curious about others experiences.(#5)First shot coming March 21.  I'm coming off of Nucala."
did all of you get to do a pulmonary function test before being officially told that u have asthma,6,0.88,13,"(#1)I had a pulmonary function test after intentionally triggering my asthma in order to get diagnosed (my untriggered pulmonary function tests always come back normal but if my asthma gets triggered first, the test is unambiguously showing asthma).

Having you try out whether a rescue inhaler works can give a strong indication for asthma (if it does work well, there's a high likelihood you have asthma, and if it doesn't work, it's most likely it's something else, iirc), but it seems really weird to diagnose you with allergic asthma without a pulmonary function test and an allergy test... (especially since panic attacks can absolutely mimic asthma symptoms!)(#2)Nope, I told my doctor my symptoms, she said it‚Äôs probably asthma, she prescribed me an inhaler and said if it helps then we were right. 

A few years later with a different doctor, I had a test to confirm it.(#3)ya you deserve some proper lung function test. They don't even take long. You would the full nine yards, like your doctor wouldn't want them for his family.(#4)Yes. But it was blamed on anxiety for YEARS. I just kept going to emerg with shortness of breath and finally one emerg doctor referred me to a cardiologist. The cardiologist took one look at me and sent me to a Respirologist. The respirologist said we‚Äôd do the test but he expected it to come back negative. SUPRISE! asthma üòí(#5)Ask for a test, especially considering you have a panick disorder that has similar symptoms. Besides, if it really is asthma it would be good to know your allergies (triggers)(#6)Yeah i had to breath in this machine then my dr sat my mom down and said ur son has uncontrolled moderate asthma(#7)Mines kinda similar, I have allergenic asthma and dust mold and straw are my main triggers, my doctor didn‚Äôt do any tests whatsoever, I told him what happened he sound it‚Äôs sounds like allergenic asthma, gave me a rescue inhaler and that was that(#8)I didn't. My dad (asthmatic) took me to the GP and said ""hey, my kid's been wheezing like me and it goes away when I give her a puff of my inhaler, so I'm pretty sure she's asthmatic"" and the doctor said ""yeah that sounds about right."" 

Runs on both sides of my family so the odds were high(#9)Nope. I was diagnosed at 12 based on symptoms. No doctor has even brought up testing since.(#10)I was diagnosed as a baby no tests. Asthma doesn't always show up on pulmonary function tests so they mostly seem to go by if inhalers work. I only recently had any tests and that because my asthma had become hard to treat and they needed to rule out other possibilities.

As for cat allergy. I have two cats and can bury my face in their fur without any issues but I have reacted to cats in the past. It's not always as simple as cat equals reaction. Mostly it about the dander and some cats produce more than others. Also sometimes I only react if I'm exposed to something else I'm allergic to ie if I'm already suffering from hayfever and my cat comes for a cuddle I do sometimes react to them. It might be worth doing some allergy tests to confirm what you are allergic to.(#11)I had no idea I even had asthma until I had a pulmonary function test due to a suspected allergy(#12)No I found out when I was 11.  My doctor gave me an inhaler. Albuterol.  Stated if this works you have ASTHMA.  I didn't know what it was.  Seems weird but I developed asthma after getting pneumonia.  I was diagnosed officially when I was and test when I was 13.(#13)My doctor sent my for a pulmonary function test and after being on the wait list for 9 months I went and it did not detect asthma. I spoke to my doctor and explained my symptoms, when they happen, how i remember having symptoms in P.E class since elementary school, my late Dad's history with severe asthma, and the fact that all three of my siblings and I all have the same asthma symptoms as my Dad did. 

Two siblings also did the same test in the past and came back negative too but they didnt pursue it further.

Lol I basically told the doctor that I am 100% certain I have it.

He prescribed me an inhaler in the meantime and is sending me for a methacholine challenge test... which will be a long waitlist again (Canada).

I've been walking around to trigger symptoms on purpose and using my inhaler, and holy shit.. its a life changer.. ive never felt what its like to breathe normally while walking...why didn't my parents do this when I was a kid? My mom even said ""I remember you telling my you couldn't breathe in P.E. class and thats why you always 'forgot' your P.E. strip""

Unfortunately I was one of those kids who kind of always cried wolf about illnesses and disorders to get attention in school and from my parents (middle child).. so I don't think people believed me in general when I had a real problem."
I have mild nocturnal asthma. I don‚Äôt need an inhaler during the day. First time user here. My insurance sucks and is telling me i have to pay $25 bucks for it. How long can i stretch my use of the inhaler?,16,0.81,47,"(#1)25 a month is so cheap. I was paying 60 for Advair at one point. The market price without insurance for that inhaler is 500-600.(#2)Dulera is not a ‚Äúuse when needed‚Äù inhaler. It‚Äôs a combo drug (steroid/beta agonist), and must be taken every day to be effective. Nocturnal asthma is tricky as severe attacks can happen while you‚Äôre sleeping. You‚Äôre being treated with Dulera to control the severity/frequency of your asthma. $25 a month is insanely cheap for Dulera. Please take it as prescribed. Nocturnal asthma is very unpredictable.(#3)Dude , my maintenance inhaler is $130 a month , $25 is nothing(#4)25..wow mine is 10x that a month(#5)$25 is steep? I‚Äôm paying 150 for Advair and almost 200 for breo. No insurance. $25 dollars a month too breath properly is not steep.(#6)Something you should consider is listening to your doctor and taking it everyday as prescribed for as long as the doctor seems necessary. Maintenance inhaler does not only help with controlling your asthma in the moment. It can help prevent your asthma from getting much worse and doing irreparable damage to your lungs in the long run. My asthma was ok for years so I didnt treat it much. Now it got worse and it sucks and I wish I did things differently but its too late.(#7)have you looked for manufacturers coupons? or call your pharmacy and ask if they know of any coupons?(#8)My inhaler is 300 a month. I fucking wished it was 25(#9)You may be able to get samples from your doctor to help but they won't be able to do that every month.  If you have insurance,  look online on their website at drug formulary  and see what would be similar but cheaper. They are listed under tier 1 and up.  Your tier 1 drugs will be the cheapest or possibly free and are preferred for your insurance.  If you find one cheaper you can ask your doctor or just print out the formulary and bring to your doctor if you aren't sure what to ask for.  I think you just don't understand and your doctor didn't explain things well so hope you ignore the rude comments.  You've gotten some really helpful responses, too. Hope it all works out for you.  Breathing is important!(#10)Hey op! I really recommend having an in depth chat with your doctor about your asthma and how you feel it isn‚Äôt severe enough to warrant this medication. I did the same a while ago and I‚Äôm so glad I did! There‚Äôs one of two possible outcomes:
1. Your doctor agrees with you and you two work out a more appropriate treatment plan. Great! 
2. Your doctor disagrees with you and explains why. This happened to me, and I received quite the shock. My dr had to go as far as explaining exactly how an asthma attack leads to death. Hopefully you aren‚Äôt as stubborn as me, lol. 

Either way, you guys (ideally) end up on the same page, which was something I never really thought was possible with a doctor, but is so so valuable to your health care(#11)You're complaining about a measly $25? I hope you never discover what one of these actually costs.

You can't stretch the inhaler, you need to use it as prescribed.(#12)How did you figure out you had mild nocturnal asthma?(#13)$25 is actually cheap. I work for my insurance company and still pay more than you, lol.(#14)Where do you live that $25 a month on medication is steep? Certainly not in USA(#15)Interestingly, I also have asthma that is nocturnal much of the time‚Äîor I wake using the morning with it feeling pretty bad. I‚Äôve had asthma my whole like and I‚Äôm 50 now. Finally had a doctor tell me that post nasal drip while sleeping was being aspirated, making it worse. He prescribed Flonase and ever since, my inhaler usage is down. Flonase is over the counter, but my doctor called in a prescription for me. I use the Costco pharmacy. With my insurance, it‚Äôs only $7. I realize everyone‚Äôs insurance is different, but Costco does tend to be cheaper. Thought I‚Äôd throw that out there in case it might help you in some way.(#16)Shit mine with insurance is $60 bucks be grateful(#17)$25!?  Come on man...(#18)I would look at it this way....that $25 a month might end up saving you a few thousand. Hospitals aren't cheap. My last 5 day asthma stay was over $40,000. After I surance I still owed $6000.(#19)$25? I am paying $350 for mine‚Ä¶"
Are you sensitive to the indoor air? Or have weak symptoms?,7,0.89,3,"(#1)Unfortunately for me my asthma symptoms get worse with fresh spring air or fresh fall air. But I live in the Midwest where the pollen count is always pretty high.

On the other hand whenever I go to the ocean, I breathe better outside than any other time in my life. Fresh salt air is so very healing to my lungs.(#2)Yup, I used to have that. Then I started getting allergy shots that included dust mites, and never stopped. I've been on them for over a decade, and don't have any plans of stopping, because I don't ever want to re-develop allergies. 

Also yes, I'm sensitive to dry air. But I live in Pacific Northwest, so that's usually not a problem. When I travels to Utah though, I sleep with a humidifier on.(#3)There are things that thrive in indoor environment due to lack of sunlight and more moisture. Then there are things that float easily in the outside air. For eg. indoor allergies can be due to dust mites and pollen for outdoor allergies. I am allergic to both. My meds help with the symptoms. Inhaler for asthma and nasal spray for the allergies."
I‚Äôm new to asthma and have a question,3,1.0,3,"(#1)When your asthma isn't well controlled, those are common symptoms.(#2)Nope. Consider using your rescue inhaler to see if it goes away. If it does, that confirms it‚Äôs asthma and see your doctor for a controller med.  If it doesn‚Äôt go away when you use your inhaler, that is not conclusive as there are some asthma circumstances where the rescue inhaler might not help."
Racing heart on steroid medication?,3,0.72,21,"(#1)Are you talking nasal spray or a you referring to Pulmocort, the asthma inhaler?

Steroid medications generally do not cause increased heart rate and it's not listed as a common or rare side effect for budenoside.(#2)I have budesonid (Symbicort), and it is combined inhaler. It says it can cause heart palpitations and chest pounding but that it should go away after use.(#3)How much are you using? Corticosteroids can elevate heart rate but it's usually mild.(#4)I had this issue but with LABAs. I basically couldn‚Äôt take them for the longest time because my heart would race so much. My pulmonary switched me to a nebulizer version where I could do half doses. I‚Äôve been on it for 8 months and I‚Äôve since been able to go from a half dose to a full dose twice a day.(#5)The same thing happens to me!  I had a hunch it was my inhaler but wasn't sure.  Glad I'm not the only one with this happening(#6)I actually had this as a side effect with one of my inhalers (Relvar ellipta). My doctor switched me while insisting it is not the problem, but it went away without it. No other inhaler had this effect and I do wonder if it was just me being weird/making it up, but the switch helped, so talk to your doctor!(#7)I think it‚Äôs the other component, not the corticosteroid. This happened to me with Advair."
Has anyone noticed an improvement in their mental health/anxiety after they stopped taking montelukast or singulair?,11,0.77,15,"(#1)Please search the sub for this same question, since it's asked about twice a month every single month.(#2)What to use as an alternative?
I am feeling alot of anxiety and temper issues after montelukast.(#3)I stopped taking It about a year ago, because my new doctor recommended to take fostair instead. I don‚Äôt feel any difference except that my asthma got better but my allergic rhinitis worse. I gess it was a side effect that magically made my nasal stuff better. But with nasal steroids it‚Äôs fine. I find my anxiety level to be similar than before.(#4)I quit having bizarre nightmares. Sleep better feel better. Otherwise I did not have any mental health side effects. The dreams were very disruptive to my sleep schedule and led to some crap days for sure. I was way happier after stopping the medicine which wasn‚Äôt critical to my asthma therapy(#5)[FDA strengthens warning about mental health side effects linked to montelukast](https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/9177)

and this is probably why:

[Common medications accumulate in gut bacteria, which may reduce drug effectiveness and alter the gut microbiome](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-09-common-medications-accumulate-gut-bacteria.html)

So after you quit taking Singulair, take a regiment of probiotics to restore your gut bacteria.(#6)Any pills or inhalation contains anti inflammatory steroids just drove me crazy - anxiety, nervous, etc.(#7)I took it in 2016 and my anxiety got so bad that I came off it after a few months. 
Unfortunately I had to go back on it 3 months ago as my asthma was really bad again. My anxiety is awful again now .I've increased my antidepressant to see if that would help and that's improved my mental state but I still have the anxiety. 
I know coming off Montelukast would stop this but then my asthma would be awful again. It works brilliantly for my asthma , I've barely used my reliever over the last 3 months so it's a hard choice for me.(#8)Hey, I got off singulair several months ago and my mental health has improved drastically. I used to cry literally everyday, started displaying bipolar traits, and had suicidal ideation. My doctor pretty much was gaslighting me and told me I just needed to go to therapy, so I did and that didn‚Äôt help either. I quit singulair and my mood improved within 2 weeks. I never cry anymore and my mood is very regular now. I also tried flovent after that which gave me anxiety, but I asked my doctor to put me on a child‚Äôs dose and that helped tremendously. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô1 and 95ish pounds, so I take 44 mcg flovent twice daily and it has my asthma very well controlled along with zyrtec and flonase. Maybe look into a lower dose ICS to avoid any anxiety symptoms if you start taking it. Hope this helps ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è(#9)Every once in a while i try to stop taking singulair. i find i get anxious but i believe this can be a withdrawl thing . cause i am low income i cant be on it forever so sometimes i try to train my body to try to go off it , not always smart cause my asthma isnt really well controlled but i find the anxiety i get is much worse than the asthma symptoms i get going off it !(#10)I am taking singular everyday for the past week due to recent asthma attacks and personally I feel fine, maybe because I take antidepressant pills at the same time for mood lifting.(#11)I currently take Tellegy after being on symbicort for 4 years.....however I DID notice a bit more anxiety when I stooped the symbicort.  Don't know if there is any correlation between what you were taking and what I was taking."
Vitamin D3 and allergic asthma?,24,0.96,18,"(#1)There been studies that its shown to help asthma. It helps me.(#2)Go to a doc. There's a simple blood test to determine if you are low on vitamin d, iron, etc.(#3)My doctor has me on Vitamin D3 for low D levels. And my asthma is controlled along with a controller medication.(#4)Vitamin D3 with K2 has been shown to even be a nice mild alternative to prednisone. It helps inflammation tremendously!

Understanding not all can jump off prednisone.. however it can help. It won‚Äôt be as potent for sure, but there won‚Äôt be long term damage like prednisone can do to some.(#5)I'm always really low on vitamin D outside of literally the summer season. It's probably why I overall feel like crap. But I too have allergic asthma type stuff all year. It sucks.(#6)Vitamin D can help any type of inflammation process in some people, including asthma. Most people are lacking vitamin D. If you‚Äôre able to go out in the sun for a bit after taking your supplement it activates it faster is what I‚Äôve always been told.(#7)You might have been deficient. Taking any supplement or medication for deficiencies will make you feel better. There have studies on Vitamin D that shows it's anti inflammatory behavior but take it with a grain of salt.(#8)Vitamin D is great for immune systems.   It enhances the function of immune cells. Deficiency in vitamin D is associated with increased autoimmunity as well as an increased susceptibility to infection.    So it's not a coincidence that improving your Vitamin D levels if they were deficient would help the problem.   Again it's improving a deficiency that helps and  42% of people in the US are deficient, it's not mega dosing.   When in doubt ask your doctor for a blood test.(#9)Was it really only 400 iu?(#10)Are you using your mouth to breathe?
For me this is the main trigger of my asthma. Using my nose made it dissappear.(#11)Because of these people https://www.vitamindsociety.org/ I upped my D3 to 1000 IUs daily and have seen a huge change in my life, in all aspects of my health.


Edit- I do get annual blood tests to make sure I‚Äôm not over medicated. I also increased my iron because I found out I am anemic even though I eat a lot of vegetables.(#12)Vitamin d3 helps alot im on 4000 in per day. Doctor prescribed it.  I can't stand prednisone.(#13)Have you had your vitamin D levels before supplementing tested?"
Asthma and anesthesia,6,0.76,8,"(#1)WTH do you mean they kept forgetting? Did you bring singulair with you? Whenever you go to the hospital, bring your meds with you, tell the staff and keep taking them, unless Dr gives you a good enough reason not to (with a mitigation strategy of what to do when you get exacerbation as a result).(#2)Not a doctor. 
The issue is if you're intubated. The pressure will irritate your lungs, you don't need to be intubated for oral surgery, because you're not full sedated. 

Make sure to tell your hospitalist and the anesthesia team about your concerns. You can be given Albuterol first and IV steroids during the surgery if necessary..(#3)/u/ehenn12 is exactly right. I'm going to guess when you were waking up, you did a lot of coughing due to the irritation from the intubation tube.(#4)Yeah I've had a few asthma episodes waking up from anesthesia - I just give the nurses my inhaler and they have it with me in recovery in case I need it. It's a scary feeling, but they deal with much worse on a day to day basis."

Has there been a verdict made on Covid and Asthma yet. Slighly terrified.,24,0.93,37,"(#1)As far as I know asthmatics are underrepresented in the data because there are actually less sick asthmatics then there should be and scientists are not sure why. 

Furthermore there were some hypothesis that the steroids we take on a daily basis with our preventative inhalers are beneficial in case of infection.

I even googled the active ingredient of my inhaler and saw that they are doing trials for using it as covid therapy.

I got covid a week ago. Double vaxxed with AZ, no booster. I was absolutely fine, it felt like a cold. I think you'll be alright.(#2)My son got, what I assume was, Omicron in January. He had a high fever for three days, chills, and fatigue. When we saw his pulmonologist after she said that the pneumovax booster he got over the summer, his daily Flovent, and being fully vaccinated probably all made it okay for him. She was very glad he managed to avoid Delta.(#3)I got covid in January and had night time wheezing for 6 weeks after. My breathing luckily was fine. No congestion but had dry cough. I wouldn‚Äôt bet on any data being accurate.(#4)I had it. I have pretty severe asthma. Didn't bother me much. I survived(#5)Asthmatic here! üëã, since I was about 7 or so. I had covid in January 2021, pre-vaxx. I had no lung issues at all, it was weird actually. Felt crappy and exhausted, but no lung issues at all.  My asthma is controlled with flovent 220 twice a day. Good luck and try not to stress too much about it(#6)Basically what kills from Covid is an overreaction of the immune system and steroids are there to inhibit the immune system.

Therefore, steroids counter the most damaging aspect of COVID.

Scarring in the lungs happens because of a Cytokine Storm: immune system going overdrive.(#7)Had covid in Jan. 2 shots, no booster. It was a bad head cold for me. The unfortunate part is I'm dealing with long covid stuff but I deal with much of the same after the flu so it didn't surprise me. My lungs have no damage from covid based on my most recent xray. Still need to do a PFT soon though(#8)Chronic asthmatic here. Triple vaxxed. According to the specialist asthma nurse, I'm the first severe asthmatic in my city to get Covid, and I got it this last week. 

Everyone said as long as I was using my preventers I should be fine. In fact, that's what all the research is showing. My body has decided to be different (my doctor from years ago called it the '*nz* twin effect' because u/buzzybnz and I never reacted to things in the expected way) and I'm struggling with more breathlessness and coughing than expected. I've been put on Prednisone which seems to be helping and been told to keep a close eye on my saturation levels. 

My suggestion is hope for the best but be prepared.(#9)Get the vaccine unless you have a very good reason not to.(#10)One anecdotal report for you. I'm fully vaccinated and boostered and (presumably) got Omicron two weeks ago from my child. As soon as I knew my kid was positive, I immediately increased my Symbicort dose and used albuterol as needed (normal plan with my doctor)- and despite testing positive I was fine! I was a little tired for a few days, had a mild fever one afternoon, and coughed a few times. A ""simple"" cold has often led to significantly more serious asthma complications.(#11)My dad caught Covid in Early January yet I manged not to. Hes still breathless and has the occasional wheeze but he bounced back after 3 days. He likes to think its because hes triple vaccinated(#12)As a smoker and asthmatic. I have had covid delta and omricon. No fever.  Delta breathing issues.  Worst thing that got me was my anxiety bc my diabetic wife got really bad.  Coughing up blood.  So sufferring from general anxiety disorder made thing intense. But as far as being ill no fever chills and I just found out I have sleep apnea so that explains alot.  The fact is im tired of being afraid.  After 2 years of this bs.  I'm like f it.  If it's my time to go so be it.(#13)Im asthmatic, caught covid twice, its anecdotal, but it havent even spike my asthma during the time i was sick, slight throat soar and headaches were my symptoms(#14)I have asthma and I had covid. I am vaccinated and it was like having a typical cold for me but I did lose taste and smell.(#15)I have covid now, triple vaxxed and my asthma is not affected.(#16)Didn‚Äôt impact my asthma whatsoever. Not a verdict just an experience and I have severe asthma(#17)Get your shots, you'll be fine(#18)My asthma did fine from Covid however; I‚Äôm suffering from an eardrum that is barely vibrating and may have to have a tube put in my ear from all the fluid in my head.  All the snot from Covid stayed on my head and nowhere near my chest.(#19)Im astmatic and had covid twice, first time i had to deal with long covid unfortunately, second time it was more like a heavy cold. Don‚Äôt worry too much it seems in general asmatic people don‚Äôt suffer more than anyone else with covid(#20)I‚Äôve had asthma all 30 years of my life so far and got Covid about a month ago. I‚Äôm vaccinated so when I first started showing symptoms, I thought it was a cold-runny nose, congestion, slightly tight chest, mild headache. I kept my sense of taste/smell. The hardest part, which wasn‚Äôt all that hard, was accepting that my rescue inhaler didn‚Äôt do anything for my chest tightness. It wasn‚Äôt bad in that I needed my nebulizer but it was there and just annoying. I recovered in about a week and have been fine since.(#21)It's important to remember that vaccines and the booster will decrease the severity of symptoms from COVID-19 and, since asthmatics are generally very cautious about respiratory difficulties, most of us are likely vaxxed. I've heard from a lot of asthmatics that it just felt like a cold.(#22)I have pretty severe asthma and got COVID in January 2021 between my initial 2 vaccines. Got the antibody infusion because my asthma was already going south after just a couple days and took a long taper of high dose steroids in addition to all my other asthma meds. Breathing stunk for a good two weeks, but slowly got back to baseline over the next month or so. Just did lots of nebs and tried to rest as much as possible since moving dropped my oxygen levels big time. Just had PFTs a couple months ago and my lungs are working just as well as they did prior to COVID, so it possible to get through it with no lasting issues. I really think having the vaccine is the key in keeping the risk of having a severe issue down."
Air purifier,8,1.0,13,"(#1)https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-air-purifier/

I have the coway. Like with most units- you don't have to replace the HEPA every month(just yearly,) but you do have to wipe off the screen regularly and replace the prefilter every few months. 

Anything that doesn't have a replaceable filter sounds like a scam. Where's all the stuff it's picking up going, then?(#2)I have a levoit brand and like it(#3)If you've used them before and it's helped your asthma, I couldn't reccomend a better purchase, I've suffered from asthma since I was 2, in hospital at least once a year until I was 12-13, anything that helps is always good. Asthma sucks but it can be very manageable with the correct inhalers, I would also recommend a respiratory consultant to help find correct inhalers to suit your form of asthma. I was put on multiple different inhalers, dry powder, mixed steroid, and mostly steroid inhalers. I would love to try a herbal alternative but after prescriptions charges it works out cheaper for inhalers, I'm just glad I'm not in America, no way i could afford 300 dollars for a blue/reliever inhaler(#4)Purifiers are great, but money has been a little tight over the last couple of years.  What I ended up doing was DIY-ng one to see if it worked.  So far so good.  It's a little noisy, but the white noise it creates kind of helps me sleep.

I basically bought a cheap [box fan](https://passionatepennypincher.com/box-fan-walmart-deals/) and taped a heavy duty large surface area [20 x 20 x 5](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Nordic-Pure-20-x-20-x-5-Honeywell-Lennox-Replacement-MERV-12-FPR-9-Air-Filter-1-Pack-20x20x5HM12-1/312515470) filter to the back of it. I run it most of the day/night only had to buy a new filter about 6 months in, and that is me just being cautious. What you want is that deep 5 inch filter though.  It allows for more surface area for air to be pulled.  It makes the fan run smoother.(#5)I have an Austin Air, the filter is a huge canister that's supposed to last five years. For what it cost, I hope it really does last that long. 

I had to replace the cord recently, and so I didn't have it running for about two weeks until I could get a replacement cord and find time to make the repair. During that time, I was having to use my inhaler more frequently and the house didn't smell as fresh as usual. I hadn't realized how much it was doing until then."
Shortness of breath even when using my inhaler.,8,1.0,21,"(#1)My doctor told me to go to the ER if I have an attack and inhaler doesnt help in an hour or so. They can give you some strong stuff to help calm the attack down.(#2)What I do to try and help is just in through the nose out through the mouth, I don‚Äôt try and take deep breaths because that makes me more anxious knowing I can‚Äôt at the moment and it just makes me worse. But then again none of this may help you due to the fact that my asthma is mainly caused by anxiety/when I‚Äôm really tired or around allergens(#3)I would call a doctor just to be safe(#4)I do not have asthma, but I have shortness of breath and never could find a diagnosis nor a fix. Been taking inhalers for months with very little help. My last doctor told me to get off symbicort and told me an interesting technique of controlling my breath. He noticed i was sighing a lot looking for a breath, also yawning but no air was getting through, so instead he told me whenever i look for those deep breaths to resist that urge and hold ur breath for a while then return to ur normal breathing pattern to stabilize the pacing and urges. It did help me a bit, although sometimes there is a learning curve, worked better with time. U cant really die from holding ur breath, ur body wont let u and it can help u stabilize breathing patterns if u hyperventilate or for some reason have urges to take deep breaths despite having enough oxygen in ur body.

Of course if you are worried and feel badly I encourage seeing a doctor or going to the ER if things escalate; dont take it as a medical advice.(#5)Please go see a doctor. That said, hit your inhaler again. I‚Äôve been instructed by doctors that you can safely do two puffs every two hours for emergencies (like don‚Äôt do this every day but if you have a bad day you can keep doing a couple puffs every hour or two)(#6)Go to the emergency room.(#7)I see you said your nose is partially blocked, if you can get a nasal.spray and start breathing through your nose regularly you will have less asthma attacks. 

And don't forget, anxiety induced asthma is very real. Try to stay calm.(#8)Hello, 
 I‚Äôm a 21f and my asthma is more shortness of breath so instead of wheezing when my asthma acts up it‚Äôs more like labored breaths and panting. For me when it got really bad last October I had to do a round of prednisone for 5 days. It was hell cause that steroid is strong and after a while it did end up helping but honestly talk to ur doctor asap it‚Äôs better to nip it in the bud now then have to suffer with it because trust me Ik how draining it is to just try to get your breathing back on track. I would either schedule an appointment or if it‚Äôs worsening just go to the ER and they can help u from there even give you a treatment. 

Also for the nasal blockage I have year round congestion and it‚Äôs hard breathing through my nose which makes my anxiety worse. I would ask ur doctor for so Flonase if possible that stuff really helped me just one spray in each nostril morning and night and after a few days it really made a difference. 

I hope you‚Äôre feeling better and hopefully getting plenty of rest and drinking lots of fluids!!(#9)Sounds like heart trouble rather than asthma(#10)Did you recently have Covid or another URI? Could be pulmonary edema (fluid around the lungs), happens to some young people with extremely reactive immune systems. See your doctor"

Unfortunately no other inhaler ist working for me, so I guess I'll have to live with the fat face :-/(#4)I‚Äôve been on this since 2018. I do think my face shape looks a little fuller. It could be aging though. No changes elsewhere.(#5)ICS usually does not cause this but oral prednisone can. You should make an appointment with your doc since this would be an incredibly unusual side effect of ICS.(#6)Talk to your doctor. That doesn‚Äôt sound normal."
Movies right ?,16,0.87,5,"(#1)Yeah, it's just asthma, can't be that bad.

I forgot yesterday and by like 2pm I couldn‚Äôt breathe(#3)It's probably why in real life so many people with anxiety do the exact same thing.

These Covid-19 symptoms raise new questions,1,1.0,2,"(#1)Because so many deaths were due to respiratory failure, many colleagues I talked with expected to find progressive pneumonia with lung destruction as the cause. However, researchers discovered something entirely different: blood clots in the lungs (also referred to as pulmonary emboli). Furthermore, they found countless additional smaller clots in many other organs as well. (Note that experts distinguish between clot and thrombus and embolus but for simplicity, we'll call them all clots.)"
Warped Salbutomol Canister,22,1.0,12,"(#1)I put an inhaler through the dryer in my pocket once, and it did that.(#2)Please dispose of this live grenade immediately(#3)Probably overheated.

That is extraordinary. Never seen that in 40 years of using puffers.

As others commenters have pointed out, the cylinder is badly weakened, probably by heat.

Due to its shape, that is meant to be the strongest part of the cylinder, similar to any other gas cylinder."
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction caused by electrolyte problems,2,0.75,14,"(#1)What disease do you have that burns through electrolytes during exercise? I think what you are feeling in your legs may be lactic acid build up. Lactic acid build up is extremely common as we dehydrate. I like in a very hot climate. In the summer, when I run, I bring some Saltstick tabs with me. I can chew a couple tabs with water to replenish the electrolytes I lose by sweating.

Low electrolytes are usually a sign of dehydration.(#2)Supplement electrolytes? Mg and K are in standard multis as well as electrolyte drinks (along with NaCl.)

How long have you been running? Maybw dial it back so you're not working as hard. Give your muscles more of a chance to adjust.(#3)I am very confused by your post. Did a doctor tell you that your EIB is caused by electrolyte problems or did you figure this out on your own?"

Looking for spacer for ROUND mouthed inhaler (comments for more info),3,1.0,7,"(#1)Ask your pharmacy if they have an adapter - we used to have one for a round inhaler to fit into the squarer style spacer hole.

Symbicort to Trelegy ellipta.,2,1.0,7,"(#1)Holy smokes where did you hear it was fatal to take both? I was desperate a few days and took both ü§≠. I have since gotten so tired of steroids I have just gone back to a lot of staying healthy, using hot teas and rescue inhaler when needed(#2)My allergist told me I could take extra hits of Symbicort while on Breztri. Lol.(#3)IANAD. Taking a shot in the dark here.

You could have seen the long-acting beta agonist (LABA) black box warning about the increased risk of death with that medication class. Every medication that contains them is required to have that warning, including Symbicort, Trelegy, and Breztri.

Stand-alone LABAs used to be indicated for asthma, but there was an uptick in death and complications in patients that took them that wasn‚Äôt seen in patients that took combo meds, like the ones you‚Äôre talking about. They still are required to include the warning though even though they don‚Äôt have the same risk.

People switch between maintenance meds all the time. Overdosing is possible, but unless you‚Äôre taking more than one several times a day against prescriber instructions, or you have a metabolic abnormality that‚Äôs causing accumulation, probably not gonna happen. If there were a risk or waiting period I imagine your prescriber would have stressed that.

Reach out to your doctor if you‚Äôre concerned. You are more than likely fine to stop your old meds and immediately begin your new one as your daily driver.(#4)Just an update here, I ended up waiting till this morning to take the Trelegy. Now I've been dealing with asthma since I was really young,going to get shots twice a week, allergists all the time etc, I am 47 now and when I took this medication I felt like I could breath better than I ever have! Let's see how this works out in the weeks to come. Do any of you have some pros and cons about taking Trelegy?"
Steroid inhaler - side effects,2,0.75,13,"(#1)This doesn't sound like a side effect to me. Do you have any other weird new symptoms, like itchy skin, a rash or hives somewhere, sneezing, anything that could point to an allergic reaction? That's the only thing I can think of to link it to your inhaler...(#2)Is this prescribed by a doctor? If so, I'd go back to them as they make have something else to help seeing as you're not asthmatic
Always better to ask than to suffer :D(#3)Sometimes when I first started using Flovent (steroid inhaler) it would make me feel very physically weak for up to 24 hours. That was listed as one of the rarer side effects (not on the box, but when I searched online), and it always went away by the second day, so I never bothered to talk to my doctor about it. Now I‚Äôm on an inhaled steroid long term, so I‚Äôm never starting it, so I don‚Äôt get that. 

Oral steroids (prednisone) make me completely lose my appetite, but only orally.(#4)I used inhaler that made me sick when I had higher doses. I changed it recently and since then I had no issues with my stomach.

Before I had ciclesinoid and now I'm using budesonide. Both are corticosteroids but I guess they have some difference. Side effects of first one stated it could cause stomach issues.

But it doesn't mean it's that, maybe you just need to get used to it.

For reference, after I changed my meds, new inhaler made me a bit shaky and have some palpitations (which it said it could and it's quite normal after you start), but with some longer use I no longer have those problems.(#5)With me i had that with flovant but it passes , the nausea thing"
How much are you paying for your steroid inhaler? Symbicort is listed at $300 per month. Is there a way around this? Have you been able to find a cheaper one that works?,34,0.97,116,"(#1)USA's health prices never fails to scare me to hell, for me it costs $9 dolars witouth the ""insurance"" and $4.50 with my health plan.(#2)Look and see if Mark Cuban‚Äôs website will help! He has some asthma medication on there that‚Äôs typically significantly cheaper than other providers, regardless of insurance.(#3)GoodRx is a good option sometimes. When I was on birth control pills I used it because it was cheaper to buy without running it through my insurance.(#4)Do you have insurance? My Symbicort is $10 with insurance.(#5)This works great for me, it's a generic and is less than $100: [https://www.tevagenerics.com/product/fluticasone-propionate-and-salmeterol-inhalation-powder-multidose-dry-powder-inhaler](https://www.tevagenerics.com/product/fluticasone-propionate-and-salmeterol-inhalation-powder-multidose-dry-powder-inhaler)

I actually went back to using Wixela 250/50 for now because my insurance won't cover the generic (wtf). But I used this with great results for the three years I either had no insurance or had insurance that would only cover Albuterol (my current insurance covers Wixela but not Albuterol, go figure).

I don't know why insurance companies get to prescribe our medicines for us, but there it is.(#6)Try good rx or ordering from Canada

And Canada 

https://www.northwestpharmacy.com/(#7)300?? Holy shit, its free for me in the Netherlands. I sometimes wonder why Americans in general are so much against health care systems like ours. Everytime I see your costs I consider myself very lucky that besides the monthly payment everything is free.(#8)I believe there is a generic for Symbicort. I'm not sure how good it is, but that may be a more affordable option to talk with your doctor about.(#9)There is a generic for Symbicort made by the same pharmaceutical company.(#10)My daughter‚Äôs symbicort cost 370 per inhaler. I know the pharmaceutical company has a copay assistance. I had to pay that for January and February because of the deductible. Now it is 40 dollars per inhaler.(#11)Better insurance.(#12)Look into Symbicort copay assistance. [Here](https://www.mysymbicort.com/cost-assistance.html) is the link. 

I check for copay assistance on every high copay medication for myself or my husband. It‚Äôs worth the extra effort at the pharmacy to get them to run it. 

It generally only works with private insurance, not Medicare or Medicaid. Looks like you have private insurance.(#13)My brother orders from India or Canada where it is cheap. In India they even give without doctors prescription.(#14)Wow, that‚Äôs really expensive. In Portugal it costs around 45‚Ç¨ without prescription. With prescription it has state comparticipation and it‚Äôs cheaper, around 10‚Ç¨.(#15)I go to the clinic and tell them I don‚Äôt have insurance and they hook me up with samples. 

I I just do this every few months. 

Disclaimer: I live in Canada(#16)WTF! I pay $5 every 3 months in New Zealand for 3x Breo Ellipta inhalers, I am so sorry :-((#17)Free NHS lol(#18)Damn thats crazy, in Brazil i pay around 20 Reais which is like 4 dollars. But I could even get it for free if I couldn't afford it(#19)Symbicort comes as a generic now. Check the price on the generic on GoodRx and AmazonPharmacy.(#20)In France Symbicort is 28 euros, refunded at 65% for everyone, and at 100% if you also have a private insurance.(#21)I used GoodRx and have the Teva Pharmaceutical generic inhaler as respiclick. Price is around $33 dollars without insurance(#22)$273 for Flovent, I use GoodRx(#23)$250 for Flovent HFA...wish I knew a way around it(#24)My symbicort is $120/ month without perception insurance in Canada(#25)I am in the US. With insurance I pay $45 for generic. It blows my mind the med that is meant to keep me out of an ED or UC is so expensive in generic form....(#26)35 with my insurance(#27)GoodRX(#28)17$ until I hit my 150$ max a year for all meds, than it‚Äôs free.(#29)$48 for 3 with my insurance for my son (mail order pharmacy). 

My old insurance it was $105 each so instead of going through insurance I went through the pharmacy at the clinic where they were selling them at $11 each.(#30)I'm without insurance at the moment. My generic symbicort is gonna be $250. I've paid upwards of $300 for it and as low as $95. Hopefully my new insurance makes it pretty cheap(#31)i pay $120 CAD for mine(#32)It‚Äôs expensive in Canada too , $130 per month for me in BC. A lot cheaper than $300 for sure though. But I can‚Äôt afford $130 even so I often get free samples from the local walk-in clinic. Not sure if that is possible anywhere else but maybe ask(#33)I haven‚Äôt done this yet but Mark Cuban created a company which offers generic versions of every prescription drug for a very good price. I‚Äôm gonna use it next time I need an inhaler
https://costplusdrugs.com(#34)If you are close to mexico they sell it for 45 dollars.(#35)My insurance covers the costs of my medications and has me pay a $3 copay. My Breo Ellipta is listed as $457 at my local Walmart.(#36)I have health insurance but it's still cheaper to buy the generic from northwestpharmacy.com. it's called foracort and I get 3 (120 puffs) inhalers for $200(#37)If you're willing to wait up to a month, you can get a generic version of Symbicort on reliableRX. I believe they're in India and they will indicate that you should upload a prescription, but you don't actually have to (it's slightly sketch, but not as sketch as the US health insurance system). I got 3 Symbicort inhalers for $60 including shipping, I just have to wait for super slow overseas shipping. Worth it to me because even with my insurance, a single steroid inhaler was going to cost me $100.(#38)They are cheap everywhere. I just travel and buy over the counter(#39)Wow in New Zealand I think it‚Äôs $5(#40)i pay nothing for flovant üò≥"
Anyone get a ‚Äú chronic cough ‚Äú,8,0.91,3,"(#1)Yes. I‚Äôve had a chronic cough since 2018. My pulmonologist believes that it‚Äôs exacerbated by post nasal drip. It‚Äôs worse in the past year. I was max dose on my preventative medication plus using spiriva, singulair and an antihistamine. Still coughing every day. Doctor put me on Dupixent at the end of December and I would say my coughing is reduced by about 75%. I‚Äôm on the minimum dose of preventative medication but still using the others as I was. 

If you have exhausted all your options talk to your doctor about other medication or check with an ENT doctor.(#2)Cough variant asthma is a thing. Have you tried your rescue inhaler when you‚Äôre coughing? For me it most often happens with cold humid air (so usually Jan-Feb, though this year it seems to be Feb-March), when I‚Äôm talking a lot (and I‚Äôm a teacher, so that‚Äôs weekdays)."
"Fiberglass in my bed! How to clean,?",3,0.8,14,"(#1)Get a new bed. 

If the bed is newer, call the manufacturer‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not normal.(#2)If it's a new bed, call the manufacturer; they may have a free or cheap replacement program. 

Other than that, how would any of us here know?(#3)This must be one of those foam beds üò¢(#4)I would put any mattress in one of those zippered covers and put a waterproof mattress protector on top of that. The zippered ones are hard to get on and take off, so the separate mattress protector solves that problem.(#5)[deleted]"
Alternative treatments other than steroid injalers,0,0.38,30,"(#1)What the heck kind of inhaler are you on? I‚Äôve had asthma on and off my whole life and am currently on advair but I‚Äôve never heard or had a problem like this. Also inhalers keep the steroid limited to your lungs it‚Äôs why they work so good, steroid pills would affect your whole body.
Edit: just to toss in make sure you rinse and gargle with water after.(#2)Outta luck as there‚Äôs no other inhaled anti inflammatory meds out there.

Can absolutely do oral corticosteroids, have a look at their list of side effects for long term use and you‚Äôll beg for an inhaler instead.(#3)Try using the inhaler with a spacer, that can help with hoarseness. I use inhalers all the time and I wouldn't say it's a common problem I have, but everyone is different. I wouldn't recommend oral steroids instead of inhaled steroids. They have so many full body long and short term side effects. Not something you want to mess with.(#4)I have had asthma my entire life and use steroid inhalers everyday twice a day and I‚Äôm a professional singer and also a voice actor. No horseness over here  at all I have a very large vocal range and it‚Äôs not stopped me in anyway. 

Edit. Also I‚Äôm 33 and by whole life I mean I‚Äôve been on them since I was 10 months old(#5)Steroid tablets are waaaay worse regarding possible side effects and long-term effects since they a) typically come in much higher doses and b) have systemic effects instead of just working right where they are needed.

Steroid inhalers as maintenance medication are pretty much gold standard for asthma, and there isn't really any good alternative. There are a few different ones, though, so if you do have intolerable-for-you side effects from one inhaler, you can switch to a different one.

Leaving asthma untreated can cause permanent lung damage long-term (plus the risk of death from a bad asthma attack), so just not treating it isn't really a good option either.(#6)I used to be quite the singer, made honor choir in high school. I'll be honest, steroids have changed my voice. My range isn't what it used to be in the upper register and I can sing lower notes than I used to be able to, as well as having more of a husky tone overall. I also stopped singing a lot when I started taking steroids. What they can cause is vocal cord paralysis and atrophy, but if you keep using your voice, you shouldn't have to worry about atrophy. That was the mistake I made but everything I've seen says it's reversible. I wouldn't recommend oral steroids unless you want to end up with bone damage.(#7)spiriva respimat.(i think thats what its called) thats what i recommend.

but i think you should try steroid inhalers to see if it helps because those symptoms did not occur for me and steroid use improved my singing. 

montelukast/singulair is an option. Its a pill. I have tried it and it gave me very psychedelic lucid/vivid dreams. I stopped it.

Steroids gave me oral thrush which is why i switched. :( even if i brushed my teeth and rinsed with listerine. In my singing this was not an issue but it may be for you. it is uncommon. i am immunodeficient that is why i got thrush. Steroids just invited the thrush in XD

 my doc gave me spiriva instead when he heard about my thrush. its like a ""supplemental treatment"" and he said its usually used in conjunction with other medicines but its mild and u might be able to use it. he said it wasnt roids. but it works the same as a roid inhaler did for me. 

BTW im a choir singer and ive had no issues with my singing on any of my past treatment plans. But here are some tips and i bet that if you use 2 or 3 of them, youll sing better even if youre on roid inhalers.


-get a vocal coach if you dont have one already. 

-literally just drink water. hydration helps. 

-Drink tea before singing or something hot

-Mix dry eucalyptus leaves into a bowl of boiling water and inhale the steam. Place a towel over your head to concentrate the steam if youd like. I recommend asking your doctor first just because idk if its possible to be allergic to eucalyptus. however this is a relatively safe eastern medicinal practice that ive used since my childhood.

-AVOID DAIRY!!!!!

-eat spicy food an hour or two before singing, and then clear out any mucus that expectorates.

-try Flonase instead (ASK YOUR DOCTOR) it works for some people with allergic asthma.

-warm up by singing ""me"" and go as high as you can, going up in a whole step scale. or chromatic scale. whichever. then go as low as you can. try the other vowels too but ""ee"" works best imo.

-Consider tiger balm, eucalyptus/vaporub nasal inhalers, vaporub.

-take hot baths or showers

-use listerine after taking steroids or using any inhaler of any kind.

-make an inhaler spacer. google it. it stops the steroids from hitting the back of your throat.

Anyways im not a doctor like i said so try these things in moderation... start small and see if it irritates you. Or ask your doctor if they agree/ have any holistic treatments for you to try! These things have worked in my experience even when i was taking killer levels of steroid inhalers so I wish you luck. You're not alone!(#8)I‚Äôm a singer ‚Äî not pro or anything, but been in choruses since I was 12, on steroid inhalers off and on since I was 22, and consistently on steroid inhalers for around 5 years now (currently 44). Steroids have never affected my singing voice nor my ability to sing. Asthma has, and at the worst I have needed to use my rescue inhaler both before a practice, and again during. You can‚Äôt sing if you‚Äôre simultaneously short of breath and hyperventilating. 

Rescue inhalers don‚Äôt solve everything about asthma ‚Äî asthma has two components: your airways both constrict (inside diameters get smaller), and inflame (walls get thicker and more mucus is produced). Rescue inhalers (albuterol, salbutamol) are bronchodilators, which mean they only help with the constriction, and not the inflammation. You need the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to help with the inflammation too. 

I‚Äôd recommend try it for a while, see if it‚Äôs a problem. If it is a problem, then ask your doctor about monteleukast (aka Singulair) as another choice, it‚Äôs an oral pill (so it‚Äôs systemic), but isn‚Äôt recommended as a first choice because it can cause or worsen depression or other psych side effects.(#9)I only notice hoarseness when I‚Äôm on a high dose of ICS like Advair 500/50. Since I don‚Äôt notice a difference in my breathing between 500 and 250, I stick with 250/50. See if you respond well to a low dose like 100/50. 

What you don‚Äôt want to do is take a LABA without an ICS. Your risk of death goes way up. You also don‚Äôt want to be messing around with oral corticosteroids if you don‚Äôt have to. They are systemic and have a wide range of negatives long term. 

The last recommendation I have is to rinse and gargle really well after using your inhaler. This not only prevents thrush (you really don‚Äôt want this) but also helps with hoarseness. I take my inhaler, rinse and gargle, brush my teeth, then rinse and gargle again.(#10)You could try Alvesco. It‚Äôs a prodrug, and the steroid isn‚Äôt activated before it reaches your lungs. So the probability of having systemic side effects is extremely small. You don‚Äôt even have to rinse your mouth after using it. I‚Äôve been on Advair for half my life, but was switched to Alvesco for a while. Advair affects my voice slightly, but I think I‚Äôm the only one who notices. When I was on alvesco, my voice went completely back to normal. Unfortunately, alvesco didn‚Äôt work for me, so I was switched back to Advair, but It works very well for lots of people.(#11)From my experience of being on a steroid inhaler for the four years I was in choir (plus 6 more years of being on the same steroid inhaler), hoarseness was never an issue for me. Yes it can happen along with thrush and long-term vocal chord damage, but my understanding is that rinsing (like the instructions for the inhaler say to) mitigates the risk for these side effects a lot. 

That being said, I have had hoarseness from a few steroid inhalers before (specifically advair and pulmicort flexhaler). In my experience both times the hoarseness either went away or became completely unnoticeable after a couple of days to a week from starting. Making sure I drank more water than usual and had hot tea with lemon and honey definitely seemed to help.(#12)Tablets are way more dangerous.(#13)Steroid tablets will wreck your organs. Find the right inhaler.(#14)I‚Äôve been fighting like hell to get off my steroids (trellegy). A lot of exercise and eating healthy. Addressing gut health, and I know this subReddit won‚Äôt like it but peppermint essential oil dropped in hot water (like tea) works nearly as good as a rescue inhaler for me. That being said sometimes none of this works and the only relief and option is steroids. My asthma severity has lessened after 2 years of steroids but that just one case"
What does your in-person social life look like right now w/the pandemic?,12,0.88,21,"(#1)I live in LA, and have a pretty broad social club of people who have been running experiments for me for the last 3 years. THANKS GUYS.  Various attitudes from just being a total dip shit, to believing in crystals, to being super mask/visor and still partying it up in Vegas..etc.

The only thing that I haven't done in the past 3 years, I guess now that I think about it, is park my ass at an inside bar.

My wife and I have been on a flight, we've stayed in hotels, and motels. We've eaten outside on patios, we've been inside a few times. We've gone to some events outside, some tiny, some HUGE.  We've gone to a lot of wine tasting, inside, outside. She's gone on trips with girlfriends in share cars, multiple times. Some of them have had covid before.

To my knowledge, my wife and I have avoided getting Covid the entire time.  She's a bit more courageous than me, I'm an asthmatic, but she's never gotten it.  We mask up when going inside, or around big crowds outside. That's really it.

Of that group of dip shits we know, a lot of them got Covid when they went to some DJ party at a hotel and had a party hotel room and all were hanging out there. DUH they got Covid, they probably got other shit as well. We had friends who couldn't stay out of the gym, they all got Covid.  Places where nasty gross shit spread, was never good in the first place, you should still stay out of it now. So no ""YOLO"" hotel parties after a day at a rooftop DJ pool party asses to elbows.  BUT to be honest, TODAY...I almost think that would be fine on average....be FULLY VAXED. 

But you gotta think, between being dead, being vaccinated, having Covid and both having covid while vaccinated.  Take 100 people, how many fall into that category of ""mostly safe"" and it's a lot.

Think about shit normally, I can't believe I used to go into public toilets or bar/pub toilets WITHOUT a mask. I'll be doing that the rest of my life.  I'm not ready to go to watch the Lakers in the Arena I dont think. So I'm still kinda side eyeballing indoor closed spaces....it would have to be an event I really want to see.

But I honestly think, depending on where you live, go about life normally.  Always have the mask, toss it on when you rock inside a place. If it feels empty and clean then take it off and enjoy. If it's asses to elbows, leave it on or leave.

It was pretty hard for my friends to get Covid, they had to be the dumbest people I knew, and they were. My wife and I were reasonably careful and we have been enjoying life almost the entire time.  We have a lot of at home tests, and we test up if we think something is off. So far so good.(#2)I'm vaccinated and still wear a mask when I go out. I don't do dine ins as much or go out drinking anymore because I just don't trust people. More small gatherings with friends for me(#3)I‚Äôve had terrible asthma my whole life. 

But my income is 100% social. 

So when I got vaccinated last year‚Ä¶ I considered it over. 

35/m/healthy otherwise if that helps(#4)I am curious, did you notice your asthma getting worse or better when staying inside all the time(#5)So I wasn't diagnosed until recently but up until a few months ago we lived in Florida. I also have young children and a mother in law who lives with us. So we took it very seriously from the beginning. We rarely went out and about and wore masks everywhere.....because...florida.

After 2 years of not being able to send the kids to school in person safely, we decided to take advantage of the market and leave Florida for a state with a better handle on mitigation measures (among other reasons). 

I just got out of the hospital on Sunday after 4 days and after a ton of testing I was diagnosed with asthma. Looking back I've had tons of red flags my whole life  but just related them to being out of shape instead of getting them checked out. So now I'm like omg this whole time I was wayyyy more at risk than I had initially thought. I'm already overweight due to having 5 kids and a thyroid problem so now that I know that asthma is in play I'm not planning on making any changes anytime soon even though the mandates have been lifted. I'll keep wearing masks, stay vaccinated  and keep my distance. Socializing doesn't really come up because I don't know anyone here anyway. 

I used to be a high school teacher as well and I don't think I'll be returning to the classroom either until I feel safe in large groups again. I don't really have to put in many boundaries because I'm super winded and constantly sound like I'm hacking up a lung so people in public tend to avoid me like the plague.(#6)Western Washington. I still mask everywhere in public. But I am back at the gym and doing most things in person with the exception of grocery shopping as there was a way too recent shooting at our local grocery.(#7)Never ever had a social life. I'm a loser....(#8)I pretty much stayed in also. I‚Äôm an introvert and could WFH, so it wasn‚Äôt horrible. Like you, my friends were not cool about it and I lost some friends, also over attitudes about vaccination and politics generally. Others I had to turn down invitations to meet in person. 

So my social life is texting new people I met from my online hobbies. Not great but it could be worse. Met some nice folks.(#9)My in person social life consists of my husband, kids, and parents. So still my pandemic bubble.(#10)Already had this huge covid exposure scare , plus this crazy asthma flare last year so honestly nothing scares me anymore lmfao ive got moderate asthma and i know if i got something like delta id be in huge trouble, when i chill with friends its either 2 or 3 people lmao like i said nothing scares me anymore(#11)I have a limited social life anyway because of other health problems. I did start to socialize outside last summer and over winter have had very limited social interaction inside. My friends are generally understanding that I'm vulnerable and willing to take a test before we get together.(#12)- I wear an n95 mask (or comparable) everywhere indoors except for my house. 

- Houseguests have to take a rapid covid test the day they come over. We also have HEPA air filters in the house. 

- if we eat out at restaurants, we either get takeout or (weather permitting) sit outside. 

That's my personal comfort level, and the standard everyone in my household is comfortable with. 

It really hasn't stopped us from doing anything except indoor restaurant dining. I basically live my normal life and don't avoid places (except indoor restaurants and, not that I'm inclined to normally, I probably wouldn't feel comfortable in a packed concert or something) because being triple vaxxed plus wearing a respirator is a really significant degree of protection. 

The worst we've had to deal with is (""covid is overblown"" type) family members grumbling about having to take a rapid test. Thankfully, most of our friends are also some degree of careful and will cancel plans if they feel unwell, so there haven't been any issues.

Anyone who tried to give me crap about wanting to protect my health wouldn't be my friend anymore. They're not the ones that have to deal with months of crushing misery after catching any old respiratory illness.(#13)Same as it looked like before 2020.

If I die, I die. I'm going to live my life and have a wonderful time doing it.(#14)i became anti social, moody/bitter, depressive.

it sucks .... but ... what can i do(#15)I only see my mom and go to doctors appointments/necessary things.  Haven‚Äôt hung out with friends in 2 years(#16)I've always been a recluse.  Nothing has changed.   üòÜ(#17)I go out as per normal if there are no restrictions, but from now on, I will wear a mask in an enclosed public space or where you are likely to be close to others.

I'm both asthmatic and a pulmonary sarcoidosis sufferer. If I were to get COVID, I would not survive it."
What OTC meds can help?,15,0.86,77,"(#1)Your child needs albuterol and you should definitely harass the shit out of medical professionals/services m to get it and go to urgent care if you don‚Äôt have inhaler in hand soon. She shouldn‚Äôt go overnight again needing and not having a rescue inhaler. I have used capsule here in NY to get inhalers delivered into the evening. If Sacramento doesn‚Äôt have timely delivery then a walk in medical appt is needed. Good luck there is nothing worse than seeing your child struggle to breathe(#2)Get her Albuterol. Take her urgent care, bug her doctor again, do a digital doctor visit, find a CVS minute clinic. Do whatever you need to do to make sure she doesn't need to go another night without Albuterol.

An asthma attack can go from ""not that bad"" to very serious, in less time then it will take to get her emergency help.(#3)Asthma attacks can get very bad, very quickly. Even if she‚Äôs getting better you NEED to get your hands on some albuterol. Don‚Äôt take that risk.(#4)Call the Dr.'s office, tell them you need prescription ASAP(#5)If you have a nebulizer, you might have old unused vials of albuterol. Using expired meds isn‚Äôt exactly recommended, but I‚Äôve done it in a pinch and it has worked perfectly fine in my experience. If you don‚Äôt have any old nebulizer meds lying around, you can also order some nebulizer saline online (amazon has it with fast prime shipping) and while that isn‚Äôt the same, I find it does help. They might have it in some pharmacies but I‚Äôm not sure.(#6)Not sure their age but caffeine can help. Black tea, green tea, coffee, etc. sleeping on side can help too if there‚Äôs a way you can keep her propped on her side(#7)If it‚Äôs triggered by allergies, maybe get some allergy medicine. For me it usually helps with my asthma too. Don‚Äôt know what kind of maintenance inhaler she has. I‚Äôm taking fostair twice a day. My doctor said if I feel sick or  have bad allergies, it‚Äôs actually better to get an extra third dose of fostair, instead of using albuterol. Don‚Äôt know why and pretty sure this is not true for all maintenance inhalers. Also chugging a lot of water helps me usually. Hope she gets better without having to go to the ER.(#8)I too suffer with chronic asthma , have done for years. I got lectured by my Immunologist, my asthma dr also...about never to think twice about calling 911 or getting to the emergency room if having very bad asthma attack. With your daughter not having her rescue inhalers I highly recommend getting her to the ER or urgent care as they will get her on a nebulizer right away and stabilized,  before she goes home. It's always better to be safe than sorry and as her parents you have to take the best care of her. My kids are all grown up, but I know they will always tell you they're OK cos a lot of times they're scared of having to go to the ER or seeing drs. 
Please keep us updated.(#9)N-Acetyl-Cysteine is amazing. Since I began taking it, I went from using my inhaler almost daily, to now a few times a month max.(#10)Everyone saying ‚Äúget her albuterol‚Äù obviously did not read the post or they don‚Äôt understand how difficult it can sometimes be when in a situation like this. Of course you know that that‚Äôs the solution.

Hot, hot green tea helps me so much when I‚Äôm out of or cannot afford albuterol. Even just breathing the steam from it in. You can get decaffeinated green tea for your little one; I add honey to help my throat when I‚Äôve been coughing. Possibly a little sugar to help her personally with the taste?

It‚Äôs definitely an iffy situation with her age. I remember when I was 10 and had my first asthma attack, the school nurse had me hold my head above steaming hot water (obviously not right in it) with a towel over the bowl and my head, and that helped sometimes.

Every time I‚Äôve been to the ER from it, they‚Äôve asked me to lie prone (on my tummy) and that helps a lot. They also do this with covid patients who have shortness of breath.

I can‚Äôt really think of anything else that is safe for your baby, but I hope that helped!

(Edit for clarity)(#11)Bronkaid helps.  It's a bronchodilator and it's over the counter.

Primatene is similar, but I haven't used it.

But these aren't immediate like an inhaler.(#12)There‚Äôs a pressure point on your palm by your thumb that helps with asthma attacks and better breathing for a bit that helped me if you need the link for me details I can send it(#13)[deleted](#14)Can the pharmacist fill the an emergency prescription for you? They just fill it under their name instead of a doctor. I have had mine do this for me a couple of times when I was out of medication and I couldn't get in to see my doctor.(#15)My youngest was first diagnosed with asthma at age 3. Asthma has a bad tendency to go very bad very quickly with small children. Someone else mentioned urgent care. I really would not hesitate to take her if you are not able to get a script filled. She may need to be on more than a rescue inhaler. Do you have an allergist that you could call if you can‚Äôt take her in? (Yes to the steamy showers-great idea, and we also wound up a few times having her drink lots of warm water, too- not age 3 but as she got a bit older). They are also nebulizers with a child-size mask that your physician could prescribe to keep on hand with Albuterol solution for times like this.(#16)Primatene mist is an otc inhaler. It is not ideal, but when you have nothing else it can help. It saved my life when I was completely out of albuterol and gasping for air. It relieved the tightness in my chest and allowed me to breathe but it also caused irritation and I ended up needing to take acetaminophen to relieve it. I told my pulmonologist about it and she said she‚Äôs fine with me taking it if I have absolutely nothing else, but stop using it I‚Äôve you have albuterol‚Äî theres nothing that can really replace it.(#17)I‚Äôm hoping this is all sorted now, but please in future go and get your daughter her medication by whatever means necessary (emergency docs, hospital, whatever). 

Struggling to breathe is exhausting and asthma attacks are even more terrifying and life threatening if you don‚Äôt have a reliever inhaler. Be more organised if you can and get an emergency spare.(#18)Note that for some people (including me, and one of my IRL friends), humidity is a trigger, and dry air would be better. If this is the case for her, a dehumidifier would help. 

Heat on her chest, like an electric heat pad. 

Caffeine. 

In the future, refill inhalers a bit early so you always have a spare. Also in situations like this, sometimes the pharmacist can ok a refill without the prescription, ask them about that.(#19)Note that for some people (including me, and one of my IRL friends), humidity is a trigger, and dry air would be better.

Really bad wheezing when lying down?,22,0.97,23,"(#1)Could be a dust mite allergy; mine always gets way worse in winter with the heating, and beds are prime spots for them.(#2)This could be GERD. It mimics asthma and often manifests while in a prone position.(#3)nocturnal wheezing is frequently due to GERD or post nasal drip.  allergy to something in the house/bed possible if it happens when not recumbent but in the room.(#4)This is very similar to me.

For me it gets gets awful during winter and or ac(#5)You might need to see a pulmonary specialist. They can conduct a sleep study that monitors your breathing while you are sleeping.

There is obviously something that isn't right.

All the best.(#6)Are you laying on your back? That squashes your lungs and side sleeping is better. A wedge pillow will also help lessen GERD type symptoms that may flare your asthma. And invest in a mattress & pillow cover if you don‚Äôt have already. As others say you are likely allergic to dust mite if bedtime makes it worse. Good luck identifying your triggers..(#7)I highly recommend N-Acetyl-Cysteine to better manage your asthma, it‚Äôs helped me so much. I went from using my inhaler daily, to now only using it a few times a month at most.(#8)Holy crap this is exactly what‚Äôs been happening to me every night since i caught covid about 6 weeks ago.(#9)Try sleeping in a chair and see if the same thing happens. If not, it's something to do with laying down.(#10)Before I was diagnosed with asthma my doctors thought i might have congestive heart failure from similar symptoms.     Not saying it is as the old saying goes if you hear hoofbeats expect horses not zebras so I'd suggest Gerd or allergies as the prime suspects.   Now you are an adult I'd go visit them again as you can stand up for yourself and explain clearly to the doctor what is happening,  take what you've written above and hand it to them if you're like me and get ""white coat amnesia"" when you brain freezes at the doctors.

You need a blood test, a doctor needs to test your IGE and esosiniphils.

"Can't breath, giving up on life.",70,0.94,82,"(#1)I'm sorry. I don't know if this is any comfort, but know this - if you went to the ER and you truly weren't breathing, they would be able to tell immediately and they would have multiple resources dedicated to figuring out why and treating you. I'm not saying this is your imagination - I had asthma for a year before it was diagnosed properly. I went to the ER multiple times in the span of a few months, and finally one of the triage nurses said something that stuck with me: ""if you're talking and forming complete sentences, then your breathing isn't an emergency"". 

What you're feeling is hell, keep advocating for yourself and trying to get treatment. But understand that as terrible as it feels, you will know it if your life is in danger.(#2)Take a anti-histamine, try to calm down, anxiety from not breathing makes the not breathing worse, go and get a pulse oximeter, just seeing high oxygen levels on a monitor can calm anxiety , sounds like that is part of the problem, control that before you can actually find the asthma symptoms and triggers(#3)My severe asthma was being exasperated by Apnea.   Nothing helped and we couldn‚Äôt figure it out until my cardiologist sent me in for testing.  I spent years suffering. 


I know it‚Äôs random, but that‚Äôs why I mention it to people.    It‚Äôs worth checking out, and if you don‚Äôt have traditional symptoms like extreme obesity and snoring they don‚Äôt check for it.


Edit: I‚Äôd hope/assume you‚Äôve been tried on a maintenance inhaler by now, and my comment is based more on if you‚Äôre still severe after that.   They also need to do blood testing.(#4)Do you take any maintenance inhalers? Your situation sounds a lot like the one I was in a couple of years ago right when COVID began. I was having horrible breathing issues and was having trouble sleeping. I went to the ER a few times, got a COVID test, got put on prednisone for a couple of days (which was temporary relief but ultimately didn‚Äôt work), took chest xrays and bloodwork that all came up clean. I then finally got put on Symbicort twice a day and finally felt some relief almost instantly. I‚Äôm confident that I also have GERD/Silent reflux which is common with asthmatics and can definitely take a toll on your breathing. Taking antacids before eating or proton pump inhibitors may help? It did for me at least. Best of luck with your situation.(#5)I felt this way for a couple of years before I started to make progress with the right medication. What really helped me in these situations were burst doses of Prednisone(#6)Not to sound like a dick however my medical training legit teaches us if they can Scream they can Breath so if you have a patient/causality claiming they can‚Äôt breath yet they can talk they can breath thus are lower priority if you got other wounded around.

Now to Sympathize with you.

I had covid in July of 2020 I ended up having difficulty breathing that went on for roughly 3 months I still got long term damage yet CT Scans say I‚Äôm fine. 

Since I had covid I can‚Äôt wear a basic issue Army IOTV without dying legit the weight on my chest since covid or really having any pressure on my chest results in me having breathing difficulties.

Im still trying to push to get that on file, thankfully I have my covid positive test on file and I got copies of my results so if studies in the future pop up finding more long term damage I have my VA claim.(#7)My worsening asthma ended up actually being structural issues with my airway. Ask your pulmonologist for a CT of your airway 

I'm not saying it's likely or what you have, but I was never aware this could be an issue until I had been diagnosed with tracheal stenosis. This isn't meant to scare you, just meant as something to look into(#8)Hey, I just wanted to tell you I was in your position. Horrible shortness of breath that nobody could help me with. I was even at a hospital being diagnosed for 2 weeks and nothing conrete was found and they sent me back with inhalers that weren't helping. But there is hope for you, even if it might feel there isn't. You just need the right diagnosis. don't give up hope. 

For me, LPR and h. pylori were most likely related to my symptoms and also anxiety. Could you describe how your shortness of breath feels like? Did you get a PFT done? what were the results? Sending you my sympathy in this difficult time.(#9)How long have you been feeling this way? What's your general location?(#10)You‚Äôre definitely not alone I‚Äôm right there with you(#11)Alright first of all you're alright brother! I've had severe Asthma my entire life! Listen to me when I say this, you can and will get through this!


Here are some options that might help: Talk to your pulmonologist (If you have one, otherwise I'd go setup an appointment with one). If you're like me my anxiety cause my asthma to act up really badly, so if you're worried about having Covid or worried about your overall health it's okay to be worried but you absolutely have to get a hold on this, cause I'm telling you, if you can't deal with this it'll only make things worse. If you're having a hard time getting a hold on this you should seek professional help.

I know this may sound harsh but I know you can do it! If you need any help, or need someone to talk to I'd be happy to talk! You got this!!

Edit: Also you may want to check out a functional medicine doctor! I have one and it's been super helpful!(#12)This is less of a ‚Äúthis is what might be wrong with you‚Äù and more of a ‚Äúthis will end‚Äù message. I have been on your situation (not asthma, but in constant pain and couldnt sleep and doctors less than helpful or hopeful and scared as hell). The best advice I got at the time was not from a medical Dr but a Psych- ‚ÄúDo not take a permanent solution to a temporary problem.‚Äù  Keep asking for help, keep looking for answers, be adamant with your doctors that where you are right now is not acceptable - something will eventually change, and someday this will be in your rearview mirror. I promise. (And yes - steroids take a while to work). If you have any friends or family to stay with you that can really help with the anxiety. 
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going through hell, keep going.‚Äù(#13)I'm really sorry to hear this. As someone who has had asthma all my life, until recently, it definitely sucks!!

One day I decided to stop eating sugar and bad carbs (wheat flour, white bread, corn starch, etc.) by trying out the keto diet. Within less than 2 weeks, I noticed that I didn't have to use my inhaler before I went to bed! I continued this diet for a year. I haven't used my inhaler since. 

So it could be things that you consume that can affect your lungs and breathing as well. Hope this helps! Please don't give upüôèüôè.(#14)What do you mean they don't try to help? Usually not being able to breathe is taken very seriously. Do you have asthma? Do yo have emergency inhaler?(#15)Have you been to an allergist / asthma doctor? Mine helped me tremendously.(#16)Been about four months now(#17)Please don't cry! It only makes it worse, I've been there.

When I was a kid, I had asthma attacks for days, couldn't run, couldn't have a normal life, but now I feel as if I have nothing to worry about. It was a mix of change of medicines and change of climate. You're desperate now, but it will pass.(#18)We are in this boat together guys! Don‚Äôt give up. I‚Äôve been there before. I‚Äôm currently struggling rn. We should start a colony for people who want to breathe clean air. No cars.(#19)Please do this ASAP .....

Do what you have to do, to get yourself checked for Pulmonary Sarcoidosis.

It is an auto-immune disease that affects the lungs. It does show up on MRI scans as clusters of cells in your lungs. Blood tests can also show up increases in calcium levels.

Uveitis or inflammation of the eyes is another indicator.

Sarcoidosis is notoriously difficult to detect as it takes on the symptoms of other diseases, depending on which organ it affects.

I have both Asthma and Pulmonary Sarcoidosis. If indeed you do have Sarcoid, it won't be easy in the months ahead, I have to warn you about that.

You must however, confirm or eliminate Sarcoidosis as a possible cause of your breathing problems.

Wishing you all the best.(#20)Don‚Äôt give up. Hopefully the new inhaler works(it took me ~2 weeks for my symbicort to start working). You can also ask your specialist if there is an immediate drug or inhaler they can provide until inhaler stereoids start working(hopefully it does).

If not I hope your persistence to see the doctor does not go away and eventually find the right treatment. It is hard to find a doctor who is invested in you but you shouldn‚Äôt give up. Keep in mind that your treatment and success may someday be the data required to treat someone else in your situation(so you are potentially helping others as well).
Good luck and hope you get back to normalancy soon(#21)I‚Äôve been feeling this way lately, just had an ER visit for asthma attack on Sunday. Prednisone is the only thing that helps me, and we all know those side effects. I‚Äôm hoping you can get the help you need. And you‚Äôre not alone.(#22)I am so so sorry you are going through this.  If you can afford it, buy a pulse ox. It gives me peace of mind when my anxiety starts to get aggravated from fear of an attack. It‚Äôs such an awful circle.(#23)It's the worst feeling in the world when you know there's something serious going on in your body and the whole medical field won't do anything to help you. I'm afraid I don't have much time left. In all honesty I feel like I don't want to do it anymore. I get nothing from Drs. It's like they really don't care how bad somebody is suffering. I've literally broke down crying begging them to help. I don't know why at this point they won't keep me for a couple nights and run some more test. I thought Drs were supposed to he there for you when you needed them? This world is so backwards and screwed up. What's the point of even being apart of it?(#24)I am sorry you are going through such a rough time.(#25)Your throat would feel it if you have Covid, I‚Äôm in the same position but nebulizer helps me sleep, maybe this will help put pressure on one side of your palm we‚Äôre your thumb is, for 30 sec to a couple of mins, a pressure point that makes it easier to breath,(#26)Might seem like not so much of a fix but I found that benadryl really helps me with my asthma(#27)I‚Äôm so sorry! I have eosinophilic asthma that appeared out of the blue when I was 41 and now is 95% controlled with Nucala, after I almost died in the hallway of my condo. I feel your pain and fear and hopelessness, and my heart goes out to you.  I know how scary it is. Don‚Äôt hesitate to call 911 or whatever number you have, the squeaky wheel get the grease.  Has anyone brought up biologics? I don‚Äôt know enough about you to say but I mention it because Nucala has been a miracle for me.

Anxiety can mess with your body in weird ways(#30)This might not be super helpful, but could it be anxiety related? I am finding a lot of my breathing problems get a lot worse with stress and anxiety, also my inhalers are not always effective.  I am still figuring out what to do with that information but since Ive started concentrating on relaxing parts of my body when trying to get a full breath or yawn it has been helpful. I've also gone in to the doctor only to be told its 'nothing.' It can feel so demoralizing and I am truly sad to hear you're going through this.  I hope you find relief soon!(#31)Really sorry you're going through this. I have gone through bad patches myself, and I know what it feels like to be so exhausted trying to breath and just giving in and going to sleep, not caring if I ever wake up again.

Things you can be doing right now: stop eating all processed foods, dairy, and grains and go on a strict AIP diet. This will dramatically reduce inflammation in your body. I know it's hard to advocate for yourself when you are going through hell, but it is critical you take charge and demand your doctors take all measures to get your breathing under control. Your doctors should be hitting this with everything at their disposal: oral steroids, high-dose antibiotics (z-pak), nebulizer treatments and experimenting with different LABA, LAMA, and ICS inhalers. If they aren't willing to explore these kinds of measures, fire them and get new doctors.

Best of luck to you. Hang in there, friend.(#32)My grandma has this. She's tried for her whole life to get a diagnose and found nothing that helps except living in a more humid warmer climate. However she's lived to be over 80 with her weak lungs, bad breathing, frequent coughing not caused by Covid or anything they can treat, and she's still completely independent.

You should keep going to DRs of course, not the ER, try different inhalers and also, remember that your HEART can cause symptoms that mimic asthma so you should also get that checked out.(#33)Have they given you a nebulizer?  Magnesium IV?  My asthmas severe and when in a crisis I usually need both treatments, not just an inhaler and a zpac.   I‚Äôve also needed extremely high doses of prednisone to control lung inflammation.   I‚Äôd go in to a different ER and see what they can do.  There‚Äôs nothing more miserable than slowly drowning in your own fluids.   At least trying can‚Äôt hurt.(#34)Have you tried the carnivore diet!?

This should do the trick! Eat meat, salt & water, that's all you have to do!

Don't give up!"
Not sure what happening to me all of a sudden.,5,1.0,34,"(#1)Is it possible there some anxiety mixed in here. Anxiety and panic attacks are similar to what we feel with asthma. I had a really bad attack a few months ago to where I was almost intubated. I had major anxiety after that and it caused me to have breathing issues.(#2)It's difficult to predict the course of asthma over time, but it sounds like you need to get a control inhaler like advair or symbicort.(#3)Side note: I‚Äôve been diagnosed with asthma since I was a child. My asthma has NEVER been this bad. Only once before when I had a bad brush of pneumonia but I took antibiotics and it cleared it right up but this time around nothing is wrong or different and it won‚Äôt stop.(#4)I know you said your blood work has been normal but in my case, I was always told my blood work was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when in fact, my eosinophils were elevated. I was just diagnosed with eosinophilic asthma and your story sounds somewhat similar to mine. Prednisone was the only thing that helped and once I was done with a course, I‚Äôd be right back to square one. Over using my albuterol inhaler, awful coughing fits. Do you have access to your blood work to see for yourself that everything is normal?(#5)Hi, 

I feel so bad that what you are going through and I literally writing this just after the flareup. My symptoms exactly like your, however, I am very sensitive to msg, or cheese and whenever I have anything has it, at night, I just started with tingling in my throat, and coughing nonstop, since Oct 2031, I had to beneryl, rescue puffer every night to help me sleep and fight the discomfort. But also, only worked for 2-3 hours and the flareups came right back 

A month ago, I started taking Symbicort (3times x 2 puffs) + 10 mg Singulair, it does seem working a bit, at least to control how severe of the asthma attack during night time but I am still monitoring myself on it to see if it actually helps me. 

I notice you do not use any type medication daily for your asthma except Prednisone. Please try to discuss with your GP the all the medication above if it is a good combination to put your asthma under control. 

I hope we can fight this together!!!!(#6)Not a doctor: 
But an allergist or pulmonologist can do a lung function test. That can help you see what's going on. An allergist could also do allergy testing. 

Based on one of your comments, it looks like your eosenophils are elevated. That indicates inflammation.

You could also have GERD (reflux) or an anxiety issue mixed in there. 

Asthma is also worse at night because of the way the body functions.(#7)You didn‚Äôt mention a preventative inhaler, are you on one? When I last had a weeks long flare up I doubled my dose of symbicort to 4 puffs a day and that helped.(#8)You just typed my life story. Samething happened to me starting end of 2020. NEVER had bad asthma until then. I found myself in the e.r once or twice every other month and it‚Äôs embarrassing. They would give the same treatment and so on. They keep telling me to see an allergist or pulmonologist but i haven‚Äôt because nothing has changed in my life other than gaining a few pounds. The only thing that has worked for me which i just started doing 2 weeks ago is using my advair like i am supposed to. After day two i noticed i was breathing fine and rarely needed my inhaler. You just have to stay consistent with it because they say it doesn‚Äôt fully work until two weeks in. Also nasal spray and coffee helps ALOT. If i do have a flair up which is usually when i wake up because for someone reason thats when my asthma is the worse i take a zyertec and im fine within the hour!

Also def mixed with anxiety too. I noticed that I was so traumatized by the few asthma attacks I did have where my boyfriend had to take me to the hospital I was sometimes thinking I couldn‚Äôt breathe when I would be by myself like driving to work but then As soon as I got to work it was like nothing ever happened. I noticed there are days or mornings where I could feel like I‚Äôm short of breath but I will meet my friends later and we go to the bar or some thing and I‚Äôm breathing just fine and not even thinking about an asthma attack. So it definitely plays a part.(#9)Same exact thing happened to me about 10 years ago. Would constantly wake up feeling tight in the chest. Often would suddenly wake with a start feeling like I cant breathe. This cycle would continue throughout the night. Went through this for probably a year. Finally figured out it was anxiety, and not my asthma at all. Was put on a small dose of escitalopram, and around the same time I also started a new, less stressful job, and I've been fine ever since. The whole time I was having these episodes, I would check my peak flow and blood oxygen levels and they were always fine, so I had a suspicion it wasn't actually my asthma."
I only have asthma when I laugh too hard?,5,0.86,6,"(#1)Yes, laughing can be an asthma trigger because it exacerbates the airways. It‚Äôs happened to me a very few rare times.(#2)Every time I have a good laugh, it turns into a coughing fit.(#3)Same here - laugh too hard and I'm paying for it with a coughing fit soon after(#4)Best advice I got for laughing and coughing is concentrate on breathing out.(#5)Same here ‚Äî every time I laugh really hard it aggravates my airways lol"
Feeling Alone,4,0.83,21,"(#1)Get a fish tank , and non flower  bearing plants with low maintenance like a water money plant(#2)If you have normal PFTs, you may not have asthma at all but simply allergies. Have you considered allergy shots?(#3)Lmao youre allergic to the cat man .. youre not gonna die from asthma if u get rid of the damn cat"
Cough variant,3,1.0,5,"(#1)I‚Äôve had cough variant for years.  Use the albuterol if you need it.  Don‚Äôt wait. You might try some delsym cough syrup and ask you doc if they can give a script for Tess skin pearls.(#2)Use albuterol when you‚Äôre coughing. If you‚Äôre using it 4 times a day or more, talk to your doctor about other meds. There‚Äôs always more meds options. You haven‚Äôt told us which didn‚Äôt work for you, so we can‚Äôt suggest others to try, but there are other types of meds besides inhalers too."
Singulair! ( Yes another one of these posts),6,0.72,24,"(#1)The only problem I had with Singulair was that it gave me vivid dreams and eventually didn't really seem to help with my symptoms at all.(#2)Hi I feel like I‚Äôm always repeating myself but I have anxiety and depresssion, I was prescribed Montelukast (singulair) a year ago after a bad asthma flare up. At the time I felt like I couldn‚Äôt leave the house at various periods due to pollen and I was also taking way too much albuterol. Anyway it was a magic bullet for me. After a couple of weeks where I had the odd mild headache- unusual for me so I felt that it was a symptom, then I settled right into it. No mental effects. Am actually much happier on it. Literally after taking the first pill I felt a little better 2 hours in. 1 week in and I couldn‚Äôt believe that I could breathe properly through my nose for maybe first time ever. I do feel maybe the benefit isn‚Äôt quite as strong a year in or maybe I‚Äôm just in the time of year my body hates and I would be 20x worse without it. Certainly I know it works well because if I miss a day then I start to feel the asthma creeping up again. As for mental effects I feel so much better than when I was puffing my rescue inhaler all the time. I sleep better, snore less, taste food better and look at my family in astonishment as they sneeze and sniffle though allergy season- I am barely affected now. I have my husband on watch for if I do get any changes from taking it. And I do find when I take it right before bed I dream more (taking 2-3 hrs before is ideal for me) but otherwise it‚Äôs a wonder drug for me and I hope you at least try it out.(#3)For me, singulair just made me feel like I was numb and my brain was outside of my body.(#4)I was afraid of the same thing, thinking ‚ÄúWhat if it makes me think irrational thoughts are rational and I do something insane.‚Äù 

I warned my partner to watch out for mood changes and what the side effects could be.

I‚Äôve been on it for a good 4-5 months and I‚Äôve been fine. Just pay attention to your thoughts and emotions.(#5)I‚Äôve been taking singulair for years and it helps my asthma‚Ä¶I have anxiety and depression but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs from singulair for me..I love singulair I can‚Äôt imagine to stop taking it(#6)Singulair gave me incredibly fucked up and vivid nightmares. Like things that made me wake up screaming. That being said it‚Äôs the best treatment I‚Äôve ever had for my asthma, I didn‚Äôt know how bad my asthma was until I took singulair and got to find out what the volume of an actual breath felt like. You know those videos where people get the color blind glasses and say ‚Äúthis is what you guys get to see all the time?!‚Äù That‚Äôs how I felt after a day or so of singulair ‚Äúyou guys get to breathe this much air all the time?!‚Äù. What worked for me is I take singulair first thing in the morning and it has worn off enough that I barely have any dream issues at all anymore and when I do they‚Äôre not terrifying they‚Äôre just like very realistic whereas if I took it at night they were terrifying. Part of me worries bc what the hell are these things doing if they‚Äôre capable of changing my dreams but on the other hand I can run with my kids outside and enjoy life without using a rescue inhaler 4-5 times a day in the worst of seasons. I‚Äôm using it like 4-5 times a month instead. Maybe consider taking it only when you know your allergies/asthma will be terrible. Like I‚Äôm seasonal, spring and fall are BRUTAL for me, middle of summer and winter I can do without it.(#7)You‚Äôll be fine. The first time around I had nightmares after maybe 5 days so I stopped taking them, I was in a very stressful period in my life. Recently I started taking them again and its been a year and I haven‚Äôt noticed anything different other than being able to breath better and use other medications less.(#8)I take singulair and it‚Äôs stopped me from having to take a steroid inhaler which I prefer. I‚Äôve had no noticeable side effects except if I forget to take it for a few days then the tightness in my chest creeps back up. It takes a bit to start working and takes a few days to wear off.(#9)I‚Äôve been on it for several years. No adverse mental health affects at all. I did think it was giving me very vivid and boring dreams but those stopped when I started Dupixent. I do see positive results in my night symptoms with Singulair.(#10)My daughter (15) is a severe asthmatic. She lasted 4 weeks on Singulair. She was somewhat psychotic and manic. I wish she could have stayed on it because it was helping. But she is doing well on Dupixent. You sound like a perfect candidate for Dupixent. Dupixent is now being used off label for esonophilic esophagitis as well as asthma and eczema. Amazing drug.(#11)I took Singulair for a year. I had no side effects. I also feel that it did nothing for me.(#12)I've been on Singulair since I was 10 and I can only say it's approved my life for the better. I'm 31yrs old now and take it daily.(#13)Singulair is a miracle drug for me. When I last ran out of it, I couldn‚Äôt even walk *down* a flight of stairs without coughing until I vomited. Zero side effects. 

Just try it. You‚Äôll know if it‚Äôs wrong for you.(#14)I‚Äôve taken singular for years now and it‚Äôs been a huge help.  I‚Äôve never of anyone going mental and I‚Äôve certainly never noticed a single side effect.(#15)Update for anyone who may be reading this with my same fears. 

So far so good, zero side effects aside from vivid dreams. However, the dreams so far have been awesome. I look forward to going to bed at night lol. 

Also, wondering if my breathing had something to do with my constant waking up in the middle of the night. I‚Äôve slept better than I have in 30 years since starting singulair."
Alcohol and Asthma?,0,0.5,3,"(#1)Alcohol is not a bronchodilator. When you're drunk, your body is not feeling sensations the way it is designed to. You are still having the exact same breathing issues but the alcohol deadens the sensation.(#2)I‚Äôve noticed the same effect. Probably has something to do with alcohol being a vasodilator.(#3)Having some beers or wine seems to make me feel relaxed and not bothered with asthma. Maybye it even helps a little bit. Hard liquor is a no no tho. It irritates airways. Btw I definately not advise to cure asthma with beer although it would be cool :D"
asthma is gone suddenly?,4,0.84,11,"(#1)Yup. I moved 1500 miles south of where I'd lived previously, to a subtropical climate. Symptoms vanished completely, I haven't needed to touch my inhaler in 3 years.(#2)I know every time I go on vacation to somewhere humid without sagebrush or any of the other desert plants, my asthma basically disappears. My lungs love the PNW when we go up there, I think it's the combo of the humidity keeping the dust and pollen down as well as the absence of most of my allergens up there.(#3)Living allergen free helps allergic asthma. Allergies can also disappear, and new ones may appear. From what I‚Äôve researched asthma does not disappear but is rather dormant/controlled when you are not  exposed to allergens(#4)You may have had allergic asthma and by controlling the allergens, you are no longer exposing yourself to triggers.(#5)Nothings ever really gone. it will be back, but this time u will be ready.(#6)It's call remission it'll rear its ugly head in the future.  No asthma symptoms for 10 plus year then wam(#7)Yes but after taking Nucala ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è(#8)Yes but it comes back eventually."
Did going on a preventative and stopping make my asthma worse?,8,1.0,12,"(#1)First of all, I'm sorry you lost your insurance and that medicines are so expensive. I can relate as I've gone through the same thing a couple times during my life. 

It's extremely unlikely that going on and off your meds made your asthma worse. It's more likely that because you had your asthma under control and could actually breathe well for once you are really noticing the difference now that it's not controlled again.

Your physical health absolutely has an impact on your asthma. I'm pretty out of shape right now and although my asthma is controlled it's definitely not as good as when I'm in good shape. Not to badger you about what you already know, but it's easier to get in shape when you're young and it's easier to stay in shape once you're in it  So take it from an older guy and get back on that train now if you can.(#2)You need to get back on a controller. Your lungs did NOT become dependent on the Qvar. What happened is the Qvar reduced the inflammation in your lungs that was causing your symptoms. When you quit taking the controller, the inflammation came back. The longer the inflammation goes untreated, the worse the damage to your lungs is going to be.

Talk to your doc about alternatives to Qvar and check GoodRx for prescription prices.(#3)Endogenous cortisol suppression is one of the major systemic side effects of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of asthma(#4)when I first went to the doctors with breathing problems they gave me 5 days worth of Prednisone and a month worth of Albuterol ...I needed Albuterol  every 5 to 6  hours or so and when I ran out I went to urgent care ....they told me a rescue inhaler should be used a few times a month not a few times a day and they gave me Fluticasone and I have not needed to use my rescue inhaler since then ...obesity is a risk factor for the development of asthma, and asthma may increase the risk of developing obesity  not sure if it's the chicken or the egg or unrelated because I'm not a doctor all wow I drink too much"
Throat tightness,5,0.86,17,"(#1)Inhalers in general are really rough on the throat.  

You might do some research on vocal cord dysfunction, it‚Äôs a separate condition from asthma.(#2)Get checked out for GERD on LPR. Like myself, many other asthma sufferers have found that reflux issues can often play a major role during flare ups. The tightness you feel may be irritation from reflux as opposed to asthma or a combination of both.(#3)This happens to me. I feel like my throat is closing up.(#4)I have this same issue. I think it's from the advair but am still investigating.(#5)Get your eosinophill levels checked. I suffer from eosinophillac asthma and it is one of the symptoms.(#6)Same thing here. So odd(#7)it would feel like someone was strangling me anytime I was around tobacco smoke ......thought I was going crazy turned out to be asthma.....my dad smoked my whole premature life  and all my friends smoke(#8)I have this problem from MCAS. My MCAS loves to interact with my asthma a lot too. I see an allergist and he has helped a lot with this."
I just got diagnosed with asthma,5,1.0,19,"(#1)Asthma is a chronic condition that, yes, is typically treated with a baseline treatment of inhaled corticosteroids for the rest of your life. If you leave it untreated, the chronic inflammation process in your lungs can cause permanent lung damage. Untreated asthma can also kill. I'm not saying that to scare you, but to let you know the risks of not taking the prescribed maintenance meds.

As far as the mouth-rinsing after use goes: You have both bacteria and fungi in your mouth. That's normal, and usually they're balanced out so neither causes problems. Now steroids kill off bacteria (and don't distinguish between good and bad bacteria), and can throw off the healthy balance between bacteria and fungi in your mouth, causing a fungal infection called ""oral thrush"". This isn't usually a big problem and can easily be treated, but it's uncomfortable and can be pretty painful. To prevent that, you're told to wash out your mouth after inhaling your steroids in order to wash out any residue of steroids in your mouth (and you WILL get residue in your mouth--using a spacer with your inhaler can minimise this, though). A lot of people never get oral thrush from inhaled steroids as long as they inhale properly and wash their mouths out afterwards, while some do get it sometimes.

As someone who's had both oral thrush before, and stints with uncontrolled asthma (due to not being allowed to take any steroids for a while), I'll gladly take the risk of oral thrush instead of going without my maintenance inhaler again.

So to answer your concrete question: YES, you should try out the inhaler your doctor prescribed (she should have also given you a rescue inhaler to use for acute symptoms, not just the maintenance inhaler that you take daily, though--budesonide is a corticosteroid aka maintenance inhaler). If you don't start feeling better/have fewer acute problems, you need to go back in to discuss switching to a different med or upping the dosage as some of us need to try a few different meds or dosages until we find the right maintenance medication.

Also, very important: DO NOT JUST STOP YOUR MAINTENANC MEDS IF YOU'RE FEELING BETTER! This doesn't mean your asthma is gone, it only means your meds are working as intended. If you suddenly quit your maintenance meds, your asthma symptoms will usually just come back until you go back on maintenance meds. These meds will not ""wear out"" your respiratory system. They are supporting your respiratory system to work as intended.

As for your fear of becoming dependent on asthma meds: Unfortunately, that's in the nature of asthma. A chronic illness usually means being dependent on meds to control said illness for the rest of your life. But you will not ""become"" dependent, you ""are"" dependent now since you have asthma. This is not something that starting the meds will cause; it's something that you having asthma causes. Most asthmatics can live a more or less normal life with the right meds, though.(#2)You won't get scars in your mouth if you don't rinse after using inhaler. You will get candida or more commonly called thrush. Which you solve with antibiotics. But if you rinse every time you probably won't have any issues. Maybe a little bit sore throat.

You also won't start to be dependent on medication. It's not addictive. What can help is that you feel awesome on medication after some time, so you want to stop using it. If you stop using it your symptoms will come back.

Are you kidding me? Sorry? Hell no. It literally saved me from choking. Also I can actually breathe. Before inhaler I was wheezing like Stevie kid from show. Now I can breathe and talk normally.

Off topic: I changed my meds recently and with new inhaler I am even better than I was. Before my peak flow was 450 on best days. Since I started my new inhaler I can blow almost 500. That is actually really good!(#3)Using the maintenance medication will not make you dependent on the medication or make your asthma worse. On the contrary, it‚Äôs pretty common for a doctor to start you out on a higher dose medication initially, then drop you down when your asthma is better controlled. That said, guidance that came out a few years ago suggests that most people should be stay on maintenance meds, and should not ‚Äústep‚Äù down to relying on rescue meds alone. 

I have been on asthma meds for about 6 or so years now, and have never gotten thrush. As long as your once your mouth out after using your maintenance inhaler, you should be ok. I try to since my mouth out after using my rescue inhaler too, but that‚Äôs not as important (your rescue inhaler is not a steroid) and is obviously not always possible.(#4)Asthma medication is not addictive, it's one of those things that you should be dependant on because (not to scare you) it can save your life. Untreated asthma can be really dangerous.

Your medication will not give you scars either, from my understanding it's got more to do with the health of our teeth, it looks like the inhaler you mentioned is a daily inhaler so if that's the case you should probably take it before you brush your teeth if you can.

I only have only had bad experiences with two asthma medications, the first one was regular Albuterol (rescue inhaler) which messed with my heart rate but with that I just switched to Xopenex (rescue inhaler), the second was Singulair (pill) I believe which increased anxiety and so I switched to Symbicort (daily inhaler), both of these negative side effects are dependant on the person though and it's impossible to find any medication without possible negative side effects. 
Basically if you do fall upon any problems with your asthma medication discuss it with your doctor, that way you can find something that works best to help you manage your symptoms.(#5)The medication works great, it won't make you dependant and if you use it regularly your breathing will improve a lot. I use it and the only side effect I had was bruising easily for a while, but that went away in a few months."
"I ran in the cold several days ago, but my asthma remains worsened?",4,1.0,12,"(#1)Cold-induced asthma. Masks are in abundance, so I would use one for this today. Pre-pandemic I wrapped a scarf/buff around my mouth to prevent cold-triggered asthma attacks.(#2)Running in the cold made mine flare up, too. That being said, whenever I start running after a break, my asthma flares up for a bit until I'm used to it again; so I think I can improve with training. 

I'm sure you haven't done permanent damage. It's up to you if you want to try easing into running in the cold or decide it's not for you. 

Good luck and feel better! :)(#3)Typical. Sometimes it takes me up to a week to recover after running in the cold. Steam showers help.(#4)After a hard run, especially in the cold I find my lungs are a little more sensitive to everything. 


I wouldn't worry to much but if you don't start feeling better check with your doctor.(#5)I can't run in the cold because it throws off my breathing for a few days, then I go back to normal (but only after a lot of rest). I imagine you're having a flare up, but if it is really concerning I would go to your doctor.(#6)I myself have asthma more often in hot and humid weather, but my sister always gets it in the cold and snow. Even as children as she ran around in the yard playing in the snow, she‚Äôd have to use her inhaler. As an adult she still the same way. Some people are just more affected by the cold than the warmer temperatures.(#7)It has nothing to do with the cold if it's going a week later. Sounds like you are simply having a flare up. Go see your doc.(#8)Could be sick(#9)Cold air has always given me a flare up, and I would say I'm pretty well controlled on my steroids. The cold, dry air hitting your lungs during exercise is a huge irritant. I would suggest a scarf or baklava over your nose and mouth to help warm and humidify the air you're breathing when you run, and make an appt with your doctor if your flare continues. I've always found a round or two of the nebulizer tends to nip my flares in the bud, if you have one. Good luck!(#10)Thank you all so much! This was really helpful. Will be posting again, great community."
i am so tired of inconsiderate smokers,81,0.9,26,"(#1)I had to go back on a two-week taper from prednisone to get mine under control in December. I live in a multi-unit building that allows smoking. I am vaped night and day. One neighbor just lit up. They vape scents that smell like some stinky, perfumed incense and my one neighbor vapes one that smells like a cigar. 

I really hate it. The condo board doesn‚Äôt want to pursue turning it into a no-smoking building. It is a real problem. I think about families that have babies breathing in this stuff. 

Not healthy for humans.(#2)Vaping is just as bad.

When I used to live in ski country, I always kept my face covered on the chairlift. Perfume/cologne is a huge trigger for me and the face covering kept me from having to breathe some cloying scent.(#3)Sadly there are a lot of jerk behaviors associated with smoking. Most of us don't care if you want to smoke, but just don't be the dick that blows it at someone. I was a social smoker in college, but I never flicked my cigarette butts out the window of my car. I see people do that all the time and it makes me so mad. The Earth is not an ashtray people!!(#4)I used to smoke (I don't anymore) but I always tried to be super cautious when around other people. We had a smokers table outside of a job I had, ashtrays on it and everything. Some lady decided to sit there with her infant ( instead of the other  empty ables) so I walked around her to go somewhere else and kept at least 50 feet away because the baby. She still screamed at me.(#5)Vape is pretty bad for some people too. I think it's actually worse for me than cigarette smoke, partly because people do feel like they can use it anywhere. I'm allergic to soy and I think I react to the glycerin in vapes.(#6)The bane of our existence. They (and antivaxers, ofc) are why I had the intuition covid was gonna be worse than an uphill battle.

What I did? 3M reusable mask. If you are a guy, shave your face. Use p100 filters (p95 would be OK for other non-smoking situations, but you probably know that smoking emits some of the most difficult  particles). I don‚Äôt go out without my mask anymore, and was actually using one *even before covid started*, as I live in a very polluted city and my asthma was getting incrementally worse each winter, which is when it‚Äôs colder and more polluted.  I love my mask ‚ù§Ô∏è.(#7)It isn't mean. Everyone knows that smoking causes cancer and that 2nd hand smoke is much more dangerous. Anyone that has had any symptoms from wildfire smoke which is many miles away from them can deduce that the toxins in cigarette smoke travel further than the puffs they see dissipate right out of their mouth. If they bother thinking, people can also know that they continue to exhale the stuff for several minutes after their last puff before they go inside somewhere and that the residue on all of their stuff is harmful as well. Smokers are addicts, most just won't consider logic and proven facts. Have you tried wearing a gaiter, I've seen cyclists wearing them and think there must be something that would work for skiers. Even before covid people were engaging in sports in harsh enviornments that made face covers necessary (smog, vog, fires) so I'd think there would be cool looking options.(#8)Smokers have no self-respect, so they can hardly be expected to show respect toward anyone else, let alone anyone with serious respiratory problems.

Unfortunately, that is how it works. ü§¨(#9)I hate them too"
Does anyone in this thread have asthma but never coughs or wheezes?,18,1.0,32,"(#1)I hardly ever wheeze, never have. Used to cough a lot with my asthma when I was younger but nowadays I also don't cough that much/often.

It sucks, really, when most doctors just listen to your lungs, don't hear wheezing, and dismiss you as ""not having asthma"" (even though my asthma has been proven twice without a doubt by pulmos, the second time by a pulmo who also didn't want to believe I had asthma before doing a trigger test).(#2)you're not alone. I never wheeze and never cough. When I go to the ER they look at me like I'm crazy. I get horrendous chest tightness and shortness of breath when mine flares up. All while having normal O2 and peakflow readings. Very frustrating.(#3)I don't really get wheezing but shortness of breath and cough plus chest pain sometimes. But mainly from exercise and allergies. I have mild asthma. I think I might have either lactose intolerance or mild milk allergy... I've been noticing I get shortness of breath when I consume milk and creamer mainly but not really yogurt, cheese, or butter. I do have food allergies though to other things. Weather definitely affects me.(#4)Yep. I don't know how to describe my flare-ups besides saying that it's almost like my body forgets to breathe? And I'm sitting there trying, but my chest just WON'T.(#5)Me! I get pain and struggle breathing but no sounds come with it.(#6)I don‚Äôt wheeze nor do I cough (only sometimes). I do have some phlegm though(#7)Cough variant asthma.  It blows traditional/ textbook asthma out of the field of diagnostic. 

My son who showed no wheezing,  slightly lowered oxygen level, only tightness of breath and fast respiration. 

He coughed so hard he vomited and passed out, I couldn't bring him to for almost 10 minutes. I had to push ER for an x-ray because they believed it was an anomaly. 

His asthma was exacerbated from RSV , and he's now developed bronchiolitis twice since.  We only knownthis because of the x-rays. He is not supposed to be vulnerable at his age, but he is. They say he's fine , but he's not.

The lack of wheezing makes this incredibly tricky to handle at home and clinic. I have to rely on my intuitive senses since overheating,  extreme moods, bad air quality and allergens set him off.

We both do this allergic type cough like cat dander is causing the tickles. We don't have a cat lol. But it's the sensation that induces a coughing fit and the inflammation builds up.

Preventative is absolutely necessary all year long for us, no matter if there are symptoms.  Flare ups always happens when we fall off for 4-6 days..I keep the nebulizer ready since we are okay and 2 minutes later, he can't get one breath in or out.(#8)I never wheeze but sometimes have a nighttime cough. I only experience tightness in my chest which is caused by over breathing or some air conditioning or heating systems.(#9)Me. Never Wheeze or cough.. just get short of breath at times and congestion or mucus in chest.(#10)Just shortness of breath. I only wheeze when it‚Äôs really bad.(#11)I wheezed and coughed ALL DAY EVERY DAY as a kid (seriously, watching home movies of me as really sad, lol), but as an adult it‚Äôs just a chest tightness and shortness of breath.  No coughing, no wheezing.(#12)I've had chronic asthma from the age of 3. I never wheeze or cough which has lead to my GP dismissing my concerns when I've tried to get prednisolone or ventolin for my nebuliser. Luckily I have a really good asthma nurse who decided to refer me to a consultant specialist and after multiple lung function tests my diagnosis has now changed to uncontrolled severe asthma. I experience tightness in my throat and chest and feelings of being smothered on a daily basis and I always get light headed and my fingertips turn blue when a big attack is imminent. This has been put in my medical notes in bold so everyone can see but I still get push back from my GP saying ""well I can't hear any wheezing.""(#13)I cough but have never wheezed. Not all asthmatics experience the same symptoms, even though many think you must wheeze (or cough) to have asthma. I was in California a few years ago for a wedding, and had a nurse practitioner question my asthma diagnosis because I didn‚Äôt wheeze, despite me having an attack literally in front of her at an urgent care clinic. Ended up in the ER via ambulance 2 days later because that NP refused to give me prednisone to help my lungs (she thought I‚Äôd get addicted?!?) and I stopped breathing. I ended up having asthmatic bronchitis and got the right help, including prednisone, at the ER. Needless to say, when I got home, my allergist was pretty pissed when I told her about all that - she couldn‚Äôt believe a medical professional didn‚Äôt know that not all asthmatics wheeze.(#14)I rarely wheeze. To the point that ER docs won't believe me if I go in for an asthma attack i can't get controlled. But pft shows I do. My doctors mostly just listen for clear lung sounds because I get sick super easy and it almost always goes to my chest and gives me bronchitis(#15)I have severe allergic asthma and on biologic injections and I never start with a cough. I usually start with chest tightness, shortness of breath and a burning feeling in my lungs. I assume from the mucus and restricted airways but eventually start to cough sporadically. But it‚Äôs never just a full blown cough or wheezy noise. I fee like (some, but not all) non asthmatic people think we have to be coughing to feel like we‚Äôre having an attack. I have noticed that even when I have flare ups I don‚Äôt really talk that much and I tend to stay really quiet for a few days because all I can think about is getting my lung health back and hoping I don‚Äôt have to go to the ER or use my EpiPen!  Stay healthy!(#16)no wheezing and minimal cough for me. i get chest tightness and general difficulty breathing. my peak flow is basically constant unless im really not doing well, but the difference is sometimes it's REALLY difficult to hit my number, versus sometimes its quite easy (when im healthy).  


it makes for tricky convos with docs sometimes(#17)Yes never, believe it's called ""silent chest disease"""
Smoking weed and asthma?,15,1.0,48,"(#1)If you are scared, try a microdose of an edible. You don't have to worry about inhaling smoke. Just remember doing edibles is extremely potent and should be done with care.(#2)Oof yeah smoking makes my chest hurt hella bad. I highly recommend trying edibles. I‚Äôve personally had the best luck with D8 when it comes to anxiety; it should be legal everywhere in the US. r/Delta8 has a masterpost of reputable online stores if you want to give it a shot! 

Only downside to THC is it definitely can up mucus production a bit. I try to stay away from it if possible
during allergy season.(#3)I have asthma and i smoke carts and dabs occasionally if i have ny rescue inhaler nearby and i smoke flower all the time. It is pretty easy to tell when i'm just not having a good day for breathing and i just don't smoke those days.(#4)After 2 years of heavy smoking made my asthma really bad I recommend edibles especially rso oil(#5)I smoke and have asthma. As long as I stick to my advair, I‚Äôm usually okay. Cartis hurt more than green in the long run. ~~Induction~~ Convection** vapes are the easiest on my lungs. 

Clean your bongs all the time. Way more often than the average stoner. Clean, rinse and use super cold water/ice. 

Don‚Äôt smoke spliffs or anything wrapped in tobacco papers. Keep your rescue nearby if you‚Äôre smoking a j. 

Don‚Äôt let your friends push you to smoke more than your lungs can handle. 

Keep a glass of water nearby.(#6)I vape CBD for pain and don't have any asthma trouble from it.  It might be something to look into.(#7)If it is legal in your state I‚Äôd consult with your doctor. I don‚Äôt think anyone here can give you a universal answer. Not everyone‚Äôs asthma reacts to the same things but if you are worried about it try starting with small increments and working up. I‚Äôd stress taking to your doctor though as they may also have an idea as well.(#8)I would definitely recommend using another form of THC. Smoking period is bad for your lungs, but smoking with asthma is VERY BAD for your lungs.(#9)Had asthma since birth. 

Smoking weed since high school. In my 30‚Äôs now. There are good days and bad days with my asthma still but my anxiety is under control(#10)i am not a dr and of course do what is right for you but i have smoked always with asthma when it was well controlled and when it wasnt . but if youre not an exsperianced smoker weed might make your anxiety worse . id start low and slow to see how it goes **  also the high u get from edibles will much higher then flowers , again start low and slow edibles take longer to wear off(#11)I vape using a Pax 3 and asked my doctor if it was ok.... she told me if weed was triggering my asthma I would not be using it.(#12)I do! Honestly just do small doses and know your limits. My breathing is usually a lot clearer when I smoke but you have to remember that even tho it's clear while you're high you are still smoking and it will have an affect. You have to keep up with your meds and make sure you stop smoking every once and a while and give yourself a break. If it's medicinal weed try using edibles and oils more often than smoking flower. Ik smoking can be fun but you have to watch your health. The oils and edibles have also helped my asthma. It's weird but it kinda breaks up the mucus in my throat and my throat feels more open. Your asthma comes first!!! Don't ignore your breathing. I realize that my response is very different than everyone else's but that's just my experience. I do not recommend and vape, they hurt and kinda burn up your throat.(#13)Yeah. I sometimes vape flower. That‚Äôs not too bad. I love my bong but try not to use it too much. When I do use it, I put ice in with the water. It cools the smoke down and it is gentler. Edibles are obviously the best being lung neutral but not my favorite.(#14)Been smoking on and off for 20+ years, you'll know when your lungs are feeling good enough to vape/smoke. Get yourself a dynavap and a glass bubbler and add cold water, just cools the vapor and makes it less harsh on the lungs... 

Edibles are your friend, just dont go too deep.

AVOID TOBACCO AT ALL COSTS!(#15)I got a conduction vaporizer (it bakes ground weed, no combustion involved) to cope with pain issues (I can't stomach edibles, sadly)

This won't be everyone's experience, but I have never breathed better. To be fair, my doc grossly mishandled my asthma and my parents used to chain smoke cigarettes indoors. I was always on the cusp of an asthma attack. Using a vape has made me learn to breathe properly (evidently NOT a skill I had learned) and I pace myself a lot better in bad weather.

I know it's not a great long term solution but I am in 24/7 pain that the doc can't figure out and have never had a positive effect from pain pills (they mess with my head and don't touch the pain, no clue if it's because of the type of pain or if I just can't tolerate the meds) so I'm hoping down the line I can quit, but for now weed is stitching me together lol

If it's mainly anxiety I strongly recommend CBD oil or, like I said, conduction vape. You barely notice when it takes effect, but if you tolerate CBD well it's WONDERFUL. Only negative experience I've known anyone to have with CBD was my SIL passes out when she takes it, but to be fair she has severe inflammation issues so it's her body getting a break and going into rest mode(#16)I have been smoking with asthma for 6 years, i do wheeze sometimes depending on how i inhale. If the smoke gets stuck in my throat and irritates my lungs then i use an inhaler, but usually i just cough it out. It‚Äôs very rare that smoking irritates my lungs though, i went three years without needing it even with basketball and swim in high school. Avoid carts, flower only and avoid pipes because they‚Äôre harsh üëç(#17)My allergist says that smoking anything is terrible for your lungs, including weed. It might not feel bad in the moment but smoke can cause scarring that builds up without you being aware of it. Lungs are a place where you absolutely do not want scarring. Why not try edibles instead.(#18)do pot cookies, don't smoke. strong pot with high THC can chuck some peoples peace of mind out the window.(#19)depends which strain you smoke and how üíÄ"
Brutal Winter,6,0.88,9,"(#1)Yes, the few really cold weeks followed by crazy fluctuations in temperatures in my area have really bothered my lungs and aggravated my asthma. I had a rough few rounds of sinus infections in the fall due to my allergies which also made it worse. I bought a humidifier and air purifier that seem to help when I run them regularly, but if I forgot to refill the humidifier for overnight or don‚Äôt run the purifier consistently I end up super congested and that also makes my asthma worse. I‚Äôm hoping the spring is kinder since I‚Äôve been getting allergy shots and upped my inhaler dose, but it‚Äôs no guarantee(#2)I'm struggling with the changes in weather tbh more this winter, I have an infection atm was in hospital today for it because I nearly fucking died ..fun lol .. yeah it's strange huh.. I feel like ever since covid came along.. my asthma is worse.. probably because it fucks your lungs long term.. have you seen the scans where it looks like there's glass shards in your lungs.. yea, like that!(#3)I am also getting virus after virus. Once I also developed pneumonia. I feel like it really affected my asthma as well(#4)I have humidifiers in every room of my apartment and in the office and I swear they‚Äôre the only thing keeping me alive(#5)I'm in Texas the past 2 to 4 years are bad.  The temperature swings mess with my asthma and eczema.  I FEEL LIKE A FREAK.  On top of everything. I got covid in July and in January.  Dealing with all this my sleep apnea is worse.  And don't forget I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder.  Sometimes I say.  God. If you want just take me.  But just take one day at a time.  Manage your symptoms.(#6)Yup. Got Covid with no symptoms. However, ever since, my asthma has been significantly worse.(#7)Are you wearing a high quality kn95/n95 mask in public? Are your vitamin D levels good? I haven‚Äôt caught a respiratory virus in 2 years, and I used to catch a lot of respiratory viruses."
"What are these ""standard"" questions asking about?",2,1.0,5,"(#1)The lists include any amount of symptoms, no mather how minor they might seem. They give you doctor an idea on how bad your asthma is in your day to day life. This is nice, because if you're anything like me, people with asthma sometimes show no symptoms during a checkup at a doctor or pulmonologist. 

I'm not sure what the scales are in your version, mine are always 0-5. You have to decide for yourself how severe you experience things. For me 0 means I have no symptoms at all. If I have to start avoiding things or sitting down during housework, I'll write down a 1 or 2 for interfering with daily activities for instance. If I can't do them at all because my symptoms are so bad it's a 5.

Now for the nighttime one, I think this refers to waking up because of your asthma. My form also has questions like ""how bad is your asthma in the morning"" etc. If yours doesn't have that but you experience bad symtoms at night or waking up, you should score it at the nighttime question. 

If it keeps being unclear to you, you can also ask your doctor to clarify the form.(#2)The questionnaire is to evaluate whether your asthma is in control. Based on what you have said here, your asthma is not in control.

Nighttime means when you're in bed sleeping."
What happens if you drink water or swallow saliva immediately after using inhaler?,2,1.0,17,"(#1)I was told to drink water and wash my mouth out after using my inhaler because if you don't, it can cause oral thrush so.. I've not had any side effects to doing it, but if I don't do it, I get dry mouth, which is expected and v common(#2)Apparently there are side effects. Talk to your doctor. On a personal note I have been using an inhaler, recuse and steroid for years. I have never known any of the rules like don't drink water after using it. I have used my inhaler over 100 hits in a week before during a bad time and I have never noticed any issues. I wouldn't panic. But always talk to your doctor if you have concerns.(#3)Rescue inhaler won't do anything bad, daily controller inhaler will give you thrush, which is painful and gross.(#4)I'm not sure which inhaler you used so I'm going to just cover a couple things.

Rescue inhalers like albuterol, can cause a fast heart rate. You do not need to rinse your mouth after using it and it doesn't matter if you swallow anything after using it.


You need to rinse your mouth (I brush my teeth) after using maintenance inhalers if they have steroids in them. They can thrush which is a yeast infection in your mouth if you don't. Don't worry about swallowing saliva in the time between inhalers and rinsing. You should be waiting a minute between inhaler puffs, I have never been told to spit during that time and I have never gotten sick.(#5)Been using rescue and maintenance inhalers for over 40 years. Never heard of this. Only thing I can think, is that you should rinse and spit after using to prevent thrush. I usually brush my teeth after my twice daily doses. I def don't worry about swallowing saliva or drinking water. In fact I always drink 16 oz of water in the morning after I take my meds. Nothing to do with my meds, just like to drink a tall glass if water in the AM lol.(#6)Thrush is the primary side effect of concern with inhaled steroid inhalers. Thrush is a fungal infection which can cause white patches or sores in your mouth. Rinsing or gargling with water can reduce the risk of this side effect. I think a lot of asthmatics have used their inhaler from time to time without rinsing or gargling and been no worse for wear. YMMV.(#7)Fast heart rate is a possible side effect either way, I believe. It's always been an issue for me no matter what I do.(#8)I have not rinse and spit. I just have a spacer with no issues.(#9)omg i‚Äôve been wondering about this for years aha(#10)Every inhaler has different side effects, but especially rescue inhalers are known for causing a racing heartrate.

Swallowing water or saliva shouldn't be that much of a problem. As far as I know this is more a thing to prevent corticosteroids from anti inflammatory inhalers to enter your blood. In the long run that could cause osteoporosis. With inhalers the steroids only get into your lungs, where they have to be. After rinsing your mouth they are less likely to enter your blood. 
Rinsing your mouth after using any inhaler is advised, because it removes the leftover meds from your mouth, this also protects your teeth from decay. 

Because what happened to you, only happened once, it's possible that's it's just a coincidence. If it happens multiple times and you're worried about it, you can ask your doctor about it."
Stress induced asthma symptoms,2,0.75,6,"(#1)I do too. I have mild asthma but I get issues mainly from stress, period, emotions, weather, smoke, weather in general, food allergies and hay fever.(#2)You've described 2 very different things here. Were you stressed at Coachella..?
What're your mild symptoms? I would seek medical advice regardless of what you think is causing it, they can run tests to determine that and that can change your behaviours to help prevent symptoms from becoming worse over time :)(#3)Stress is also one of my triggers.
What are your symptoms?(#4)Are you sure that it's not anxiety causing the symptoms? Anxiety is not uncommon if you feel stressed and anxiety mimics asthma.

As far as Coachella, bad air can interfere with just about everyone's ability to breathe.(#5)I feel you . thats one of my triggers as well . if stress thats the better of you it can cause a huge flare up so its best to have a preventative inhaler"

Allergist just put me on Pulmicort,1,1.0,10,"(#1)Pulmicort is the corticosteroid budesonide and Flovent is the corticosteroid fluticasone. So just different steroids some people respond better to one or the other. 

Personally I have never done well one fluticasone. Budesonide is my jam though.(#2)I've been using pulmicort and bricanyl since I was like 5 and I'm now in my 20s they're usually a little more expensive at least where I live and its generally better than more generic things like salbutimol which can causes palpitations etc  you'll be fine on it, in my experience it works brilliantly not sure what you're worried about in particular??"
Doctor added Spiriva to my Symbicort,5,1.0,9,"(#1)Recently was prescribed it as well, its absolutely amazing but for a while REALLY dried out my throat.

 make sure you stay very hydrated and gargle water as long and as far back as you can(#2)I love that inhaler works well(#3)I know Spiriva is pretty expensive. I just switched to Breztri from symbicort and Spiriva. It has the same class of drugs of both in one inhaler and so far is working great for me, at a lesser cost. Just throwing that out there if the prescription cost is crippling as much as it was for me.

I'm glad it's working for you!(#4)what is it ? its' not a steroid or a rescue ? 

I wonder if this will work for me."
Does straight saline through a nebulizer help loosen phlegm?,4,0.75,9,"(#1)Yup.

Subsiding symptoms.,3,0.8,9,"(#1)You may have anxiety along with the adhd rather than asthma. Anxiety can manifest with asthma type symptoms.(#2)I am about to start adderall for adhd too and I actually just started having symptoms that are similar to asthma recently. I also have anxiety attacks. I‚Äôll keep u updated on how I feel after starting adderall since I will most likely be doing that before I can get an inhaler. I feel like I‚Äôm suffocating sometimes but not all the time. It‚Äôs scary..(#3)Wow, that‚Äôs crazy! Maybe your psychiatrist or pulmonologist (if you have one) knows why. It would be interesting to know how the lung function is now. If you find out why it helps, i would be interested to know. 

Did the inhalers not help? And what were your symptoms that are better now?(#4)I have not looked up any actual research to back these things up, so please take all this with a big grain of salt.

I have no idea on the inhaler only working a short time, but I've heard that ADHD meds has some positive affects on people due to the vasoconstriction that the medications cause, making it have some bronchodilation effects. That also makes it help with nasal congestion.
One of the original purposes of amphetamines was to treat asthma but the doses needed for asthma caused too many side effects. 

As a personal anecdote, I started taking strattera a day before I used my Albuterol inhaler and nasal sprays for the first time. My breathing felt the clearest it had ever been and it felt like my breaths hit the back of my throat/sinus cavities for the first time in my life."
My 2 year old had an asthma attack we believe is due to the recent paint job we had done. I desperately need answers because we‚Äôre scared,13,0.86,19,"(#1)Seems like a really bad idea to be staying in a place with so many paint fumes drying. Not sure about the hotel coverage, but health is top priority, so it will be worth it regardless if it‚Äôs covered.(#2)Paint really sucks for asthma because of Volatile organic compounds. Basically it's the chemicals that paint (and other things) releases as it dries and even for years after. It's not good for anyone, but can be an asthma trigger. 

You can by low or no VOC paint, it's expensive but really worth the money. My husband and I repainted our house and not only was I able to help, but I was able to comfortably stay in the house after.(#3)Keep the place really aired out.  You may not be able to live there for awhile.  In the future use only low VOC paint.  A high capacity air purifier with a chemical filter... typically activated charcoal may help.(#4)If you have friends or family you can stay with them, because paint smell can be pretty triggering even few days after the paint dried.

Your kid definitely shouldn't stay at your house if it had breathing problems.(#5)As someone who has worked in the HVAC industry for years, and has also been treated for asthma, I can only tell you, stay as far as possible from paint, glue, and small particles that occur during work, metal dust, wood dust, etc.

The day I stopped working with it my lungs pounded.

If your child develops asthma, in addition to the therapy recommended by the doctor, I advise you not to smoke at home ever, remove carpets, use parquet or laminate, as few things as possible to collect dust, clean dust regularly, take your son to allergy test, so-called skin prick test, also called a puncture or scratch test, checks for immediate allergic reactions to as many as 50 different substances at once. This test is usually done to identify allergies to pollen, mold, pet dander, dust mites, and foods. In adults, the test is usually done on the forearm.

I discovered quite late that I was allergic to mattress mites, once they almost killed me in my sleep. Move your son from freshly painted walls for at least one week.(#6)did they sand the painting area as well ? that can very well trigger asthma .(#7)My asthma is affected for up to a week with paint fumes so if it‚Äôs just 1 room I stay out of it and we keep the door closed and window open when we‚Äôre at home for several days. If it‚Äôs the whole house I go stay somewhere else. My mum has been complaining about not be able to paint whilst I‚Äôve been home but didn‚Äôt want me to go anywhere else because if covid so we just haven‚Äôt painted anything(#8)Yeah, ditto everyone else. VOC's and dust are triggers of mine too, and I made sure to have other places to be while my room was done up recently. Stay over with family for a while, at least a few days after the painters deem it dry. To be extra, warm up the room with space heaters, air it out for a day or two, then cool it back to normal room temp. That'll help the paint cure fully and get the bulk of the VOC's out.(#9)[these DIY box air filters should help with filtering out the chemicals ! much cheaper than the big name air purification systems that work just as well](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1PxEzYtggtE)(#10)Paint and strong fumes do trigger Asthma.(#11)Even after the paint job is done, fumes can linger and trigger asthma attacks. Bring in plants to absorb the chemicals. Porthos and English Ivy and Mother-in-law's-tongue, are good for this. But they need a lot of light to work."
‚ÄúExtra Breath‚Äù Phenomenon,11,0.83,7,"(#1)During an asthma attack, your lungs are inflamed, reducing the ability for air to pass through freely. The way your lungs take in air is not your muscles opening the lungs, more that it's opening your chest and allowing the lungs to draw in air to fill the new space. The lag time between you expanding your chest and the lungs inflating to fill that new space is usually imperceptible. But if your lungs are inflamed and not able to take in air as quickly, there can be a delay. What you're experiencing is basically a slow-motion wheeze, where usually the air punches through the mucus and creates that rattling noise, yours isn't so much. If this is something that you experience regularly, you really should talk to a doctor about it. It's not normal, and a controller medication will likely help you a lot.(#2)I call it ‚Äúsipping air‚Äù. I have to think my way through my breathing patterns to stop it.(#3)Who keeps downvoting everything in this thread(#4)I get this randomly about once every two weeks if I am taking a deep breath. I thought it was just me.(#5)I get this when my asthma is bad. I‚Äôve also tried googling it with no luck. I‚Äôve just put it down to air passing through phlegm or some place really congested. I can hear air entering while I start exhaling. It‚Äôs like my breathing is off beat."
First time diagnosed @ 37 and just home from a 3 day stay in the hospital,7,0.82,18,"(#1)Hello! 

Long time asthma sufferer of 30 years here. Asthma inhalers in my case are used when I‚Äôm short of breathe or wheezing to prevent me from having an attack. Most inhalers say 2 puffs every 4-6 hours but I usually do 3 puffs ( I am not a doctor so don‚Äôt follow my directions lol) you can definitely over do it if you take to much . When I was a kid I got ahold of my inhaler and kept puffing it because it made me feel good not knowing I was getting high off it and my parents had to take me to the emergency room with a super fast heart rate ( I think I did like 15 puffs lol not good). The best thing to do is to see an asthma specialist so you can possibly be put on a preventative medication that you take daily to keep your asthma at bay. If you feel like you can‚Äôt breathe and the inhaler is not working, please do not hesitate to go back to the emergency room or call an ambulance. Asthma is not something to mess around with. Asthma can be controlled and you can still live a normal life .

Make sure you pay attention to the dosage on your inhaler.(#2)I‚Äôve had Asthma for nearly 20yrs. The ‚ÄúRescue‚Äù inhaler is a little blue guy, right? Ventolin I think was the brand name, but the drug label should read ‚ÄúSalbutamol‚Äù.

Anyway, that drug basically opens up your airways in your lungs, to help you breath better. It‚Äôs a rapid-relief drug. If you are short of breath, take one puff of it, wait one minute and take another if you‚Äôre still having issues. 

If you‚Äôre still having issues after this, then you should go to the Hospital. I assume they gave you detailed instructions on how to take drug, it‚Äôs fairly simple, just follow the steps the doctor or pharmacist provided.

As far as why you are short of breath, I‚Äôm not your physician, so I won‚Äôt advise you on this. All I will say is that your Salbutamol was given to you for shortness of breath, and if you feel like this qualifies, then it‚Äôs within your discretion to use it. Just refer to the dosage on the label if you‚Äôre not sure about overdoing it, and again if you do use it and still feel no relief go see a doctor again.(#3)I‚Äôm sorry you had such a bad experience, and I hope you‚Äôll feel better soon!

Regarding the inhalers: the rescue inhaler works fast, with an effect lasting from 4-6 hrs. You can take 1 or 2 puffs at a time, but should not use it more than 4 times in 24 hrs (that‚Äôs my pulmonologists instruction, I‚Äôm not a doctor, just an asthma sufferer). The daily inhaler has a longer effect, try to take it at the same time every day. If you can, I‚Äôd suggest to go to a pulmonologist, they can help you much better than general physicians, and maybe identify your triggers.

Also, don‚Äôt feel guilty if you have to go to the ER again or sth. Sometimes, after a severe attack, it can last longer for the lungs to get better I think.(#4)When I got my first maintenance inhaler, I was changing to a combination steroid (Fostair) from montelucast tablets. The doctor said, that In the first week of using the new inhaler I still need to take the pills as well, because it can take up to two weeks for the steroid to start working fully. So without any old med, you probably have to ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù with the emergency inhaler, until the maintenance starts to fully work. But if you feel that you need to use it way too much, then maybe you should talk to your doctor.(#5)Just curious, did you go to the hospital because of a severe asthma attack, or other symptoms?

I had a similar experience in January.  Hospitalized for 4 days, sent home with steroid inhaler, rescue inhaler and steroids to wean off.  Never had asthma before and Drs disagreed if that was the cause or not.  Also 37yo(#6)Go ahead and use the rescue inhaler when you feel short of breath. You can also use it preventatively before exercise or anything else that tends to trigger you. If you‚Äôre using it more than 4 times a day (2 puffs each time), talk to your doctor again. If you‚Äôre at or under 4 times a day, you should see that usage goes down as you spend more time on the prednisone and daily inhaler."
Nebulizer with saline solution for moderate to severe asthma. Is it worth to invest to treat your asthma and clean mucus of your lung?,13,0.88,15,"(#1)If your asthma is poorly controlled with Symbicort, talk with your doctor about going on a different maintenance medication.(#2)nebulizing saline definitely helps clearing the lungs.(#3)Hey same thing happen to me after getting Covid I have you tried it yet? They put me on Flovent put doesn‚Äôt help that much(#4)Absolutely ! moderate asthma here . anytime during a flare up its worth it and especially good to have on hand incase during emergency(#5)I case you're worried about the costs: I'm not sure about Canada, but in Germany your health insurance pays for a nebulizer if you have asthma(#6)I'd say make sure to try normal steam first. If sitting in a warm, steamy bathroom with the shower going on hot does nothing for you, you'll get very little out of a saline neb.

That said, you can also get Albuterol neb vials prescribed for you. They're much more effective than a normal rescue inhaler. I'd ask your doc about it.(#7)If you get lots of chest infections then it's worth it. Keeping the mucous moving will help prevent infections."

It sounds like they tried to accommodate you by letting you work from home, as well as a few other things, but that this wasn't sufficent for your wellbeing.

At this point, if things are as serious as you are making out, you should probably quit. You mention not being able to find another job due to being so ill. Consider quitting anyway. If your health issues are a result of your workplace, after quitting you should get better fairly quickly and can resume looking for a job. While there are laws designed to protect us and others with disabilities, ultimately, to the extent possible, you need to take as much responsibility for your own health as humanly possible since no one else has the same kind of incentive as you do.(#3)I completely understand OP.
I also have a major allergy to dogs,  and people think I'm just being mean. 
No. I actually need to be able to BREATHE!
It's frustrating because I actually like animals,  and hate turning them away. 
But if I don't,  it won't end well.(#4)I‚Äôm so sorry. I really don‚Äôt have anything constructive to include to the conversation other than I totally understand given my own battles with dogs and asthma/allergies. Thankfully I do work from home with no pressure and our office is technically dog free (I say technically cause the CEO‚Äôs dog comes with him but nobody else can bring theirs ‚Ä¶) but it is fucked that people put their personal feelings about dogs over other people‚Äôs health and think we‚Äôre just being dramatic.

More than anything, I‚Äôm truly shocked this isn‚Äôt a legal issue on your part. Not to be that person but really, you can‚Äôt sue for something like this?? I‚Äôm at a loss.(#5)>I almost died while working at Pinterest because there were dogs everywhere in the office. 

I hate fucking Pintrest now. 

If I was in your shoes I would just find another job. When your values and a company's values don't line up, it really doesn't build for a strong career. 

I would keep track of everything in writing. Have physicians willing to write things related to your medical issues in writing. Print off your medical records and keep a record. Ask for ADA accommodations. That way if they ever retaliate you have recourse. 

But I would look for a different position elsewhere.(#6)>Free food beat out dogs at work, but nearly killing us did not.

That's because the health department can leverage what you had not: Sanctions. Fines. Monetary incentive.

You should have talked with multiple employment lawyers many years ago. The second best time is now.

As far as allergen-free workplaces, look for food service or food service adjacent industries (tech support for register equipment comes to mind). Those will be your best bet to avoid dog dander in the future.(#7)*takes notes on the places where I can work and bring my dog*(#8)I'm okay with cats but dogs ugh I got a mild allergy to them but they're also annoying. Why do people have to bring them everywhere?(#9)I‚Äôd find a job that is in no way in the tech field.  I‚Äôve never seen an internet/tech/it related company that didn‚Äôt allow pets to one extent or another.  At my husbands last job the CEO brought any animal in need of bottle feeding from his hobby farm to work with him, cause, obviously, the animal would die otherwise.  

The ADA is in a tough spot on this.  It‚Äôs illegal to ask someone why they have a service dog.  There is no requirement to register service dogs.  More than just seeing eye dogs are life saving.   Seizure dogs, blood sugar sensing dogs, autism dogs that keep non verbal kids from fleeing, etc.   So the ada has to choose between disabilities, not a thing anyone wants to do.  So they settle on reasonable accommodations‚Ä¶a dog free floor probably counts as that.  

Then you add the multitude of assholes who claim their pet is a service dog and we have ended up in a place where there are so many ‚Äúservice‚Äù dogs in any given spacethat there is absolutely no point in excluding pets.  The Ada needs to crack down on what is and isn‚Äôt a service dog and requiring licensing of said dogs as a first step to fixing the problem‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm pretty certain that would require changing the Ada in general, cause asking you to prove you‚Äôre disabled enough to need a service animal is definitely against the Ada currently."
How Quickly Can Asthma Symptoms Appear?,7,1.0,6,"(#1)I got diagnosed really quickly too, basically went from (what I thought was) zero symptoms to asthma over a summer, in my mid-20s, and was diagnosed based on my descriptions by my GP (no symptoms when I was in the office, though a couple years later it was confirmed by a pulmonologist). But after the diagnosis as I started to both learn more about asthma in general, and my own personal symptoms, I have come to realize that I‚Äôve had it my whole life, and just never got diagnosed until then. I still generally have no symptoms in the office, now in my mid-40s. Turns out that even when I‚Äôm in an asthma exacerbation, the extent of my asthma is mild, but I notice it really soon, so even when I‚Äôm having issues, it‚Äôs not always severe enough for doctors to hear with a stethoscope.(#2)Mine came on suddenly around mid twenties.  Apparently it‚Äôs very common for people to develop asthma in their twenties without having it before.(#3)Can be overnight. I had my first asthma attack at 28, had no idea what it was and it took a year to diagnose. Not fun.(#4)[deleted](#5)Mine came on suddenly one summer (right before I turned 21 and right before my senior year of college). From talking to my mom about some issues when I was a kid, I realized I likely had it my whole life and it was just never serious enough or taken seriously when I complained about symptoms (PE teachers calling me ‚Äúout of shape‚Äù as a stick thin kid instead of calling home is the one that sticks out in my mind). 

I think it could be worth a second opinion, I got one when I was first diagnosed (at 20/21, got the second opinion because the pulmonologist who diagnosed me only did so after trying to insist I had sleep apnea, he even over reported my weight by 30+lbs in my chart and misrepresented what I told him my symptoms were to make it fit, then refused to put me on an HFA inhaler when the Breo he started me on didn‚Äôt work for me and my asthma was only getting worse every day)

New pulmonologist thought it was hilarious the first insisted on sleep apnea and switched my meds ASAP, I improved a lot in a couple of weeks (have since switched from that one). Even now I have a phenomenal allergist who is treating me for allergies and asthma, when the asthma gets worse he switches things up to get it controlled, but when I mentioned it to my general practitioner before I started seeing the allergist the GP dismissed it completely and prescribed me a dry powder inhaler (like the Breo) when I asked for an HFA one with a spacer. I had to do all the research and tell her what to give me, while my allergist educates me and comes up with new solutions when I need them. 

Having a doctor you trust and that shows they know what they‚Äôre talking about, explains things to you and gives you reasoning behind their treatment plans is really important. I left my GP‚Äôs office entirely after the experience I had with them about my asthma and a couple of other issues that lead me to not trust them, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever leave my allergist because I trust him 100% with my care.(#6)Thanks for the feedback all!

Seems like it is in fact something that can just appear one day out of nowhere with no previous symptoms.

Will try an get a referral to a respiratory specialist/pulmonologist to confirm the diagnosis. Would make me feel more confident in the diagnosis if they actually did some tests as described in the comments here. And hopefully can try some different inhalers that work better than what i've got now.

Cheers!"
Can you suddenly get asthma?,8,1.0,20,"(#1)GERD causes adult onset asthma...(#2)There is usually more than just shortness of breath. Wheezing, sometimes mucus, and you will absolutely hear it on a stethoscope if you're having asthma symptoms.

Have you tried quitting vaping? I imagine if you're in the early stages of popcorn lung (common with vaping) it may not appear right away on an xray.(#3)There is a link between GERD and asthma.  And there are a couple of lung conditions linked to vapping.  Have you seen a pulmonologist?(#4)You can also try the peak flow meter. But Ofcourse best bet is to goto the Doctor and tell them to check for asthma(ie. don‚Äôt try to guess which test to take to get diagnosed for asthma, just tell them to do the tests required to determine if you have asthma)(#5)You definitely can. Could be made worse by GERD.
Mine for sure is, it feels like you're dying when both act up. 

But if you have allergy problems with it, see an asthma allergy immunologist. A pulomogist can also do asthma stuff.(#6)The vaping has probably just caused you irreversible lung damage which is incredibly common because vaping is more toxic than smoking so it is likely to not be asthma but something different you'd need a lung scan"

How much does constant talking impact asthma?,10,0.92,16,"(#1)In my personal experience, a lot. I'm generally a quiet person, so I feel like that amplifies it too, as I'm just not used to talking a lot.(#2)Look into chronic hyperventilation syndrome.  I have this problem as well.(#3)My theory is the more you talk, the more you breathe, leading to more irritants being drawn in and causing inflammation in the airways.

Try getting an air purifier and personal humidifier.(#4)Oh that happens to me as well, i've always been the chatterbox in the family and before i got asthma i was fine talking for hours but now after a few minutds i have to stop due to the lack of air and the throat feeling. If you find out how to fix that tell us please(#5)Are you hydrating? Lots of talking means you need to make sure to drink lots of water to keep everything from drying out.(#6)I sing and talk a lot and haven‚Äôt experienced that before, but of course that‚Äôs only my experience. I wonder if there is something in the office that‚Äôs a trigger, like an allergen or irritant of some kind?(#7)i‚Äôm an introvert but i do have moments that would classify me as an extrovert lol like when i‚Äôm with friends. but yes i do feel like i am running out of breath if i talk too long or too fast, and i have to catch my breath as i‚Äôm talking. it‚Äôs wayyy more noticeable when i‚Äôm sick or had an asthma attack/episode.(#8)I‚Äôm introverted so I‚Äôm usually quiet but I never thought about my asthma affecting my not talking much.ü§î(#9)Asthma and a smoker.  I work at call center job for 13 years.  It can be difficult at times.  Managing your symptoms are priority number one.  Maintenance inhaler is key. I am in the process of quiting smoking it's tough but it'll eventually get better. I can take on average 120 calls a day.(#10)I‚Äôm a teacher. Talking doesn‚Äôt impact me as much as exercise, but definitely more than just sitting around. It‚Äôs worse if I‚Äôm wearing a KN95 equivalent mask because I have to talk louder through it, and it‚Äôs harder to suck in fresh air. KN95 equivalent masks with more space in front of the face (like a duckbill) are better for me than ones that press right against the tip of my nose and lips.(#11)I‚Äôm told I have moderate to severe asthma. My job requires me to talk a lot as well and by the end of the day, I‚Äôm usually exhausted. I often wondered if this is related to my asthma because I do work out like 4 times a week mostly alternating between weights and treadmill for cardio nothing else. And it‚Äôs not that bad. Talking all day makes me more exhausting than working out."
"Im 17,and i think i have asthma?(M)",1,1.0,6,"(#1)Sounds like you should quit smoking if you enjoy breathing.(#2)Asthma is usually a problem with exhaling, not inhaling. I would suggest stop smoking and see a doctor.(#3)How about you stop smoking and see what happens. If you still have problems go to doctor.

We are not experts here. Most of us have diagnosed asthma and come here to talk about different things regarding asthma but it doesn't mean we can give out diagnosis.(#4)Why do people think this is a diagnosis page for asthma. Visit the doctor bruh"
are there any alternatives to inhalers?,29,0.97,53,"(#1)If you are having breathing difficulties, you need to go to urgent care and then follow up with your regular doctor.(#2)so when i was having real bad issues with my asthma and before i realized i nebulizer would have come in handy cause things were worsening , always sit up up , do not lie down this can cause you to cough more and your breathing to worsen . While you are sitting up like on a couch for example it is easier to take deep breaths if needed(#3)caffiene. I find a hot bath or shower helps me. Ultimately, if you are truly struggling, you do need to go to the hospital.(#4)I don‚Äôt know where you live but a pharmacy or A&E department should be able to issue an emergency inhaler. I live in the UK and this has happened to me a few times and I‚Äôve managed to get an inhaler.(#5)I would use your nebulizer since you have it. You can also drink hot water or tea (no milk). Avoid cold beverages. That's what I do if I've used my asthma medicine the max number of allowed times in a day and still have asthma.(#6)I found steam really helped me when I forgot my inhaler once and had a bad asthma attack.(#7)If you are finding it hard to breath you need to go straight to A&E and they will supply you with an inhaler from the hospital pharmacist(#8)Primatine mist (adrenaline inhaler) and bronkaid (ephedrine pills) can be bought at a pharmacy OTC (bronkaid is usually behind the counter). Definitely not a long term solution, but could be helpful just to hold you over til you can refill your actual inhaler. Might want to talk to the pharmacist about them though, because they have their own quirks and issues.(#9)Swimming definitely helps. If you can‚Äôt get to a pool or open water then lay face down over the end of a bed and bend from the waist. I find it helps to relieve asthma symptoms quite a bit. I used these techniques before I was able to finally get my asthma under control.(#10)I find that breathing exercises help a lot when I am having asthma. I do one where I breathe in deeply through my nose, hold my breath for 10 to 30 seconds, then breathe out very slowly through tightly pursed lips. I get a lot of relief after I do that a few times.

I‚Äôve also read somewhere that practicing hold your breath even longer (if you can do it comfortably) can be helpful for asthma in the long term.

Of course, I also take Symbicort daily.(#11)12 hour sudafed helps me need the inhaler less often.(#12)Before an emergency happens i do a few things to help ease/ prevent symptoms as soon as i start noticing difficulty breathing bc the sooner the better. Sit at a 45 degree angle like in a hospital bed. Use pillows to prop yourself up. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Keep your posture good (shoulders back, tall neck) so as to really open up your chest and give yourself as much space as possible to fill your lungs. Take off your bra and other tight clothing, even the waistband of jeans can be irritating. If its an emergency, you really do need medication but if its a bit niggly and could be staved off with some tlc and rest, these do help. 

In other areas, if you‚Äôre worried about this in the future, i have some general advice that you may find helpful or may wish to ignore. Limiting your caffeine and dairy consumption can help with symptoms, along with always wearing a scarf this time of year, or making sure to be extra careful about catching a cold/the flu etc. In the summer be sure to keep up with allergy meds you may need. Keeping your home space free of dust and pet dander/ fur can help, in addition, the air at home may be too dry for you due to AC or central heating and could be unnecessarily irritating your asthma. 


This probably isn‚Äôt the answer you‚Äôre looking for, OP, but i would have liked this advice for my own younger self so hopefully someone finds something helpful here.(#13)I always make a hot drink üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ ( I‚Äôve heard from a friend that sea moss destroys mucus? Gonna Google it now )(#14)Take caffeine. It helps alot.(#15)It‚Äôs definitely not as good as medication but caffeine does help(#16)Walgreens sells the primatine inhaler or tablets that will settle your airways. Use for emergencies only bc when i used it it made my chest hurt for a sec. Reviews said it would. But i kept it for these purposes. You dont need a prescription for it but the tablets you have to ask for at pharmacy counter.(#17)You should also be able to talk to your pharmacist or the tech, there‚Äôs options to get a refill sooner. It‚Äôll be under ‚Äúlife saving medicine‚Äù or ‚Äúemergency medicine‚Äù or something like that. I‚Äôve had issues and they approved the refill sooner by doing that in the computer.(#18)That should be discussed with your doctor.

From my personal experience, there are inhalers, nebulisers and prednisolone tablets.

The inhalers are what I use most because I take them with me everywhere.

If you are caught for what ever reason without your medication and you are in a bad way, try a quick hard breath in, through your nose, then breathe out slowly. Repeat this at least three times. I learnt this from my breathing rehab.

Clearly, it is best to have your medication within reach at all times.

I have a nebuliser, but whilst it is effective, it is also very noisy.

Prednisolone is my last resort, it is only used when all else fails.

Beyond prednisolone ......(#19)Taking a really hot shower helps, the steam always clears up my wheezing a little bit. Then sitting up and drinking something hot, like a cup of tea helps as well. It‚Äôs not a long term solution, but it‚Äôll make the wait for your new inhaler a little easier.(#20)Hot steamy bath or shower. Let the room get really full of steam and that usually helps for me when i have really bad asthma(#21)But do you have meds for your nebulizer like liquid albuterol? Because if so no problem. I have to say it‚Äôs so disturbing how many of these posts in the US are some variant of ‚ÄúI have no meds what else can I do?‚Äù there is really no substitute for your life saving medicine and I am so sorry you are without it.(#22)Nebulizer helps if you need a treatment but in general inhalers are for emergencies(which I try to avoid as much as possible personally). 

When I had neither of these and no medical though‚Ä¶ many a steamed bathroom and lots of mint tea that smelled strongly and meditative exercises to help push through it.(#23)Google resting positions for breathing. I did some exercises in a clinic (I had physical therapy for asthma) and they help tremendously. You can google asthma breathing. I don't know how to explain. There are techniques that help.(#24)There‚Äôs a pill you can get at Walmart, Bronkaid and it helps. It‚Äôs bronchodilator, I think they just started carrying it again. EDIT it will be behind the counter, I‚Äôm sure other places carry it.(#25)Are you able to access something like a Minute Clinic to get another prescription? You really should not be having an uncontrolled asthma attack without your meds.(#26)Use your nebulizer if it helps! If you need it portable, Amazon does sell some portable ones that are battery or just usb operated.(#27)If you would use your rescue inhaler, to ahead an pull out the neb. 

Once the inflammation cascade starts, kill it with meds."
"Wearable Sensors for Asthmatic Children - (Spo2 for 2.5 year old, remotely monitored by parent)",0,0.5,7,"(#1)I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any wearable devices for child at the moment. It might de easier to take readings on a regular schedule with a child sized oxygen saturation monitor. If you really want to use the watch maybe try the ankle. You should have a regular monitor too because watches might not be accurate. Ask the doctor what they recommend.(#2)Generally in asthma a drop in O2 saturations is a later symptoms, as we generally (children included) compensate in other ways to stop that from happening. Is constant O2 monitoring something that has been recommended by their medical professional? If not, I would encourage you to either purchase one that you can use when you believe your child is struggling with their breathing (I imagine it would need to be a young child specific one), or seek advice on how to spot the early warning signs of distressed breathing (you may already know these, so sorry if I‚Äôm presuming) so you can utilise medication etc. 

Additionally, be aware that any constant SpO2 monitor that you can purchase in the form of watch etc, is unlikely to be reliable. The same can be said to a lesser degree with a finger monitor. The only way to truly determine hypoxia is through an arterial blood gas. 

I completely understand that it can be really scary to have a chronically unwell little one, so I hope this reads with the kind tone I intend it to. Are you in the UK?(#3)For a kid? No. But I use my Apple Watch for a lot of what you are asking for. You may consider a smaller watch face? Otherwise youre headed to the pharmacy for the old school pulse ox"
Worries about reliance on Combivent (Ipratropium bromide and Salbutamol). How long till Pulmicort become effective?,0,0.5,2,"(#1)Are you on oral steroids like prednisone? Personally I'm always way more concerned with oral steroid dose than inhaled steroids or nebs.  Recovery can be a week to a couple months, it really just depends on so many different factors like related infections."
Gagging Cough,4,0.84,7,"(#1)A visit to a pulmonologist will be able to answer that question. If there is chronic mucus in his lungs that would certainly exacerbate a typical asthmatic episode. Also, many asthmatics describe an ‚Äúitchy‚Äù feeling in the throat/lung area though it‚Äôs hard to really describe the feeling. In any case if he IS having an asthma exacerbation he needs to be treated for both acute and chronic symptoms to get it under control. A quick acting inhaler (like albuterol), a maintenance inhaler (inhaled steroid like Symbicort), and an action plan so his vital signs can be looked at as indicators of his daily condition (like a peak flow meter and blood 02 monitor). Is he using those? You mentioned he has asthma. Has he been tested for Covid?(#2)Does he have postnasal drip? That makes my throat feel like ""spiders are tickling it"".(#3)I get this exact cough with asthma. The gagging cough is quickly resolved with my rescue inhaler, and then it proceeds to a less annoying productive cough until I get all the phlegm out. It‚Äôs a dry cough, but there is always lots of phlegm down there that I don‚Äôt feel until I use Ventoline.

It could also be post nasal drip, but you could try giving him his rescue meds next time to check?(#4)My son is 2.5 and has severe viral-induced asthma. He‚Äôs on 3 puffs of Flovent a day, plus has his ventalin when he‚Äôs sick.

He‚Äôs had that gagging cough before when he has a lot of mucus. He literally chokes on the mucus. It‚Äôs made him throw up before. It doesn‚Äôt always happen so I think it depends on what kind of virus he‚Äôs battling at the time.(#5)Ouch, hope he feel better. Seasonal swings also cause sinus infection and flu. For itchiness, try some warm water and honey, or if he can take direct than better will be some warm honey (1 tablespoon) with crushed black pepper (powder). This soothes the throat and reduces the itchiness which causes coughs leading to wheezing and asthma. 

Also if you have cold weather, try cold mist humidifier in night. I have one for me (40 with sports induced asthma) and for my kids room. It helps with night coughs. 

Check with a doctor, pray for his speedy recovery(#6)Look up cough variant asthma. Could be, but a doctor will know better than us.(#7)With my asthma I don't wheeze I cough but this sounds to me like an allergic response given the nose and throat sensations too, give him anti histamine and take him to an allergist"
How do I sanitize my inhaler (Flovent) effectively?,1,0.67,2,"(#1)Ask the pharmacist to request an exception from the health insurance to replace lost medication. Most health insurance companies will do this at least once a year.(#2)Take it apart as much as you can. Hot (not boiling) water and dish soap. Soak, rinse, rinse again.  Focus especially on cleaning out the metering valve and spray nozzle.

You will be fine."
Could covid trigger asthma?,2,1.0,11,"(#1)Yeah. I've definitely heard of it triggering asthma. I don't have any sources to back it up, but I've seen it all over Reddit and other online forums.(#2)Yes.  I've been through it twice.  Delta and omicron.  Delta was bad.  Could be anxiety but yes.  Asthma attack or I could have copd.  I just dont know anymore. I try and make everyday a good day. Found out I have sleep apnea.(#3)Hey.  When you were diagnosed what were your test results like? I've had two pulmonary function tests abs passed both but still have asthma symptoms!! I'm 4 months post covid mild pneumonia. For 3 months straight I had breathing through a straw feeling which was my worst symptom.  I have days where I feel so phlegmy but nothing comes up.  I have stabby lung pain in my back.  I have Rib achyness some days.  I have tightness used to be 24 7 now it's a couple times a day.  I hate this virus.  All my tests comes back ok so no one does anything for me I have suffered this whole time.  I did take 3 rounds of prednisone during the first few months but they did nothing for my symptoms also two round of antibiotics. I tried albutrtol and nothing as well."
An air purifier really helped my asthma!,47,0.97,8,"(#1)Yup.  There's a reason kids who grow up in households with gas stoves have a 40% (!!!!!) higher chance of developing asthma (the aerosolized combusted gas from the stove).

Air quality makes a HUGE difference, and not a human alive is capable of manually keeping up with the dust, pollen, pet dander, etc. that's in the air.(#2)Air purifiers and humidifiers helped me out tremendously.(#3)Absolutely agree! I have three air purifiers in my one bedroom place! I love them so much!!!(#4)HEPA filters is a MUST for asthma!(#5)Any device spesific reccomendations? There are lots of parameters and Idk what to look for(#6)I like the Honeywell white round air filters on Walmart. They are a little loud but very powerful and worth the noise."

Is this asthma or something else?",29,0.95,44,"(#1)Asthma can relate to levels of cortisol (stress hormone). Cortisol mediates stress response as well as wakefulness, meaning it‚Äôs highest in the morning (it causes you to wake up!). Asthma may get worse in the evenings when cortisol is lower. I notice this too.(#2)Yes, because at night our parasympathetic nervous system takes over and it promotes bronchus constriction.

So sleep apnea is disruption of breathing. Is that both a) from nose b) from mouth ?? I have been breathing from my mouth for past 30+ yrs and i asked the doctor if that mean i have sleep apnea but he said NO. Although im sleep deprived and its always really hard to fall asleep for me(#7)Some people can have almost non existant asthma in the day and be blue at night. But asthma symptoms can still be provoked during the day such as during exercise or allergies.(#8)Almost certainly mold or some sort of allergen in your bed, pillow, sheets, room etc.   Try sleeping somewhere totally different and see what happens.(#9)I've had episodes of wheezing during the night and it's clears up during the morning the next day..(#10)Everything is wrong with me.  I have this as well.(#11)Shortness of breath while lying down can also be an indicator of heart disease. I am not a doctor, so check it out yourself online.(#12)Maybe you are sensitive to something that‚Äôs in your bedroom?(#13)I have asthma when I run in the day but I have asthma that triggers just because it‚Äôs night time also(#14)Do you change your bed sheets regularly?

Worried about side effects from steroid inhalers,6,0.87,24,"(#1)Steroid inhalers target your lungs, so you really don't get those full body side effects that are common with oral steroids.(#2)I had the same concerns when I was first prescribed steroid inhaler. I voiced them to my Dr. (which I suggest that you do too), and she said that: 

A) my dose was on a low end, and it had very localized effect

B) none of her 40+ patients prescribed steroid inhaler had any side effects, 

C) Steroid inhaler would get me my life back, because I would be able to get my asthma under control and live the life I wanted. The reason she's prescribed it for me was because it is the most effective and least risky medicine. 

D) there are ways to reduce chances of side effects from steroid inhaler, duck as rinsing mouth and gargling after using it.


My Dr. was right about every single point. I'm glad I followed her instructions, and in 12 years of being on steroid inhaler I haven't had any serious side effects. 

If you have concerns about treatments your Dr prescribes, you should ask them about it as well. Find a Dr that listens to you and addresses your concerns.(#3)I've been on them most of my life. They aren't side effect free no medicine is. But the kind of side effects you get from steroid tablets aren't there with inhalers because the effect is very localised and it doesn't go into your bloodstream. The one side effect I have had is damage to my teeth but that's easily avoidable with just making sure you brush your teeth after taking them so no medicine remains in your mouth.(#4)Inhaled steroids are NOT the same as systemic, oral steroids. The inhaled steroids are localized and act in the lungs. They are not associated with negative side effects like weight gain or moon face. They target inflammation directly in your lungs where they are inhaled.  

When people talk about how bad steroids are they are usually talking about anabolic steroids like the kind body builders use or oral steroids like prednisone pills. While oral steroids can be extremely useful for treating bad flares and inflammation, long term use (over a couple weeks) can cause some very nasty side effects.(#5)The nebulizer simply hides the symptoms. It does NOT treat the inflammation.

You're confusing oral steroids like prednisone which used long term can cause moon face. ICS do not cause this. I've been on ICS for over 20 years without side effects.(#6)Moon face is more common with Prednisone.  I'm on wixella 500/50. The only side effect for me is throat irritation if I don't rinse my mouth out very well after taking it.(#7)I have a love hate relationship with steroids.  I don‚Äôt worry very much about the inhaled type though.  Oral is much tougher.

That being said my first line of Eden‚Äôs is a steroid inhaler.  And second line is oral.  I have learned if I wait or don‚Äôt take it when I need it I run into huge problems. 

Years ago I told my pulmonologist how much I didn‚Äôt want to take steroids.  He looked me straight in the eye and told me that if I‚Äôm in the hospital and he‚Äôs trying to save my life he will not stop to ask my permission.  I learned the lesson well.(#8)Nah the type of steroids in inhalers won't do that but the tablets will"
"So just discovered I had asthma, and then this subreddit, could use some positivity",1,0.67,8,"(#1)So I'll tell my story here. I've always just not done things that made my body feel wrong. It seems to be a hypochondria thing, although I'm not sure. Anyways, I always wouldn't run because running made my legs hurt. I'm a high school student now, and in science we learned that your legs hurt when you run from lactic acid fermentation, which is normal. In pe at the start of class we're supposed to do two laps of the 1/4 mile track at the start of class, but previously I've always just walked one. The other day, I was approached by my pe teacher (who is amazing) and he asked me if I did both laps, and I told him I had only done one, and he said that the best grade I could get for a day where I didn't do them was a c- and then on Friday we were also doing prep for pacing for running the mile, and I was like OK! I'm going to do two laps! And I found a pace that I was able to kinda jog the first one, but then I had to slow down to catch my breath, which is normal for me. My teacher speed walked with me and set a goal of which part of the lap I should try to run, and which part I could still walk, and I got to the part where I was gonna run and started to run and the area around my trachea started to hurt, which happens sometimes when I run and I decided no I am not running until I feel like I have my breath back so I only ended up doing a tiny bit more running but I walked the rest of my second lap and I was really short of breath and a friend came up to me and talked me through some slow breathing she said helped her with anxiety and asthma and I ended up sitting out of class for like half an hour trying to catch my breath and then returned and finished class just doing what I felt like I could do but the brain gears were turning so after class I looked up if it was normal for breathing to hurt when you exercise hard and uh as it turns out, nope. And then I looked at some things about like should you get tested for asthma and was like oooooooohh this explains so much, among other things I have a cousin and an aunt with asthma, so yep I could definitely have asthma so I texted my mom and we decided to talk to my doctor after school so we sent a message and called the nurse and talked about stuff and the nurse was like yeah sounds like you probably have mild asthma I'll talk to your doctor about next steps when she gets back on Monday and today I've just been chilling just a little out of breath all day and realizing things that have happened to me that were probably asthma things like the few times I was having trouble breathing and my parents assumed it was a panic attack because they're more familiar with that and I definitely did start panicking when I was having trouble breathing but they were like ahh you get panic attacks congrats, but, y'know, I don't think I do. I get some other similar things, but the not breathing tends to come before the panicking and like I used to go on hikes when I was like three I could run up hill for short bursts but it was only short bursts because then I had to catch my breath uh often after I exercise I have trouble drinking water because I need to get air I do bike to school and I am decently fit before I've been frustrated that I keep hearing that exercising often will make you more fit but I never find that running gets easier and that was always really breathing while running(#2)Hi! Asthma might sound scary, but it doesn't have to be at all. If your doctor suspects mild asthma, it's probably very treatable. They'll refer you to a pulmonologist, who will do some tests to confirm it is actually asthma. If it is, you might get started on some meds to control it better. You'll feel better in no time :)(#3)I've had it for over 20 years and it's not scary at all. It's just part of life. I take my meds and I go about my life.(#4)Follow up question - how much can I expect meds to help with my excersizeing? I currently stand at a best mile time of fourteen and a half minutes, after which I was enough short of breath that it took five to ten seconds before I could talk, and I find my limit to almost always be breathing, even though I also have dyspraxia and struggle with coordination. I bike 2.5 miles to and from school every day, so I'm very much not out of shape, and I like the outdoors, especially nature and hikes, but I just kinda can't breathe well enough to sustain the pace I want.(#5)I had my first attack in 1974.  Scared the bejeesus out of me.  I got over the fear.  Sometimes in the middle of the night hopped up on steroids and albuterol I have my moments of despair, that normal. 

Most of us get to know our diseases pretty well.  The trick is to get connected with a pulmonologist you trust, education about the disease, and establishing a treatment protocol .  Learn your triggers and try to adapt your environment as best you can.  Be proactive in flare ups rather than reactive.  I used to try to talk myself out of an attack, now I grab the inhaler.(#6)I‚Äôve had asthma my whole life. If you carry your rescue inhaler on you and talk to your doctor you‚Äôll be fine. Also remember to take your preventative medicine in the morning and at night it helps a lot."
Asthma from COVID?,9,0.91,25,"(#1)One of the things few people seem to understand about asthma is that it's an autoimmune condition. The effect on your breathing is because of an inappropriate immune response. One of the effects of ""long COVID"" or post viral illness is that it triggers your immune system to be on permanent alert. And part of that is triggering new allergies and making existing ones worse. Sadly people are still completely ignorant about this because, although it's been known about for a long time, post viral illness has routinely been under funded and ignored.(#2)To be fair, many governments have been trying to warn people of potential long term affects. It literally is like the plague.

With that said, many asthma meds are used for general lung issues. Were you formally diagnosed with asthma? The beauty of not nowing about long term effects meana if you have a new issue due to covid that isn't asthma, maybe it will go away eventually.(#3)I am sorry for your problems, but on the other hand. This is exactly what people who say ""I'll just get infected and move on with my life"" need to hear. We still don't know what Covid can do to our bodies in long run and it's devastating that people have to suffer long term conditions.

I had my regular pulmonologist control this week and I was surprised I got appointment in completely different location and hospital. As it turned out, she works once a week in a post covid department. So many people there. They were confused why I had appointment and was taken in before them (even though I came after them). Because I am her patient I got first available appointment and she took me right in.

The worst thing is that they don't even know what is wrong with these people because they have a lot of different symptoms.(#4)Yes, I had Covid in May 2020 and was diagnosed with asthma a couple of months after. I‚Äôve also developed a dairy intolerance too. Never had ANY health issues or allergies before Covid; never got sick. I was a perfectly healthy 29 year old. There is still so much we don‚Äôt fully know about the long-term after affects of Covid. 

In my area, the local Long Covid Clinic basically tells you to take it easy and try to exercise üòí. That‚Äôs not massively helpful when your hair is falling out and you feel like your body is on fire all the time.(#5)I got the flu and my asthma was so bad for a while. Maybe a year after that I was really struggling. I bought a few air purifiers, 4 years has gone by, and it has since calmed down dramatically. It's been over a year since I needed an inhaler. Hopefully with a few years and air purifiers the same will happen to you.(#6)I developed severe asthma after having another virus 3 years and a half years ago. I never had respiratory problems before then. I take symbicort with one puff in the morning and one in the evening. It took me three years to get down from 2puffs in the morning and 2 puffs in the evening. I also have sinus problems from that virus and had to have surgery and I do sinus rinses 2x a day. It‚Äôs pretty crazy what a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù virus can do to you!(#7)Other respiratory infections can also ‚Äúcause‚Äù asthma, I know someone who got asthma soon after an RSV infection. But I think you probably need a genetic predisposition as well(#8)I have a relativaly mild asthma, but after i had Covid (I had it twice), my Asthma got worse. It reverted itself to the ""normal"" Asthma after a few weeks. The second time, I was vaccinated and it was less bad.(#9)Yes. I had covid one year ago and since then I have an unresolved lung issue. I did have breathing issues related to seasonal allergies before, but it was mostly localized to the nasal region (and lungs if exposed to cat dander and black mold). I never needed medicine, but I‚Äôve since seen a pulmonologist who prescribed breo and albuterol. I haven‚Äôt taken either yet due to fear of them worsening symptoms.(#10)Yes! Happened to me. The asthma specialist though thinks I had mild asthma before and it just made it worse.(#11)Wouldn't be surprised since covid damages the lungs and it made my mild asthma worse long term now(#12)I'm still trying to figure this out.  I passed two pulmonary lung function tests and they won't give me any medication.  I feel like I have asthma it sucks.  Chest tightness,  back lung pain,  Feeling like I was screaming all day feeling in my throat, extra phlegm after eating sometimes,  air feels thick. I'm not sir what to do anymore.(#13)I'm dealing with the same thing. In hindsight I think I had very mild asthmatic symptoms before. I was fine when I had COVID but now even 3 months later I am dealing with attacks regularly. It's frustrating. I'm young, healthy, vaccinated, and all the messaging is that it's not a big deal (which is ableist) but here we are."
What to do when your parents is suffocating due to asthma?,13,0.93,23,"(#1)Also note that there are two good diagnostic tools that every wheezy household should have.

1- a pulse Oxygen device (clips on the finger and shines light through the CLEAR nail and senses oxygen level in the bloodstream)

2- a peak flow meter. Measures how much the patient can exhale in one big rush.

Buy them. Use them when she‚Äôs feeling good. Keep track of her ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

While an asthma attack is frightening for everyone, most of them can be resolved with a rescue inhaler. DON‚ÄôT PANIC !

And if you don‚Äôt have either of these‚Ä¶ quick oxygen level tests involve checking for lips turning blue ( super bad !) and the ‚Äúrebound‚Äù test by pressing on the fingernail with an edge and watching how fast the tissue under it pinks back up. 

Did I mention some of these tests don‚Äôt work with fancy nails and polish ? Well‚Ä¶ toenails work just as well‚Ä¶(#2)I'm not a medical professional; this is my advice. Follow your doctors' and pharmacists' advice.

Measure the severity with your peak flow meter if you have one.

Pursed lip breathing can buy time until you get rescue meds/emergency services.

Make sure you're taking your controller medication(s) as directed (Dulera, Advair, Breo, Singulair, Etc.)

Rescue medication as directed (albuterol).

Emergency services for emergencies.

To help, you can help your loved one set up their nebulizer breathing treatment by bringing them the machine, tubing, mouthpiece/mask, and albuterol/medication box and plugging in the device for them.

If you do not have a nebulizer, bring them their inhaler.

Ensure they are following their doctor's asthma plan, taking meds, etc.

If the rescue medication does not help, they need to rest and calm until emergency services arrive. Have them focus on pursed-lip breathing.(#3)Why are you, the kid, need to take care of and treat mom when dad is right there? I can understand if no one else is around, but if there is another adult present then they need to step up.(#4)If she has a nebulizer, help her set that up and use it. If she has an emergency inhaler, get that for her to use. If she has nothing for her asthma, she needs to see a doctor and get that sorted. 

But in the meantime if she has none of those, her asthma can be ""treated"" with hot liquids as long as the asthma attack is fairly mild. Give her something like hot water or hot tea (no milk, minimal sugar) to sip on. That likely won't get rid of the asthma attack, but that can often help prevent it from getting worse. She should avoid cold liquids because that irritates the lungs and can worsen an asthma attack.

If her asthma attack is severe, and she has no emergency inhaler or nebulizer nearby, then you should consider calling 911. If she's having so much trouble breathing that when she tries to speak or yell it only comes out as a whisper then that's definitely a sign to call for an ambulance. Monitoring the severity of an asthma attack can be tricky because as it gets worse a person starts wheezing. But then as it continues to get worse the wheezing actually starts to go away because there's so little airflow at that point that there isn't enough airflow to even make a wheezing sound. So just be aware that someone isn't necessarily safe if they stop wheezing during a severe asthma attack. Sometimes that can mean they're actually getting worse.

Like the other commenter said, it's generally a good idea to monitor how severe her asthma is with a peak flow meter. They're usually pretty cheap to buy. For it to be most useful to you, you need to have her use it on a day when she's asthma free so you can get a baseline. Then you can actually track how poor her breathing is compared to her normal. It's going to be tricky to use this during an asthma attack and be able to interpret it meaningfully. But if she uses it once or twice a day she'll actually be able to see her lung capacity going down in the days leading up to an asthma flareup. That's a sign that she should start preventively nebulizing and avoid going outside or exposing herself to her asthma triggers.

Allergies tend to worsen asthma and trigger many allergy attacks, so a long term treatment approach should focus on minimizing allergens and allergies. Make sure the house is clean and dust free. Make sure dogs are bathed regularly. Make sure the pillows are sterilized regularly by throwing them in a dryer. And for any remaining allergies she should strongly consider taking allergy medicine. I've found Zyrtec to be most effect. I often also add Sudafed for sinus congestion and use a nasal spray too.

Edit: Most importantly, just communicate with her. She's an adult. If she insists that she's doing fine then you probably shouldn't call an ambulance for her. It's nice that you want to help, but her asthma is honestly her responsibility. She needs to see a doctor (potentially even an asthma specialist), have prescriptions, and monitor her asthma. And she needs to start giving directions to people for how to help her. Like ""go get my emergency inhaler"" or ""go get my nebulizer and set it up for me"" or ""go get me a cup of hot water"". Allowing her asthma to go untreated and not giving the people around her any way to help is incredibly irresponsible.(#5)Call 911(#6)Does she have an inhaler?(#7)You're a kid. It's your dad's responsibility to take care of your mom. Your mom should also know how to treat her asthma. Did she use her medications at all?(#8)I have an asthma action plan for my son with details on ‚Äúred‚Äù ‚Äúamber‚Äù ‚Äúgreen‚Äù status and notes on what that looks like and what to do. basically green is no issues, amber involves using medication you have at home and monitoring situation, maybe seeing regular doc or urgent care, red is call an ambulance/get to hospital for oxygen.(#9)She needs to get an inhaler and have a dr work with her to get it under control.

In the meantime, since you‚Äôre in a pinch, you may be able to use pseudoephedrine or ephedrine as long as its short-term and you keep the dosage fairly low.

Pseudoephedrine can usually be bought behind the counter at a pharmacy, ephedrine is sometimes sold at nutritional supply stores but that might be a thing of the past.

Its not an ideal treatment but it might tide you over until you get her in to be seen.(#10)Children want to know how to react too. It stops you feeling helpless if you know all the stuff incase am adult panics etc. Just saying. There's great advice here, and now they know.(#11)Going outside at night (preferably barefoot) in the cooler temperatures should help calm you down and reduce panic if you don't have any meds or they just aren't working."
Just recently got asthma as an adult and I'm trying to figure out the easiest way to consistently get inhalers. I imagine something like Capsule? I'm in NYC if that helps. Does anybody use a delivery service like this?,2,0.75,6,"(#1)You have a doctor and insurance? Mail order pharmacy through your insurance will be convenient. Many pharmacies also have delivery. I use cvs because my insurance copay is the same there as mail order and it‚Äôs convenient to use home delivery or just go pick up if I‚Äôm in the area.(#2)Use the mail order pharmacy from your insurance or Amazon Pharmacy if you have Prime.(#3)I use capsule and it‚Äôs good(#4)Here in the uk , we just click a button on our nhs apps and request a repeat prescription and it gets sent straight to your pharmacy and you pick it up in 24 hours(#5)I get my inhalers from Costco - they have auto refill and I always refill as soon as I can.  I get a text when it‚Äôs time.  Most pharmacies have auto refill options.  Many have home delivery too.  That way I don‚Äôt run the risk of running out.  

Many insurance companies allow to more than one inhaler to be dispensed at a time.  Mine, Aetna, allows me to get 3 at a time.  They understand that we need an inhaler at our beside, in our car/purse, downstairs etc.  Call your insurance carrier and ask, then have your doctor write dispense 3.(#6)CVS can deliver."
First day without Albuterol üëéüèª,5,0.86,3,"(#1)ICS can take some time to work. There's also two (maybe three?) dose levels of Symbicort. So maybe you need the higher one. 

And if Symbicort doesn't work, Breztri or something similar might. 

And you could try budesonide nebs or Prednisone. 

If all that fails, there's biologic like Dupixent, Xolair and the new Tezspire.(#2)Everyone reacts differently to medications.  I can‚Äôt use most of the maintenance inhalers that were developed for COPD, most of them seemed to make things worse.  It took trial and error to find the right meds for me.  It took time and patience.  And even with the right mix there are times when I still need the nebulizer.  There are just too many outside factors, like cold west, forest fires and I excepted face full  of dust.(#3)The nebulizer is addictive. Your body is used to that adrenaline boost and craves it. The same is true with the albuterol. You're going to need to wean yourself off them.

Overuse of albuterol and nebulizers will make the meds less effective when the time comes that you actually desperately need them."
Wim Hof Method for asthma treatment?,0,0.5,17,"(#1)Yes. It didn't work. Then I got on good meds. That worked perfectly.

Is taking Sudafed with asthma safe?,1,0.6,8,"(#1)I‚Äôve taken it without any problems I normally talk to the pharmacist when I buy new meds and tell them everything I‚Äôm already on. I rarely talk to the doctor about over the counter meds because it‚Äôs easy to talk to the pharmacist and they are very knowledgeable, often more so than the doctor as that is their specialty. It‚Äôs also easy and you don‚Äôt need an appointment(#2)It‚Äôs my go to. But everyone is different. Be careful and get medical advice from professionals. I am not a doctor nor do I pretend to be one on Instagram.(#3)Call your doctor , not Reddit(#4)Like others have said, ask your doctor to be sure. But, I‚Äôve taken plenty of Sudafed while taking my asthma meds and been fine. My doctor okayed it, I self monitored for potential side effects, but ultimately it‚Äôs been safe for me.(#5)On the Patient Information Leaflet for the Decongestant (Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride) tablets it states:

""Do not use this medicine‚Ä¶
‚ñ† If you are taking stimulants or appetite

Albuterol allergic reaction,1,1.0,2,"(#1)Maybe vocal cord dysfunction. Sounds like me and nothing helps. Its due to my horrible acid reflux. I have the wheezing sound, but it comes from my upper throat due to the vocal cords being messed up. Only happens when i breathe in"
Looking for some advice,9,0.92,10,"(#1)Kind of amazed you were put on Prednisone without any consideration of long term preventive care and a rescue inhaler. Prednisone is for bad attacks over a long period of time.

You need to have a longer conversation with your doctor and have them explain what‚Äôs going on, and what your long term care should look like.

It is possible to ‚Äústart back up‚Äù after ‚Äúgrowing out of it‚Äù‚Ä¶ which, IMHO, is usually an allergic trigger.(#2)One note: the flovent shouldn't be ""instead of"", it should be ""in addition to""; you take the flovent daily as prescribed for prevention, and keep the albuterol with you as a rescue medication if you have an attack anyway. 

I too had thought I'd outgrown my asthma, turns out I was just really used to managing it, lol. One hard sprint in freezing temps knocked the wind straight out of me, and made me realize I'd just been doing really well to avoid my triggers (mold/mildew, intense cardio, extreme temperature change, smoke/thick dust). I've been on controllers off and on ever since, with my latest one (Wixela) working well for me.

Has anything about your environment changed recently? A lot of asthma management is looking for environmental factors and trying to reduce those triggers where possible.

If you're in an area with a lot of pollen or frequent fires, wearing an n95 mask while outside could be helpful. Take a look around your house, especially in bathrooms, and make sure there isn't a leak with some mildew hiding from you. Change your bedding and try a hypoallergenic mattress cover; it's possible you have bed mites, which are generally harmless but most people have at least a mild allergy to their debris. Even some foods can be a trigger, as much as it sucks to say it.

I do want to double check: They did a chest x-ray, right? Walking pneumonia is easy to mistake for other shortness of breath diseases, but won't go away until the source of the pneumonia is treated (viral, bacterial, fungal).(#3)Im 40 and i never out grew from my asthma, but now it‚Äôs reduced to sports induced asthma. Any physical exercise triggers my shortness of breath. I do get seasonal asthma attacks but luckily i dont need to get the prednisone (steroids) course in recent yrs. Although this time hot and cold weather swings make gives me wheezing in nights. The work around for me is the cold mist humidifier. And i also cover my chest with extra quilt during cold nights to keep it warm. 

Hopefully this is helpful and i pray for your speedy recovery(#4)You should probably be on a daily maintenance steroid inhaler (that would be the Flovent) and maybe montelukast like many of us are.(#5)I had some trouble when I was initially diagnosed with asthma (as an adult - I was in my last year at college when diagnosed), then also later on. 

I was originally put on Breo Ellipta, struggled to breathe in enough to really make it effective. I had to switch pulmonologists because the first one I saw who put me on the Breo refused to switch me (they also tried to insist I had sleep apnea, I had no defining symptoms of sleep apnea, they over reported my weight in my chart by 30+ pounds to get my BMI to ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù to justify their claim). My second pulmonologist laughed his ass off at the sleep apnea suggestion and put me on Symbicort. 

Symbicort was great for several years, then I had reoccurring thrush and no dedicated asthma doctor to help me. My primary care doctor and an urgent care doctor were both convinced it was strep (multiple tests were negative, it was obviously NOT strep). I did the stupid thing and just stopped taking the Symbicort without a reliable replacement, asthma was great until it wasn‚Äôt, so I got a new doctor and tried Advair Diskus (didn‚Äôt work for me for the same reason as Breo), started Advair HFA with a spacer and finally feel mostly normal again!

Due to worsening allergies and some other factors I did go up in dosage on the Advair HFA and added some other meds for the allergies, but it still works really well for me. I very much notice the decline if I accidentally miss a dose of it. Sometimes it‚Äôs trial and error, but having a doctor that is on top of it and that you feel is on your side is so helpful!(#6)I went through the exact situation since last year. My doctor prescribed Trelegy for maintenance along with Albuterol for rescue. I‚Äôve been doing much better.(#7)that's what they gave me.......cost an arm and a leg but since I've been on flovent  I have not needed to use my albuterol inhaler at all in the last year(#8)Asthma can go into remission.  No symptoms since age 23. I'm 38yr smoker. I'm in the process if quitting.  It's tough.  But my asthma has been hell on me.  I used my inhaler 2 to 4 times a week.  You need to speak with your doctor about preventative.  I got mine helped allot.  Dealing with general anxiety disorder quitting smoking is really hard.  Mine is allergic asthma.  Shortnes of breath is confusing but it'll only payoff in the end."
Hi,10,0.86,21,"(#1)Wheezing does not necessarily mean it's asthma. You can wheeze and not have asthma and you can have asthma and not always wheeze.(#2)Not sure exactly what you‚Äôre wanting to get out of this question, but no, wheezing or not wheezing is not a sign of your asthma‚Äôs severity. Not all asthma has the same symptoms, some people cough instead of wheeze during attacks. 

If you‚Äôre consistently having asthma symptoms & attacks, your asthma might not be well controlled and you might need to consider adding or switching inhalers to help you with that. A doctor who specializes in asthma (pulmonologist or allergist in the USA) would be the only one qualified to diagnose you & determine the severity of your asthma after running tests, discussing symptoms with you & evaluating you in person.(#3)No. It might be allergy induced or ""sports"" asthma. But if you were diagnosed by pulmonologist surely they told you everything you need to know.(#4)My asthma/trouble breathing does not always have loud wheezing sound either, I am starting to worry if it is a heart problem."
i'm new to asthma so idk if this is a symptom . can it make u feel like u can't breathe thru your nose?,6,0.87,6,"(#1)Sudden change in temperature and humidity can set your asthma off. Are you able to breathe normally with your mouth? I usually get an itchy feeling in my throat combined with coughing. Each persons symptoms can be different.(#2)This is not asthma. This happens when your nasal passages dry out due to cold, dry air.(#3)Try intentionally yawning for widening your throat again, and breathe through your open mouth for a while. See if that helps.

I deal with this quite often as I have too narrow nostrils, chronic allergic rhinitis, as well as chronically tense muscles (especially upper back/neck/shoulders/throat/jaws).

Basically your nose being blocked has nothing to do with asthma (as far as I know) and simply switching to mouth breathing helps (just like when you have a bad cold and your nose is stuffed). The tightening in your throat could be asthma, could be tense muscles, and the intentional yawning should help if it's due to muscle tenseness and not asthma.(#4)I find that a hot shower helps in those situations!(#5)See an ENT.  I had two surgeries and it changed my life."
Do these things cause asthma attacks,3,1.0,7,"(#1)Asthma triggers vary widely between asthmatics. The only thing that can definitely tell you whether what you're experiencing is asthma or not is proper testing for asthma (may be as simple as a lung function test, may require additional trigger testing--normal lung function test can come back perfectly fine for asthmatics). Sometimes, I think doctors prescribe an inhaler for your symptoms and have you try out whether it helps (if a rescue inhaler like albuterol helps, it's a strong indicator it may be asthma; if it doesn't help, it's a strong indicator it's not asthma) instead of/on top of doing lung function and/or trigger tests.

I was actually diagnosed twice, by different pulmologists (second time around because new pulmo didn't believe me when I said I have been diagnosed with asthma, just because my lungs sounded fine). My normal lung function test has always come back perfectly fine so far (going on 20+ years with diagnosed asthma), and I also have like 140% lung volume compared to the ""norm"" for my height and weight, which makes a simple lung function test without any context literally hilariously inaccurate (100% ""norm"" would only be like 72% of my personal best but would still look perfect to someone unfamiliar with me). I also hardly ever wheeze so my lungs typically sound fine too. 

So in order to diagnose me, my pulmos had to trigger my asthma before repeating the lung function test. The first time around, my pulmo had me run around the block until I was experiencing my typical symptoms (suspicion was exercise-induced asthma--which yes, I do have, plus a ton of other triggers) and then did a lung function test; the second time around, they did a metacholin trigger test (where you inhale an irritant before each lung function test to see whether your bronchae react in the asthma-typical way, followed by the reversal-test with albuterol). Both times, the trigger tests got me diagnosed without a doubt.

If I were you, I'd start taking notes about situations and symptoms (like when did you experience symptoms, what kind of symptoms did you experience) and then go to your GP to talk about this and ask for asthma testing (especially since it runs in your family). If asthma is indeed confirmed, your notes provide important info on possible triggers for you; if it's not asthma, your notes can give important hints to other possible causes of your symptoms.

Good luck!(#2)Yes to all of these. I've had asthma since childhood and all of these are triggers or stress on your lungs when you have asthma. A rescue inhaler would probably help you quite a bit. The running may help you effectively exchange air without depleting the O2 to your muscles. Being thirsty is something I also have with no other medical reasons for it. I don't know why my body craves water so much but I listen to it and I do feel better when doing so. Hot showers or steam can really adversely affect my breathing even though it is a treatment for asthma, same goes for cold air. Cold air burns my lungs horribly (I can't win). After taking a shower you can try to rub Vicks (eucalyptus oil) on your chest. I would not try this first as a steam treatment and I would do the rub on your chest instead. The steam and the oil could make you worse. But I understand where you are coming from because I am so short of breath after taking a shower and I need to rest afterwards.

If you are able to I would see your physician and get a rescue inhaler. I would not recommend an over the counter inhaler as they tend to burn your lungs and seem like an irritant.(#3)For some people, yes and for other people no.

> Walking outside when it‚Äôs really hot/cold

Nonasthmatic reason - airways dry out in the cold. In the heat, the body has to work harder to cool off which makes walking harder.

> Lifting heavy things like a box or even my backpack

This can be caused by GERD/silent reflux from bending over.

> Taking a hot shower, except after I shower I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe for like 30 minutes

See response to #1

> Being thirsty???

This is called dehydration and has nothing to do with asthma. It can also contribute to SOB in heat and bending over.

> Running doesn‚Äôt (usually) cause shortness of breath for me but for some reason, walking uphill does

Going uphill requires more effort than running on a treadmill for example.(#4)It is very individual. You need to see specialist so they can be sure it's not heart or something else. Some conditions have overlapping symptoms so you need to do all tests.

When I was first diagnosed I had a lot of different diagnostics, xrays, ultrasound, blood work, allergies test, Spyrometry (idk if that's how it's spelled in English) etc. And only after all that did specialist diagnose me.

Triggers can be different. For me emotional stress is big one, way to humid and warm air is another one. Very cold and dry air is also my trigger. But they can be totally different for other people.(#5)Walking in hot weather Yes !"
I take metoprolol for heart rate control but it helps my anxiety I noticed since you are so Knowledgeable do you think I can still take it and use inhaler more often when asthma acts up or is beta blocker contraindicated in asthma,3,1.0,5,"(#1)This is something you need to discuss with your doctor(s): The one prescribing the metoprolol, and (if a different one) the one treating your asthma.(#2)Talk to your doctor but as someone who also takes it for heart rate control, which coincidentally helps with anxiety as well I haven't had any apparent issues from using my albuterol or symbicort. But just because my doctor didn't see any issues doesn't mean it might be different for you.(#3)Beta blockers are generally contradindicated with asthma, but I think the general consensus these days is that is a balancing of risk - you shouldn't absolutely avoid beta blockers if it leaves other serious conditions untreated (they may be a bigger risk than the risk of exacerbated asthma).

I wouldn't/haven't been able to take beta blockers for my migraine prevention because I've got asthma (it's a common 1st line preventative) -the risk isn't worth the potential benefit - but it would be an entirely different decision if it was to treat a heart condition or seriously high blood pressure.

It's really something you need to discuss with your doctor."

I spent many days on the phone with Dupixent and our specialty pharmacy. My daughter ended up in the ICU with an asthma flare the week before the first delivery. So far, it is showing great results mostly for the eczema. Asthma is improving slowly."

Albuterol before Symbicort?,8,1.0,15,"(#1)Symbicort is a controller inhaler. Albuterol is a rescue inhaler. 

I take symbicort twice everyday with no albuterol. So yes it can absolutely be taken on it‚Äôs own. 

I am not a doctor, so please continue with what your doctor told you to use. But in all of my experiences with the inhalers, I‚Äôve never heard of albuterol being taken before symbicort regularly.

Hope this helps. Again, continue w/ what your doctor prescribed you to use.(#2)I was recently diagnosed and I don't have an Albuterol inhaler or anything at all that is meant for attacks. I only take budesonide (which is the ingredient in symbicort, along with  formoterol) Seeing as she only prescribed me that, and that doesn't even have formoterol in it I don't see why not? but then again doctors here can be dumdums, speak to your own about it in any case(#3)(not a doctor. do ur own research. Ask ur care provider for clarity) 




albuterol is prescribed 1st for emergency use OR for use during uncontrolled periods of time (like if you have a respiratory infection). Some people use the albuterol right before the symbicort so the symbicort can get deeper in their lungs.

Symbicort is a control inhaler intended to work over time to reduce your reliance on the rescue inhaler (albuterol). it is to be taken regularly.

Albuterol is intended to give you instant relief; prescribed to be used as needed. Some doctors prescribe it ONLY for emergencies while some doctors prescribe it for pre-emptive approaches (for instance, an athlete with chronic bronchitis might use their albuterol before they have to run) but you must ask your doctor about that. That use is only for some people.

if for some reason your doctor does not prescribe these two at the same time, they should prescribe albuterol first to prevent an emergency. 


If symbicort works for you, you may not need to use the albuterol as often/at all. Thats the goal! BUT remember to keep your albuterol with you at all times.




remember that many control inhalers are corticosteroids. Not everyone should take steroids so it may take longer for your doctor to decide which control treatment is best for you specifically. i personally am very sensitive to them and for me the adverse affects outweighed the benefits (despite my terrible chronic bronchitis) and It took me 10 years to find a control inhaler that suits me. If what you have been given isnt working for you, speak up! 



Hope that makes sense?(#4)If you're not experiencing an attack, there's no reason to take Albuterol.  Symbicort is long-acting and doesn't work immediately.  NAD, just spoke to a lot of them over the years.(#5)Thanks all. I'm new to this and recently had repeated attacks for months. Finally the Symbicort was added and things seem to be stabilizing now. I'd been taking a nebulizer before the Symbicort to ensure the lungs were open and the medicine got to where it needed to be. Thanks to the feedback, this morning I just took the Symbicort. I'll keep my rescue inhaler with me just in case.(#6)I've heard of some peopel using it to open the lungs before Symbicort, so the powder can get deeper in the lungs. You can use Albuterol between Symbicort puffs. Symbicort is very expensive so to use as a rescue even though it says it can. There is a benefit that when you are feeling you need a rescue you probably need more steroids and that is the idea with using Symbicort as a rescue, you are upping your steroids also.

But my doctors told me to use my Ventolin (albuterol) if I need between Symbicort. Some people us Ventolin like a puff before say exercising, no need to up your steroid intake everytime you work out.

Steroids and the LABD combos should be used sparingly and only by people that can't be controlled on the steroid alone. 

I don't discount the Pharma pushing the combos as they are super expensive compared to an ICS alone . LABD are kind of weird to take daily if you think about it, especially for intermitted asthma.

I take a combo myself, and use Ventolin as needed. I also have plubmcort and that is the ICS inside of symbicrot with the LABD, I try to drop down to that as much as possible, and use ventolin as needed.

But ya, especially for the powders or peopel with asthma in their small airways, there seems to be some benefit to taking one puff of Ventolin and waiting 10 minutes so you airways are wide open to be able to breath the Symbicort way deep in. See the LABD in Symbicort goes down at the same time as the steroid so it can't do that obviously, although taking two puffs spaces apart of the symbirort might, I don't know.

Not a doctor here.(#7)My doctor changed my meds this week, I used to use Inhaled corticosteroids (Alvesco) and my rescue was Ventolin. Now I am on Symbicort. I have question.  


She told me not to use Ventolin any more and instead use Symbicort both as my controler inhaler and rescue. Does that mean I shouldn't use Ventolin anymore in any circumstance or I still can? Or should I just stick to what my pulmonologist told me and use only Symbicort?  


I am confused as I see some of you use both. Disclaimer: I always listen my doctor and ask if I have questions, but this one slipped my mind as she did say only to use the new med.(#8)No, you do not. You only use albuterol if you are having an attack."
Should I be worried(steroid inhaler),0,0.5,10,"(#1)Follow up with your doctor or pharmacist :)

Hi,0,0.5,1,(#1)Talk to your prescribing doctor(s) about this!
Inhaler goes in stomach? (DPI),0,0.5,4,"(#1)No, you can‚Äôt use a spacer with DPIs. Think of spacers as holding chambers to help with technique and timing. There is no timing with DPIs, the drug is only moving when YOU move it with your inhalation.

The best technique advice with a DPI is to inhale fast and forcefully, hold your breath for 5-10 seconds and exhale. If you have an ICS make sure to rinse and spit after.

If you are tasting the medication or feel the powder clumping in your mouth or throat after, you are not inhaling hard enough. If you don‚Äôt have the PIF to properly use a DPI (60 L/min) then you should be on an MDI or SMI instead.(#2)It does not go in your stomach. If you're inhaling as you use it, it goes in your lungs."

Pretty sure it's from the caffeine since caffeine is a stimulant and that was literally the only thing I used to drink with caffeine. Since then, I've switched to black tea for a little relief to cut out the sugar. Neither are as good as a rescue inhaler, but they definitely helped when I didn't have one yet.(#6)Any liquid will help. Not just red bull. Dehydration makes Makes asthma worse.

Thought I would draw attention to the link between stomach upset/heartburn/GERD and asthma.,31,0.87,19,"(#1)I personally think it has interfered with my development (asthma and using medication since 18 months old) like endocrine and digestive system. I have no proof but wonder sometimes what my life would have been like if I had never developed asthma from whooping cough(#2)I have asthma...is this why sometimes I can be sick a little bit during the night and it causes me to cough for a long time, it goes into my lungs? I do take lanzoprazole now which has helped. But it's the worst.(#3)You are right that treating GERD can be helpful for reducing asthma symptoms.

That said, it's straight-up untrue of to imply people can avoid ICS usage altogether by addressing their heart burn or reflux. According to the most modern guidelines, all asthmatics need a ICS controller inhaler. The appropriateness of controller inhaler usage doesn't depend on how well GERD is controlled.

Edit: I also want to point out that OP's link regarding vitamins and steroids is from a site that sells supplements for patients taking steroids. It is not a reputable source and is obviously biased.(#4)Dealing with GERD RN(#5)Currently dealing with GERD at the moment . its causing me a lot of mucus, chest pain from asthma isnt bad but when i drink coffee i find it is making me cough more(#6)can you tell me some of the long term effects of a simple ICS like Symbicort ?

They're literally connected. If your esophagus being damaged by stomach acid that can cause an inflammatory reaction. Since it's connected to your throat and lungs, it's in o√±a sense one system.

Inhaler puffs,2,0.75,1,"(#1)If the counter says 192 and you just opened it, you need to take it back to the pharmacy. This is medication that has been tampered with.

The counter does not go down on its' own."
"Silent, non-attack asthma and daily inhaler",8,1.0,10,"(#1)Sounds like my asthma. My ""attacks"" are more of a slow constant build rather than something that happens all at once. From what I understand, the issue is that this means that your lungs are constantly inflamed, meaning you are at risk of a worse asthma attack. Something like budesonide helps decrease that inflammation and ideally reduces the amount you have to use your rescue inhaler.

I am currently on budesonide in the form of Pulmicort because my asthma got significantly worse in pregnancy. I may stay on it long term unless I can get it more under control with exercise (it has helped me in the past). Having constant inflammation is not good for your lungs!(#2)>If I have never had an asthma attack ever, what is the point of preventative inhalers every single day?

To prevent you having an asthma attack ever. The clue's kinda in the name ;) But asthma attacks actually aren't always sudden gasping or wheezing out of the blue; they're more commonly a worsening of your breathing over hours or even days, so you may well have had what can be classified as an asthma attack before. And even if you haven't, that's not to say you won't without adequate treatment for your asthma.

There two mechanisms at play with asthma, 1) inflammation in your airway, and 2) narrowing of your airway (bronchospasm) which occurs during an attack (and which you can treat with a rescue inhaler). Inhaled steroids reduce 1 so that your airways are less reactive making it less likely for 2 to happen. You have to take it every day - it doesn't work otherwise. It may be a rescue inhaler your grandmother is using (usually blue - albuterol?) but if she is using a daily steroid inhaler whenever she thinks she needs it, it won't be doing anything for her. They don't work like that, they have to build up in your system and remain at a consistent level to treat the inflammation.

Leaving the inflammation from asthma untreated can permanently change the shape of the airways. The tissue of the bronchial tubes becomes thickened and scarred - i.e. it causes permanent damage and reduced lung function that can't be reversed.

My asthma sounds like it was very like yours when I got diagnosed, you may feel it's not that bad, but believe me, you'll feel so much better when it's under control and you remember/realise how good it feels to be able to breathe properly! It's probably impacting your quality of life more than you think.(#3)You should use the budenoside as directed which means every day. You don't build up tolerance to bedenoside so you have nothing to worry about there. What it does is keeps the inflammation down in your lungs so you don't have an attack.

Budenoside should not have any effect on your being able to function. Your ADHD meds probably have more of an impact.(#4)I've had an acute asthma attack exactly once in my life, and I've done everything in my power to avoid those ever happening again. But a more ""chronic"" attack, just a slow tightening over days/weeks/months, is something I constantly battle with. I often won't really notice I've gotten bad until I realize I'm basically gasping for air after a short walk. Then I have to take my rescue or a neb (or several) to loosen up again. I am also on a controller med, Wixela.(#5)what are your main symptoms from day to day ?

I wouldn't worry about a small inhaled dose of a perventer puffer. That is the least of your worries, it is like brushing you teeth and very little side effects.

but ya, I would want some more answers but don't fear the meds, if they can stop inflammation than it can stop you getting worse over time and feel better now.

not everyone gets full blown attacks but that doesn't mean they have mild asthma if it is persistent, some intermitted asthma people can actually get ugly attacks.

it is completely different for everyone, follow you doctors advice, take your meds for now, while you try to figure out what triggers you.

your grandma probalby would have been better off if she had daily but she old now.(#6)I was diagnosed recently with asthma as an adult. Took me 9 months for diagnosis because symptoms were mild, and attacks were so small I didn't consider them attacks. After my diagnosis I was given a peak flow meter. They told me to chart my peak flow, that way I could tell when I need a higher dose of control medicine. I feel good right now without medicine, but if my peak flow starts going down it's a good indication I should start taking control inhaler again.

Not a doctor."

Steroids are a safer short term option than abusing your emergency inhaler,26,0.96,16,"(#1)Wow, that‚Äôs so true. Here in USA i used to get severe asthma attacks during season change. And I remember my uncle (Internal medicine Doctor) used to give me a week course of Prednisone (steroids) along with nebulizer treatments. I do recall during those time i required less usage of my rescue Ventolin or Provental inhalers. I have gone slightly better on my asthma attacks but now my asthma lower down to sport induced asthma(#2)There have definitely been some times where I've used my emergency inhaler 5-15 times in a day despite being on Advair, Singulair, and a shit load of different allergy meds. And I always nebulize when I can, but I often don't have asthma attacks at home.

Granted, most of that emergency inhaler use was from me playing sports. But I think it's very possible for someone to be doing everything ""right"" and still having wildly uncontrolled asthma. I personally found that Advair didn't do a whole lot for me.

Also, cough drops in constantly.(#3)I‚Äôve had a chest physio recently to help me with clearing mucus and she suggesting the huffing method which people with cystic fibrosis use. I do this after my shower and I turn the temperature right up so the air is steamy or I have put a towel over my head over a bowl of hot water (only do this if you can sit down or when you try and stand up you can get very light headed) which helps loosen up the mucus before I try this

Here‚Äôs a link to the instructions for the huffing thing. It can take a bit of practice and will feel uncomfortable at times but it‚Äôs been super helpful for me. https://prod-test.cff.org/Life-With-CF/Treatments-and-Therapies/Airway-Clearance/Coughing-and-Huffing/

Another important thing for me is antihistamines. I currently take montelukast and fexofenadine and I also use a nasal spray (fluticasone furoate is the medicine in it, others I‚Äôve tried have made my asthma worse so be careful with this). If I miss my tablets in the evening I always wake up with loads of phlegm on my chest and I‚Äôll be coughing up crap for days until it settles down again(#4)Do you have a nebulizer? That helps me cough up phlegm and just have a more productive than dry cough in general. If not, steam can also help. Take an extra long hot shower, drink some hot water with lemon, and run a humidifier if you have one.

One thing that may help is breathing in through your nose and then exhaling slowly through pursed lips. I find that helps calm down my breathing a bit when I get anxious about it.

I'd recommend getting hold of a cheap nebuliser and use saline solution though it will help loosen the gunk so you can cough it up."
"Admitted to ER. Asthma gone bad, hand and feet paralysis, low potassium in blood, possibly due to overdose on inhaler",18,0.95,17,"(#1)Ventolin is Albuterol Sulfate. It is a short-acting beta-2-agonist. It works as a bronchodilator by relaxing the muscles lining the airways - this smooth muscle has beta-2-receptors which the drug targets. Activating beta-2-receptors also affects potassium channels.

Your cells in your body have these little pumps or channels that transport sodium and potassium. Your body uses these substances to generate action potential - aka tiny electrical signals used in your nerves, muscles, and heart. Maintaining the right levels of these substances helps your body function, in ways such as being able to move your limbs and your heart being able to beat at its normal rhythm.

When there is *too much* albuterol sulfate in your body, then your cells are told to take up more potassium from your bloodstream. This leaves you in a state of hypokalemia - low potassium. 

During times of low potassium, some symptoms you may feel are shallow breaths,  confusion, fatigue, abnormal heart rhythm, muscle cramps, weakness, or even paralysis like you experienced in your hands.

Your potassium was low as a direct result of taking too much albuterol sulfate too quickly!

It's important to recognize the dosage limits of any drug. [here](https://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/Ventolin-HFA-albuterol-sulfate-234.3100) is a really thorough info page about the proper dose of albuterol sulfate. For adults, the FDA recommends no more than 12 puffs/day. 

In the long term, it's important for you to adjust your asthma management. For example, you might want to get on a long-acting drug such as Advair (there are numerous options). Talk to your doctor or even see a pulmonologist. Once your asthma is maintained, you will ideally need to use your rescue inhaler much less. Preventing emergencies is a big part of managing asthma.

Let me know if I left any questions unanswered. I will try my best.(#2)In the US generally call 911 if you need to go to the ER.  In your case that would probably have been a better choice.

Other reminder... I hear people sometimes talking about a lot of rescue inhaler use.  My doctor told me no more then once on 4 hours or something like that.  Also if your using it more then a few times a week see your doctor and get a med change.  Not really suppose to use or need rescue inhaler much.(#3)i was close to that. I got a overdoses, I was about a heart attack cause of adrenaline. 

The problem I did was that the more adrenaline I got in my body the most oxygen was demanding my body, so even in the sofa I was sweating like I ran a marathon, my body was simply out of control. Also the problem is that initially I didn't feel anything special, then all of the sudden the adrenaline kicked me.

Honestly I might die that day, is the only once that I got an experience like that. So yeah, be careful with that(#4)My daughter was on continuous albuterol for 4 days in the ICU. She was also receiving IV potassium and Magnesium. High amounts of albuterol will cause your potassium to decrease as discussed in the earlier comment.(#5)‚Äú8-10 puffs normal‚Äù fuck I slam way more than that lately.(#6)My son was switched to symbicort from flovent. I thought once on symbicort you no longer use ventolin bc symbicort is also used as a rescue? I was told no more albuterol, just do an extra puff of symbicort as needed but no more than 4 a day. I confirmed with asthma nurse and dr since symbicort insert states its not to be used as a rescue. I was told the insert is outdated. Symbicort has the long acting albuterol type in it.(#7)ive experienced something similar last january. chest and throat tightness, struggling to breathe, tingly and numbing sensation in my hands, legs and face. now im worried i have an undiagnosed asthma"
Is there a drug like Singular that causes less side effects?,1,0.67,10,"(#1)what side effects have you experienced? I take it as well. 

my friends have had success with advair(#2)My daughter was borderline psychotic after 4 weeks of Singulair. Dupixent is now the maintenance of choice.(#3)I had to go off Singulair. Constant suicidal thoughts... Like a drum beat. A week after off it was gone (it had been a year of that)."
Is glutathione a risk for asthma patients?,1,0.67,1,"(#1)It‚Äôs can cause bronchoconstriction if inhaled through a nebulizer, not when taken orally or via IV.

Will lung capacity ever improve?,15,1.0,28,"(#1)Have you tried a lung exerciser? They exercise your lungs naturally. I got one a couple of years ago and I've found I no longer wheeze and I can take much deeper breaths. There are various brands available eg Power Breathe and Air Physio.(#2)What sport are you doing?

Imo asthma and lung capacity are somewhat different. My asthma might always be there but conditioning improves my overall aerobic capacity massively. Asthma acts as a gatekeeper that doesn't allow me to use that capacity at times, so I have to manage and mitigate my asthma to open the gates to my aerobic capacity. That's how I look at. The asthma is always a factor but my conditioning helps me out in spite of it(#3)I sympathise with you. It must be frustrating, knowing you are doing everything right and still you are suffering like this.

I can only suggest a referral to a respiratory specialist who specialises in asthma and see if they can help you.

There may be a rehab program that has a range of therapies that can help improve lung function.

I was due to start a rehab program myself, but COVID has thrown that into disarray for now.

As far as your coach and team mates go, that is very poor attitude on their part. They clearly have no idea what it is like to struggle for air. They certainly have no right to criticise and you don't need to justify your existence to anyone. All you can do is try to explain what you are struggling with. You are chronically ill and you are doing your best with the health problems you have.

I have chronic severe asthma in conjunction with a chronic auto-immune disease called pulmonary sarcoidosis. It has effectively left me disabled and I can't seem to get that through to family members, because to them, I ""look perfectly fine"". In actual fact, I'm far from being fine.

I wish you all the best and hope you find a solution.(#4)I'm 21 myself, worked at a Distribution Center for about a year and a half as an order filler. Very high intensity job where you gotta move fast for about 12-16 hours a day. Lost about 55 pounds working there, asthma never improved even a little. So for me it's never gotten better.(#5)I think you're trying to make a correlation between increased lung capacity and improved asthma and honestly the 2 don't really correlate. I have had severe chronic asthma all my life and used to think too that when I got older and my lungs were stronger then my asthma would improve too but that wasnt the case.

Asthma is triggered by 5 factors and that's allergies, excercise, sickness(almost always chest infections), stress and cold air. If you have severe asthma then any of these triggers are going to result in a bad asthma attack.

I have no doubt that your lung capacity is way better than it was before you started your exercise regime. But since exercise is a major trigger it doesn't matter how strong your lungs are, it still will trigger an asthma attack. On top of it, the sports you have chosen in basketball and Ju Jitsu are 2 of the most cardiac intensive activities you can do. Whenever I wrestled with friends or my brother I would be done in like 2 minutes because of my asthma. 

But what I did find out is that the more in shape I was, while it wouldn't stop the attack from happening, my recovery time was shorter and usually if I just took a hit of inhaler and rested for maybe 5 or 10 minutes than I was ok and good to go again.

Keep doing the sports if that's what makes you happy and just find ways around your asthma but i would forget the idea that doing the sports will improve your asthma because in my experience it hasnt(#6)You may not be on the right controller med. It is really trial and error to find the med that works best.(#7)Warm up slower. You also need to warm up your lungs before strenuous exercise. So you should warm up at an intensity that causes your breathing to deepen just slightly.(#8)I've always had asthma but also had tachycardia. Resting HR could easily be 100. I started HIIT training. It sounds hardcore but it's based on HR. Once the HR reaches the desired level maintain it briefly then bring it down on purpose. In HIIT training I had a hard time bringing it down and had to walk slowly. Anyway now I'm 55 and my resting HR is between 80-85. It really helped a lot with cardiovascular health and had fast and long lasting results. 

I haven't trained in over a year and still maintain a healthy HR, I believe due to years of on and off HIIT training. My back is currently making it difficult to walk. With asthma and many things it's hard to maintain because of getting sick and having exacerbations in between. It's always been a part of the process of having to stop training then start back up again for me.(#9)Aerobic capacity is influenced by more than lung function and can be trained to a certain degree.  You'll always be limited by your genetics but improvements can be made.

If you're exercising and get the asthma attack feeling, I'd take a puff from the emergency inhaler.  If you feel like your heart rate is too high and body is telling you to stop, that might improve with cardio training.  Maybe try biking or running?  You might need to incorporate HIIT to help see some gains.  Basketball is ok but might lack the intensity to produce any substantial aerobic gains.

Aerobic capacity is primarily influenced by lung capacity, red blood cells and the circulatory system, and the mitochondria in  the muscles.  It's how much oxygen your body can pull in, how quickly it gets to the muscles and how efficiently your muscles can use it.

World class endurance athletes can operate at very high levels of intensity in an aerobic state.  The guy who ran the sub 2 hour marathon can run at over 13 mph and operate at 95 of his max heart rate for two hours.(#10)It will get better! Continue to give your concerns and work your lungs regularly. My lung function was at 40% for yeaaarrrsss. I thought it would never improve on preventative. I ended up starting a biologic after years of thinking i was a controlled as i could get and now my lung function has increased to 80%.(#11)you can always try the lung trainers, as for me my asthma has gotten worse as ive gotten older. everyone is different though, my only other advice would be talk to your dr about seeing a lung specialist.(#12)You might just be doing the wrong kind of excercise. Cardio is not necessarily going to help lung capacity. Things like swimming and singing are great excercise for increasing lung capacity. You can also get lung excercise things that you breathe against resistance.(#13)possible -

Hyperventalition syndrome. - Pretty common with asthmatics.

very common.

basically you over breathe and take in to much 02 and lose to much carbon dioxide. You get the same symptoms like a panic , dizzy, weak blah blah.

think of when you feel like you would faint when's fight or flight kicks in, that is because we breathe to0 fast, to deep. our bodies get ready to extra o2 to fight to the death.

It is possible with all your inhalers and huffing and puffin you are breathing way to fast,

a good test, for me I don't want to kill you, is to do it in a chair, over breathe for a few minutes, see how awful you feel.

now you are probalby running around the field thinking OMG I got to breathe as much and as fast as I can, panting.. holy shit man, that will knock anyone out.

We don't need to be breath as often or much as we think, try to breath ONLY through your nose as much as possible as it warms the air and limits our intake.

It might not be your thing BUT, some people that should like have found a total cure for sport just breathing right."
Symbicort question of side effects,2,1.0,3,"(#1)That happened to me as well on symbicort, after a few weeks I got a bad asthma attack after taking it. Then tried Dulera and the same thing happened. Turn out my body doesn't like the formoterol. My dr then switched me to Breo and I've been great since."
Asthma testing - how are inhalers meant to feel?,0,0.5,2,"(#1)Preventative inhalers often take a couple weeks to start working. Honestly I didn‚Äôt realize just how much my Qvar was helping until I ran out after taking it for a few months and couldn‚Äôt afford another. Beta 2 agonists for me personally take about 30 mins - 1 hour to do anything. And then I cough up half a lung worth of gunk and feel better.(#2)If you need the rescue inhaler multiple times a day, you should talk to your doctor about going on a controller med."
Effective treatment of allergic airway inflammation with Helicobacter pylori,1,1.0,0,
First sports-induced asthma flareup in 6 years.,8,1.0,8,"(#1)I hear this!  I just flared myself up shovelling snow this past weekend and couldn't get back on top of my breathing despite repeated attempts to use salbutamol and slow/calm breathing for 60 hours until I went to a walk-in clinic and was prescribed a benzo!  Which worked.  SMH.

Doc said I had a legit asthma flare-up (likely from exertion in -11C weather) but then anxiety and exhaustion took over, hence the elephant that refused to get off my chest for two days.  What I can't believe is that the benzo is what stopped the attack.  It goes to show how interconnected asthma and stress/anxiety are.  I know it was real asthma, though, because once I could breathe normally again I coughed up a fair amount of sputum over the next day.

OP, interesting to know the antihistamine helped.  I wonder if it's because they dry you out?  (Given that your attack was perhaps exercise induced, not environmental allergy induced, in theory).

40 years as an asthmatic and I still don't have it figured out.  My respirologist keeps reminding me asthma changes through your life and has periods of flares and remissions, as well as changing symptoms.(#2)How long has it been since you've gone running?

If you're in the northern hemisphere, allergy season is beginning. Also, check the air quality. If it's a poor air quality day, it can trigger asthma type symptoms while running."

What to look out for when hospital is needed for asthma attack,22,1.0,40,"(#1)I‚Äôm not a DR but I am familiar with EMT protocol and dyspnea (or not being able to talk from shortness of breath) is a RED FLAG issue. 

That means go to the ER or call 911 immediately.(#2)My child doesn‚Äôt always have audible wheezing with asthma attacks. Often it is just the cough and shortness of breath. I‚Äôd be concerned enough at your son‚Äôs shortness of breath to see a dr now. You can also look at his work of breathing - see if he has sucking in of the skin around his ribs and at the throat.  That is a sign of serious asthma that needs urgent attention. How is he sitting now? If leaning forward on his knees like a ‚Äòtripod‚Äô that is also a sign that he is finding it harder to breathe. 
Asthma is a bit of a learning curve, I found. I got told off for not calling an ambulance in the early days, but you will get better at knowing. Ask your dr for a written asthma action plan so you know exactly what do as his asthma gets worse. Good luck and just remember that it‚Äôs better to see a Dr if you are concerned at all than to leave it too long. (PS Lethargy or passing out is much too late, so don‚Äôt wait for that! My child was still chatting to me on the way to hospital where triaged straight through and admitted for a few days on oxygen‚Ä¶ children can hide it well!)(#3)As an asthmatic who almost never wheezes: Please do not wait for wheezing as a sign of serious asthma, some of us just don't wheeze.(#4)Can you ask him to sing his favorite song right now? Is he able to do it without coughing or getting his words out?(#5)There is no excuse to not have a pulse Ox they are available at any Wal mart, drug store, Amazon, you should own 7 of them. They should be in you car, your purse, your home. Please buy a pulse ox.(#6)From my sons experience the o2 reader wasn‚Äôt reliable. He had a minor asthma attack, I checked his o2 level and it was reading between 80-82 (he seemed ok). I freaked out and raced him to the hospital. O2 levels were absolutely fine there, and he was ok. The doctor did mention that those at home oxygen readers are more of a headache than anything for toddler sized fingers and won‚Äôt give an accurate reading. 

If he isn‚Äôt improving, take him to the doctor/ hospital, asthma can creep up so quickly :((#7)Sorry to ask, has he been given nebulizer treatments? I used to get them during my childhood in ER back in 80‚Äôs-90‚Äôs. Not a doctor but sharing my experience. Keep an eye for things which triggers asthma, for me it was gum, bananas, Cheetos, any minty flavor edibles which triggers my asthma. Till the age of 15 i was not able to eat bananas. 

Please be patient with you kido, its not fun with asthma but he will grow out it.(#8)Might have something to do with this since you mention vomiting: https://www.verywellhealth.com/do-i-have-asthma-and-reflux-200882

*A common side effect of corticosteroids is indigestion - which can cause an asthma attack* per the initial article above [and other sources here](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=asthmatic+symptoms+heartburn&ia=web).  A solution could be avoiding corticosteroids and finding an alternative and/or treating GERD primarily and asthma if needed after that.

Pulmicort can also cause cough/hoarseness if not rinsing the mouth with water after each inhalation.

You might also be interested in reading this regarding nutrients depleted by asthma medications including budesonide (Pulmicort): https://healingwithnutrition.com/adisease/asthma/asthmadrugs.html

Long-term, nutrient depletion can start causing issues that resemble mental issues such as anxiety and depression that would require further medication if you didn't know the root cause.  If there's no alternative to taking corticosteroids then it would be worthwhile to supplement the nutrients indicated via diet or vitamins.

Is this asthma?,0,0.5,1,(#1)This is not asthma.
"Is it normal for FEV1,FVC and F2575 to drop after stopping with Symbicort for a few months and only taking Salbutamol?",1,1.0,12,"(#1)It's completely normal because the inflammation is coming back with a vengeance. All Salbutamol does is mask the inflammation. 

You are going to need to go back on the ICS and get used to the idea that you need the meds.(#2)Yes it is normal if you have asthma. Your lungs are probably inflamed, and when you were taking Symbicort, the steroid in it kept the inflammation down. If you go too long with untreated asthma, your lungs could get permanently damaged. I‚Äôd keep taking the Symbicort if I were you. Do you feel a difference?"
Help,0,0.5,2,"(#1)It can be scary getting a diagnosis but on the other hand, if you do have asthma it's reassuring to have the proper meds to help you out with exercise or if you have a flare up. 

I bet they will measure your lung capacity and it's basically only blowing air into a measuring device without an inhaler and then you get to try it with puffs from an inhaler to see if there's any difference. So the examination is easy and not so scary. Contact a doctor, you got this :)(#2)You NEED to go see a doctor. My parents found out I had asthma when I completely couldn't breathe and passed out in the kitchen when I was 12. I spent 2 weeks in the hospital with 5 days on a ventilator."
I‚Äôve had a very slight whistling sound on exhale for a couple years now. No real issue breathing (had bad asthma as a kid that went away) but wondering if its time to be concerned?,3,1.0,3,"(#1)It's possible. Doesn't happen often these days, but I've had squeaky lungs from asthma in the past. It's like there's just a bit of phlegm in my lungs that can be heard as either a squeak or cracking when I exhale all the way. When in doubt, talk to your doctor!(#2)I‚Äôd check with a doctor. From what I understand asthma doesn‚Äôt just go away, it rather goes dormant from time to time. Plus, sometimes people don‚Äôt notice any symptoms. I had times where I subjectively felt my asthma was controlled, but lung function test showed otherwise. The best is to regularly check with your doctor to avoid a dangerous attack(#3)I‚Äôm dealing with this exact same thing right now, so thank you for posting about it! I hope you got some more clarity on it, I‚Äôm having some health anxiety about this because I don‚Äôt *always* have that slight wheezing noise on exhale, but I noticed after being out in the super cold and windy weather two days ago and walking up a steep ass sf hill at the same time, I was rly short of breath and I‚Äôm tying in the wheezing to that now lol üò≠ I‚Äôm breathing fine as well still despite that, but the slight noise on exhale is freaking me out a little too even though I‚Äôve had it prior to the trigger (I assume) of me walking in the cold under exertion :/

Alvesco Experiences?,1,1.0,14,"(#1)I loved Alvesco because I had zero side effects.  Unfortunately my insurance wouldn't cover it even though i failed 4 others.

But its working so I haven't bothered to test to see if my new insurance covers it.(#2)I used it for about 6 months, didn't notice any side effects at all. I did read an article 2 that said that it is helpful in preventing covid(#3)Didn‚Äôt work for me, but Qvar does.(#4)My child started on Qvar, switched to Alvesco and later to Symbicort (combined med). Asthma has been super well controlled on Symbicort combined with Singulair so we haven‚Äôt looked at moving back to just an ICS like Alvesco. For what it‚Äôs worth I think we started on Qvar because it was ok for kids over 4 (although we started younger). Alvesco was ok for over 12 (although again we started much younger). Used to get a bit of oral thrush with Alvesco due to lack of mouth rinsing, but otherwise wasn‚Äôt anything particular to mention about being on it compared to anything else. We just needed to step up to get good control.(#5)I lost my insurance for a period of time so I was buying inhalers off Craigslist and OfferUp.

As far as I know (and I don't know a lot and I am not scientist or doctor) they somehow take your stem cells and put them back in your body. But it's all just being researched.

So I totally get it. I have rx for 3 puffers and singulair.  I find singulair is the most helpful.  

I just want to give an advice about something that I tried and helped me with symptoms relief.  Try cupping therapy along with acupuncture.  Do it with a knowledgeable practitioner.  The fire cupping is very helpful cuz it has more deeper penetration of the soft tissue and helps with chest expansion.  

I find it , it gives a lot of symptomatic relief especially if u keep doing it on regular basis. 

Most importantly follow with your doctor and be compliant with your medications. Exercise as tolerated on regular basis. Do deep breathing exercises too.(#19)There is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs called Flovent. And the cure to the pain on your Wallet from Flovent is inhousepharmacy or alldaychemist"
Running in PE,90,0.99,67,"(#1)PE fucking sucked. 

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really do this without my inhaler on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, you have to keep all medications in the nurse‚Äôs office.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay but I can‚Äôt breathe.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou look fine to me.  Get out there.‚Äù(#2)They always made us run on a field with freshly cut grass. It was torture. They really should have alternative accommodations for asthmatics in PE. Like maybe a stationary bike instead of running on a grassy field.(#3)That's horrible and complete bs. Everyone's asthma is different. Running can trigger mine pretty bad too. I wish I had done more physical activity in middle and high school because it does help my asthma in the long term, however things as strenuous as running especially should always be optional.(#4)My PE teacher had astma. She told me exercising more would help. Which technically it would have, but I would've had to exercise smartly, not run until I wheezed, hurt and hated running.

Seriously the teacher didn't even teach good running form. My legs would hurt like hell after PE class and I learned off the internet it was probably because I struck with my heels instead of rolling my foot. 

Sorry for the rant.(#5)I didn't know I was asthmatic at school - I didn't get diagnosed until my 20s so just got told I was unfit over and over again. Like, okay, definitely not the fittest person ever (though I've never been overweight in the slightest) but come on?? Not being able to breathe and it hurting to breathe so much after such a short distance seemed unlikely to be just down to being unfit. Asthma runs on my mums side of the family really clearly, I'm fairly sure my mum has asthma - she has a clear wheezy asthma cough when it's cold in particular- but she seems in denial for no particular reason, so yeah, lots of 'it's not that bad' when I was complaining I couldn't breathe in PE.

I think running's not ideal/good for everyone, especially if you're asthmatic. I like swimming, cycling, hiking. I like to say to people now that I don't even run for the bus (and I don't).(#6)Try taking an allergy pill like Claritin about half an hour before running. It works for me. It prevents the asthma from happening somehow(#7)PE in hs is the reason I didn‚Äôt have a 4.0. That nasty little hobbit woman didn‚Äôt believe I needed my inhaler.(#8)I still remember my mom‚Äôs friend telling my mom that I don‚Äôt have asthma and I‚Äôm just out of shape and lazy.

Fuck you Mrs. B I beat your best marathon time by an hour and 45 minutes you bitch. Anyhow I‚Äôm clearly over it.(#9)I was allowed to keep my inhaler, but running wasn‚Äôt a thing i could do, and dusty stank ass gym mats made me wheeze.

i finally got an exemption to the PE bullshit, and graduated HS. Thus far in life i‚Äôve never needed any of the supposed skills from PE, or the sociopathic PE teachers.(#10)I believe running in PE was fully traumatic for me. I live sports in general, but hated running because of my asthma. Only problem is that I got originally diagnosed at 4 and then at 22 because my new dance teacher made me go get checked (am now 24).

In between ages 8-19 my parents believed that I had outgrown my asthma, had no inhalers and therefore had to participate in PE. I took up casual running a year ago, never too much and pacing myself so I don‚Äôt go into an attack. When I was at my parents last summer, I came back from running and had a minor attack and my parents nearly called an ambulance. I told them I‚Äôve lived like this since middle school. This is how I ended any run that had to be timed.

They said they had no idea. For the most part I blame my general doctor and not my parents. But it was shitty they never really listened or believed me(#11)My daughter has anaphylactic reactions to exercise. She has a 504 plan, but every year we'd have to deal with another PE teacher who would suggest clean eating, CBD oil, other oils, or talk about making a plan to gradually build up my daughter's endurance so she could exercise safely (she can't). Our first allergist suggested yoga and taking two Benadryl first, but that just resulted in my daughter falling asleep in some weird and uncomfortable poses. The allergist we go to now said she could write another letter or the PE teachers could call her with questions. Once we started telling them to just contact the doctor, they took it more seriously.

I appreciate the idea that everyone can and should exercise, but I think sometimes it's taken too far.(#12)The only time I've ever had detention is when the PE coach decided I was being lazy and didn't want to run a zillion miles just for his entertainment.(#13)Get a doctor's note.(#14)I'm in highschool now and I have PE I'm term 3 and 4 I am far from excited as it's apparently not a valid excuse or I'm lying when they can see my record of it...(#15)It is absolute bullshit! I'm sorry you had to go through that :((#16)same but im proud i can run a bunch of miles now despite my condition actually getting worse. took a ton of training and better meds tho. not just being thrown onto and bullied on the highschool track(#17)The amount of times in elementary school I had to leave for home early because of my asthma during p.e. was insane. I just gave up on participating in middle school and avoided it till my senior year in highschool and took it online.(#18)I wish physical education had focused more on the educatuon, especially in lone exercising. I learned the rules football, baseball and a bit about map reading. But  I've would wanted to learn running technique, lifting and how to get better at a reasonable pace.

It felt like there was more emphasis on team stuff and slamming into your physical boundaries. Or the teacher went off for a smoke and left us to figure it out for ourselves.

I feel like I learned I suck at physical stuff and will always suck. Then I got into medium weights because I got tired of having my ass kicked by the grocerie bags.(#19)Get paperwork done. 504. Hold them to the wall with legal action. That's the only way I made it through middle + high school.
#
If/when I have children and they turn out the same as me I'm filing it immediately. I'm not letting them suffer what I've suffered.(#20)my high school was chill about it until i started having anxiety about it when my asthma was okay and i didnt want to participate(#21)I‚Äôm a bit of a clutz so I‚Äôd would rarely have my rescue inhaler and I almost never took my advir everyday like I was supposed to. It‚Äôs my fault that I didn‚Äôt take my medicine, but it totally sucks running with an asthma attack and trying to get an 8 minute mile. Sorry I can‚Äôt run after when my lungs have turned into a fucking straw(#22)Why should it be an excuse? No one said you have to try to sprint the mile which is the mistake most kids do especially in PE.

I'm an almost 60 year old severe asthmatic and a distance runner."
Vent: NSAID‚Äôs sensitivity + sore back = sad me,3,0.8,9,"(#1)Talk about this with your doctor. You really should be avoiding medications that you're allergic to.(#2)I agree, talk to your doctor, but consider Tylenol in the mean time. The ""Arthritis strength"" they sell fucks your liver but works great(#3)If you're looking for help with inflammation, are you able to access CBD in your area? It has helped me immensely and I swear by it now."
When/how often should I use my inhaler while I wait for more testing?,3,1.0,4,"(#1)Use it when you feel like you need it. How often you need the rescue inhaler will help your doctor figure out which daily med you need, if you need one.(#2)Try not to overthink things. If you're noticing symptoms, use the inhaler. Slight wheezing when breathing normally could indicate that it'll progress to chest tightness and shortness of breath.

Keep track of how many times on average you're using the inhaler per day and tell the doctor when you see them next.(#3)If you feel you need it, take it. 100% worth avoiding an episode by catching it before it begins. The downside is shakiness and heart rate increase. Others around you won't believe the inhaler actually has drawbacks, but it absolutely does. Take your time to recover and prioritize your own health over the whims of others.(#4)Use it when you need it. It's nearly impossible to overdose on albuterol unless you're emptying the entire canister in one go. You know when your appointment is, and it'd be a good metric for your doc to see how often you're needing it."
Post asthma-attack exhaustion,4,0.83,4,"(#1)Normal. Take it easy and rest. It‚Äôs quite hard on the body, even the milder ones.(#2)Oh yes. Add on some pulled muscles from coughing too! Very normal for some of us. Not all, but some."
FINALLY DIAGNOSED!,4,1.0,2,(#1)Now I'm glad I got my diagnosis when I was a child (probably 3 or 4?). Good for you since asthma can be annoying and I couldn't think living without the meds
Difference between asthma attack and heart attack?,8,0.84,23,"(#1)I am curious too.  I asked my doctor that question years ago... I got the unhelpful answer of ""you will know"".... whatever that means.(#2)ER nurse here- the only way to know if it is a heart attack is diagnostic testing consisting of sn EKG, labs such as Troponin and CPK, and, for true confirmation, a cardiac cath. Symptoms alone are not definitive.

Asthma is a constriction of the airway.(#3)To me a severe asthma attack feels like breathing through a straw, it causes very elaborated breathing, that gets worse and worse. I also feel chest and back pain(#4)Not a medical professional but this can be related to GERD which gives you sharp pains in the chest, shortness of breath similar to heart attacks. Although this pain occurs on the right side of chest but anxiety makes it feel like a heart attack. Please have this checked out : GERd, sharing due to my personal experience.(#5)This is exactly what i had a few years back . it started with crazy coughing , wheezing , gasping for air then my throat closed , very mild anaphylactic like symptoms then the ‚Äú heart attack ‚Äú symptoms came . it was one of the scariest moments of my life(#6)Chest pain and weight on the chest means you should go to the Urgent Care.(#7)If u suffer from asthma panic and anxiety. Highly possible it could be esophagus spasms.  I get them with high anxiety and stress. Then anxiety can trigger asthma and vice versa. My dad had a heart attack.  Saud Worst pain you'll ever feel.  But my grandfather thought it was indigestion.  So only way to know for sure is er.(#8)I get this sensation as well and I panic a lot as my dad died of a heart attack when he was only 45. I had it last night really bad and had to talk myself into not calling an ambulance because the pressure wouldn‚Äôt ease. A doctor once explained how to know the difference: when you have a heart attack you will also probably be sick, be sweating, you really won‚Äôt be able to breathe, the pain won‚Äôt ease if you change your position and as said above you will definitely know. Unfortunately sometimes an asthma attack will feel very much like this but you must learn how to talk yourself down and relax so the symptoms ease.(#9)With an asthma attack I can feel my airways become ugh... sticky. I‚Äôd usually get massive back pain not usually chest pain though"
Serious asthma attacks,5,1.0,18,"(#1)Me!!! I have to do my neb 3-4x a day!(#2)Mine is awful sometimes and weird in general. I developed it while training for a triathlon 2 years ago at 26. I completed the triathlon  fortunately and I'm not sure if that's what caused it but anyway....I just feel terrible almost always. I'm on a ton of meds including xolair and 2 maintenance inhalers and Singulair. I don't have asthma attacks as obviously as some people I mostly just can never breathe right and it feels awful. Even with all the meds. So I understand and I am sorry you are going through this. Maybe one day there will be a cure or better medicine. If you haven't tried all the meds definitely do try them or switch to them(#3)I've been having 3-7 attacks per day because my triggers are smoke, vape and synthetic fragrances and I have been living in apartments where all neighbours do/use these things. I have tried everything to improve the situation from asking them nicely, begging to have rules/laws enforced, running multiple air purifiers, fans, ac all the time, prescriptions and naturopathic meds. I end up having to move every year or 2 because the other residents and mgmt all hate me for being the neighbour from hell, since I'm the only one with a problem. It's a holiday today and pouring rain so I'm just stuck here and  oh, yeah having an attack right now actually(#4)I really struggle in the winter, too.  What has helped me is keeping the vaporizer on and really having an indoor humidity gauge to really monitor the moisture levels in the house.  I also take Allegra every day and use Nasonex.  

If you aren't on something like Advair, you really need to be on it during your bad months.(#5)Do y'all ever just laugh a bit then asthma attacks come after...(#6)honestly if you have ‚Äú asthma ‚Äú and dont need to carry and inhaler you dont have asthma lmfao lately i cant even go to the mall without my inhaler cause i go into these crazy coughing fits , got to the point where my chest started tightening up . so like with me i can breathe during the night its like sometimes id wake up and these asthma flares would happen like every symptom in the book and the recovery period is a pain in the butt , laughing forget about it cause then ill experience shortness of breath , then i guess just a mild bacterial thing would set things off like crazy(#7)I would definitely go see an asthma specialist and get on a maintenance inhaler"
How do I hike with exercise induced asthma?,2,0.67,17,"(#1)Honestly, it takes time and practice to build up endurance for hiking.(#2)For exercise induced asthma, I take 2 puffs before activity. The key is to ease in slowly.

Also, you might not have the fitness yet. I can walk on flat forever but hikes are a different beast. So slowly building up your fitness in that would be helpful - introducing gentle cardio into your daily life - that including stepping up an incline ideally. 

If that doesn‚Äôt help, speak to your doc. If your asthma is controlled and your fitness level is good, then there shouldn‚Äôt be an issue.(#3)Are you on any preventative meds? Daily inhaler and something like Singulair for a couple of oaths straight (and beyond!) Should do you. Also albuterol nebulizer maybe right before you go may help keep your lungs open up. But definitely talk to your doctor(#4) I have the same issue, i need help too. I can walk miles in decent pace but when it comes to jog or run my exercise induced asthma jumps in and make me out of breath. And trust me i have been trying to improve my stamina for past 15+ yrs with No results(#5)It takes a long time for me to slowly build up my tolerance with exercise. Walk slower and exercise more regularly. I typically take 2-3 doses of my salbutamol about 20 minutes before I work out then take another 2 when I actually start to work out. When I initially start to feel the burn in my lungs, just slightly long before it gets too difficult to breathe, I slow down a lot and continue at that pace until my breathing has slowed down to a normal almost resting rate before I speed up again. The more often I work out the further I can go without needing to slow down. 
If I‚Äôm out for an hour or more then I will take another dose of my inhaler halfway.

I do have more severe asthma and rely heavily on preventer inhalers and antihistamines but even before my asthma was as bad as it is now this worked quite well for me you just might not need as high a dose of your reliever. Good luck!(#6)Do you exercise on a regular basis? If so, what type of exercise and how often?(#7)Hey! I have exercise induced asthma as well and I‚Äôve done a full Ironman after being diagnosed at 27, so hopefully I have a little experience in this. 

One thing my doctor said was to pretreat with the albuterol 20-30 minutes before doing something that will cause my asthma attacks, like running.  I suggest giving that try. 

I know you said you don‚Äôt want to add in a daily medication for something you don‚Äôt do very often, but I‚Äôd suggest still talking to your doctor about the hiking. 

The last one you may not like, and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm struggling with now. You may just be out of shape. Personally I took 2 years off exercising almost. I‚Äôm getting back into it and running was awful. My chest and lugs were dying quickly, but now that I think on it I may just have been out of shape. As I‚Äôve continued it‚Äôs getting better. Back to the point of only needing the pretreatment for running. So idk if this is it or not, but there are lots of possibilities.(#8)I was asymptomatic for years then went on a hike in the  steep hills. First up hill my breath started wheezing and my pipes clogged up. Luckily I had antihistamine pills with me. Took one and that helped.

Though my exercise induced asthma may be due to another illness which weakens muscles and I have a lot of mucus in my throat. Results may wary."
So what do we do in an apocalypse?,3,0.72,4,"(#1)we're screwed, but still going to try to run from the zombies(#2)Look into ephedra as a plant that can be  grown and has bronchiodiolating qualities. As a stimulant (often use to make meth), ephedrine is a controlled substance on the U.S.,  but it's legal to have ephedra (can't speak to anywhere else).

Some research to backup its use in asthma patients. You can order seeds online,  though I haven't done so. 

Also,  as a stimulant there's the added bonus that it'll help keep you awake while you run from zombies.(#3)Mmm we die(#4)I'd probably go loot my nearest pharmacy soon as the outbreak starts. I might a well take my chances dying getting medicines cause I surely will if I dont lol."
Sore throat after maximum inhaler dose,1,0.67,3,"(#1)Oh forgot to mention, I have taken 6-8 dosages for 3 weeks now.(#2)Some inhalers are powder based, essentially acting as projectiles to the back of the throat. Using a spacer can mitigate the issue."
"Headed to Disneyland for four days, is Primatine good enough?",1,0.67,6,"(#1)Call you home pharmacy, if it‚Äôs a national chain they might have a pharmacy locally.  I know Costco pharmacy lets you pick up a prescription anywhere in the country.  

Worst case scenario call the concierge and asked for the nearest urgent care clinic.  See if they will give you a script.(#2)Find a pharmacy that'll deliver to the hotel you're staying at, and have your doctor call in a emergency script there.(#3)If you are using your albuterol more than 2-3 times a week, you need to get on the correct controller med. 

You do NOT want to use primatene if you suffer anxiety/panic because primatene is a massive stimulant.(#4)There‚Äôs a bunch of pharmacies in Anaheim near Disneyland. Have it transferred there, it‚Äôs rather easy.(#5)Just have the inhaler script sent to a pharmacy in CA. If you can find the same pharmacy there like if you use CVS or something and there is another location yoou can just call and have it transferred.(#6)Have you used primatene before??"
Do you guys briefly stop your meds when you get thrush?,9,0.92,12,"(#1)And be sure to rinse your mouth and gargle in your throat after every dose of the maintenance med :)(#2)I didn‚Äôt stop and wasn‚Äôt told to stop, and it cleared up for me just fine.(#3)Have you tried using a spacer device with your inhalers, as this can really help with reducing the risk of oral thrush and other localised side effects of steroid inhalers.(#4)Apart from gargling with saltwater, I would also eat some yogurt or drink probiotic everyday! It made thrush go away for me like a miracle.(#5)Call the pharmacy(#6)I gargle with salt water after each steroid inhaler dose when this happens. It helps immensely before the meds kick in.(#7)I don‚Äôt stop mine(#8)Make it a ritual to brush your teeth after.  But for now salt water.  Usually clears it up pretty quickly."
Starting Flovent side effects,1,1.0,10,"(#1)First thing is flovent will not help much during an acute attack. It's purpose is a preventative of future attacks. It doesn't really start working until 3 to 4 weeks of daily use.

Secondly, the itching sounds like a very uncommon side effect but maybe you're allergic to some of the carrier agents. I will say that it's a bit strange that you didn't have that reaction until 3 day and it's possible that it was triggered from something else.  Flovent should have little to no side effects you can readily feel.(#2)Call your doctor, tell them about these side effects, and find out what they want you to do."
How‚Äôs your emotional state when you‚Äôre having an asthma attack,24,0.92,17,"(#1)Yes, pretty much the same. I've always described it as a sense of impending doom. I feel quite mentally and emotionally drained afterwards too.(#2)I believe that anxiety also triggers asthma. And asthma makes you more prone to anxiety. It's like a cursed loop...(#3)Pretty much any time I'm feeling really depressed/anxious I look back on it afterwards and think 'dang, that may just have been me not breathing properly without knowing it'(#4)Obv I have major anxiety in the moment but afterwards I just feel drained and pessimistic. Very tired, and understandably so bc your body was fighting pretty hard. It‚Äôs also just that feeling of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want that to ever happen again but I know it will‚Äù(#5)Depression is heavy for me as asthma holds me back from a lot of things, and I know I keep my boyfriend back from living adventurously as well... it is a ""blame myself"" depression (even if I can't really control my asthma attacks much).

He does what he can to cheer me up but it is tough.(#6)Usually just total apathy like I don't have the energy to feel anything.  Any time I used to feel stressed or depressed there was nothing like having an asthma attack to cure me of that.(#7)Anxious for me(#8)I definitely get agitated quickly(#9)I just feel tired and annoyed, that's about it(#10)I feel like that too. I feel heavy, weighed down, slow, and melancholic. A sense of dread. Sometimes I get scared.(#11)Same, i went into this BPD mode and depressed state ‚Ä¶(#12)For some reason I get pissed as fuck never sad or scared(#13)During sneak attacks, usually the 1st of the day, I feel low, nothing works right, I get scatterbrained and clumsy and feel bad about everything before realising I'm not breathing well enough. 
It may be a gradually worsening lack of oxygen that can make people feel depressed, slow, generally icky.
During the more intense attacks, which are usually subsequent to sneaks because exposure to triggers continues, I'm like a crazy person before, during and after; I get super irritable and can have a meltdown which can be angry or sobbing."
Hey Asthma Subreddit pharmacist with a question,8,0.79,56,"(#1)I mean instead of doing this, why not look at the cost to buy the drugs from your supplier and not do an insane markup?

Goodrx will also tell you the going prices in your area.(#2)Generic doesn‚Äôt exist for my son‚Äôs inhaler. Flovent HFA 110 mcg. $265/month.(#3)I‚Äôve paid $70/albuterol inhaler with Anthem Blue Cross and $5 with Covered CA/Kaiser; all generic. My epi-pen was $5 with insurance (generic) but would be ~$300 without (still generic). 

Away from asthma, I know people that would have to pay about $1,000/mo for life saving insulin if they lost their insurance; I don‚Äôt think insulin has a generic, but it‚Äôs awful that some will actually die without it, but may be rationing it because of prices. Some mental health medications are gouged as well; aripiprazole (generic Abilify) and some other antipsychotics/atypical antidepressants. 

Not as big of an advertised issue in the US (but still an issue nonetheless) is antiparasitics. Not because of COVID ‚Äúcures,‚Äù but because the market can inflate these prices to whatever they want. Catch toxoplasmosis from your cat‚Äôs litterbox (which ~1/3 of the world‚Äôs population has likely been infected at one point) BUT need pyrimethamine? Hope you have $750/tablet. Interesting article here: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsoc.2020.540478/full

Edit: Also, I live in CA.(#4)I pay $5.60 for any *script* that is PBS (generic or brand name), maximum of $300 per year then free. Am an Australian pensioner, different countries apparently charge differently.

Note: some scripts are for 2 salbutamol, or 5 packs of something, the whole script is $5.60.(#5)With my insurance I pay $15 for my albuterol and the same for a one month supply of montelukast sodium. My Qvar redihaler costs $235 for the first one and because of how my insurance works they cost $15/ea for the rest of the year.(#6)I‚Äôm in VA. If I didn‚Äôt have insurance, I would pay 60-80 for Ventolin(#7)I don‚Äôt have insurance and my inhaler is $60-$80.(#8)i am on airomir for a rescue inhaler and i pay nothing . im also on flovant and pay nothing as well . airomir i believe is a generic version i believe for one of the rescues(#9)This is so crazy to me. Healthcare prices are really something else in the US aren't they... I don't live in the US and I pay about $1 for albuterol. (I know this isn't relevant for OP, it's just shocking how big the difference is)

Edit: $0.28 !! Not even one dollar.
A McDonalds cheeseburger for example is about $1.28 here, for reference :D(#10)I have Blue Cross Blue Shield but unless I meet my deductible my insurance doesn‚Äôt really cover or reduce the price of drugs at the pharmacy. I‚Äôll still find myself getting a better price with GoodRx, unfortunately. 

For albuterol inhaler I‚Äôll pay about $20-$30 per inhaler. 

For advair, I‚Äôll pay $80-90 for each diskus. 

For nebulizing solution (albuterol) I‚Äôll pay about $10 for a box of 30 vials. 

On my current plan, when I reach my deductible of 3k, essentially full cost of prescriptions and doctor visits/services are covered entirely. I ask my dr and pharmacist for a 90 day supply if possible around the end of the year when the deductible resets and they usually have no issue doing so.(#11)Unless you are an actual licensed pharmacist, you won't be opening a pharmacy.(#12)SoCal. I use GoodRx. I think my generic albuterol was about $25. My Advair generic was about $150.(#13)Michigan. No insurance. With goodrx I pay $30 Albuterol inhaler, $30 for 50 nebulizer vials, $11 for monetelukast but when I was on insurance I use singular inhaler and it was $300 no insurance but I paid $40 with insurance. Stopped purchasing advair and generic advair because it is $250 and $150 each and that's just too much for me even though advair by far was the best long term preventer I have used.(#14)I have Harvard Pilgrim and live in MA, I pay $20/ month for albuterol sulfate and $20/ month for Symbicort (unsure of dosages but I know it‚Äôs the lowest one for Symbicort based off what my pulmonologist said); I am comfortable with this pricing. 

I‚Äôd personally love to see generic EpiPens and nebulizer vials, including DuoNebs. (Also insulin, which is ridiculously expensive and I‚Äôm glad I personally don‚Äôt need it because I would never be able to afford it.) 

I want to say thank you for your effort you‚Äôre putting into this, as the price of medications in the USA is astronomically marked up and so unaffordable for many people."
"Mild asthma but only acts up when allergies, weather, perfume and cologne,Etc.",3,0.8,4,"(#1)I had more episodes of asthma when I'm stressed. Tons more.(#2)i have moderate asthma ( originally diagnosed ) but for the last few years my asthma was quite mild and did act up with stress and i dealt with flare ups cause of it .  However , please keep in mind stress can really play a part with your diagnosis changing . my asthms went from moderate to mild and now its near moderate again(#3)Stress and periods definitely. Hormones also flare my migraines, although now that my asthma is more or less controlled the come much less often."
Asthma Supplies,1,0.67,2,"(#1)You deal with asthma when your away exactly the same way you would at home. If you are using your rescue medication more than 2-3 times a week, you need to see your doctor. This means that your asthma is not in control and he needs to adjust your meds.

For the majority of asthmatics, once they are on the right controller med, they rarely need the rescue inhaler.(#2)I have this one and it‚Äôs so quiet!

Excerise induced asthma,6,0.88,7,"(#1)Yeah it certainly could be. I have regular asthma but one indicator of it I experienced that is also an indicator for exercise-induced asthma was feeling out of shape when you‚Äôre fit. Like I was always an athletic kid, pretty lean and played a few sports. But I couldn‚Äôt keep up with things like running drills and stuff like that as well as the other kids could bc I was having trouble breathing. It was worse in the cold and I used to produce a TON of mucus which was another indicator of it, so I was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma which was later changed to moderate asthma. Now I‚Äôm on maintenance and rescue inhalers daily. The thing about asthma is it changes and can come on later than childhood, so you developing it at 22 could be just a regular thing of asthma or maybe another lung issue or allergies. Def see someone for it to be sure and to start a treatment plan so you can be as active as you want (within reason).(#2)When I was a kid I was very fit and played on a football team. But during the winter the cold air always hurt my chest, and over the years it transformed into full asthma. While my asthma is relatively mild and controlled, cold weather is still a killer so I avoid running outdoors during the winter and instead run on a treadmill.

Go to your doctor and he‚Äôll decide what inhaler you should be taking if you need one. It will make a world of difference(#3)I have exercise induced asthma. I found out when I was young. I was able to participate in Gym class due to my asthma. It sucked big time, still sucks. Especially now that I‚Äôm overweight and need to lose at least 40 pounds. Sometimes walking by itself is too much and can trigger my asthma. Definitely frustrating.(#4)I had flu, mom noticed I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I managed to stay conscious until we go to the hospital and bed. Last thing I remember is people talking around me in a panic.

Then I woke up in a another hospital room with my mom beside me.

After I the nurses and doc made sure I was ok my lung capacity got tested before and after running oitside in the cold. Doctor to took one look at the test results and said ""It is clear. You have exercise induced asthma. Your lung capacity nosedives after running.""(#5)I found out because I would always be on the floor coughing for 30ish minutes after a CrossFit workout. I thought I was just working hard. The coach suggested I go to the doctor for the possibility and turns out I have exercise induced. But the cough is still my biggest thing. It just doesn‚Äôt stop."
What can I use to disinfect my nebuliser?,7,1.0,8,"(#1)Mine has instructions to disinfect every other day. Either by boiling for 5 minutes or soaking in diluted vinegar for an hour. 

And of course wash either soapy water before/after use, whichever you prefer.(#2)How often do you use it ?(#3)You shouldn‚Äôt really need to disinfect it if you‚Äôre the only one using it. 

What kind do you have? One with a long tube? 

I use gentle baby wipes daily. Honest brand. 

Otherwise you can use warm soapy water as needed.(#4)I boiled mine for 5-10 mins and let it dry(#5)You do not need to clean the airline (long clear tube). Maybe wipe it on the outside if you're feeling particular, but that's it.

The other items you can rinse under warm water and let air dry. If you use detergent, you'd have to be very careful getting it *all* off, otherwise you're nebulizing detergent into your lungs; better to not risk it. (Using a small amount of soap on the mouthpiece only should be ok.) If you feel the need to sterilize, most mouthpiece/medicine cup assemblies can be boiled for a short time.

Don't use the dishwasher no matter how tempting it is. Lots of soap and other grossness in there that your stomach can tolerate but your lungs cannot."
Did Exercise cause my asthma?,1,0.67,5,"(#1)As far as I'm aware, exercise cannot induce the condition as a whole, but can definitely trigger an attack. I can't say in your particular case whether or not that definitively was the trigger as there can be many environmental factors (dust, allergens, perfumes/aerosols, etc), but if it happens frequently, check in with a doctor so you can get a treatment plan in place(#2)No, exercise did not cause your asthma. You already had asthma. It's not something that goes away.(#3)No exercise doesn't cause asthma."
Do I have asthma? Or excise induces asthma?,0,0.5,3,"(#1)Sounds like exercise induced asthma...do you have any chest tightening? Coughing and or wheezing? Usually you could also have additional symptoms...(#2)Yep sounds like it. Interestingly enough, you can have normal lung function during tests but still have symptomatic asthma. That happened to my entire family and they were confused until the doctor explained that it‚Äôs possible.(#3)You may be out of shape especially if you haven't done any exercise for the last 2 years."
Waking up from sleep with asthma attack?,24,0.97,22,"(#1)That was happening to me before I got on my maintenance inhaler back in November. I'd suggest talking to your primary care physician to get you the right meds. Best of luck!(#2)I have same issue(#3)Cold mist humidifier helps from dryness and coughs. Also one home remedy which helps alot. Warm some honey in cup and take a tablespoon full of honey, sprinkle with some crushed black pepper. Take this before going to bed and sleep like a baby. Best natural thing beside any concreted meds. 

Hope this helps(#4)Definitely need to discuss it with your doctor. I've had this problem for a long time. Thing that has helped most is not sleeping flat. I have a wedge that goes under the mattress but you can use a rolled up duvet or pillows under it. Also make sure your room is clean and get an air purifier with a HEPA filter.(#5)Just some tips. Make sure your room is clean. Wash your sheets regularly. Shower at night (not to hot). Don't eat at least 3 hours before bed. Check your toothpaste brand as some of the major brands have something in it that triggers asthma.(#6)This was happening to me and it turned out to be sleep apnea. 

You should tell your doctor about this.(#7)I had to get on a corticosteroid inhaler to control my asthma when this started happening. I wasn't changing my sheets or vacuuming enough, and my cat is shedding a lot more as she ages. Kept waking up coughing. I love my maintenance inhaler.(#8)Maintenance inhaler(#9)I'm having issues with this too.(#10)See your doctor. Waking up at night with your asthma (especially if it's happening often) might mean you need stronger preventer meds.(#11)I have this too.(#12)Same it‚Äôs horrible I can get up even 2-3-4 times a night just to cough like a watery phlegm. I also take my puffs. My question is do you smoke? Or it happens to you as a non-smoker? The second question is how many puffs from the inhaler you take in a day? I want to compare my case with yours(#13)I had this a few nights a week until I started a corticosteroid inhaler and never happened again(#14)Clean the room to remove as much dust as possible especially under the bed. And maybe looking into getting a special blanket and pillow(#15)Singulair stopped that happening for me(#16)Check your pillow for any allergens.(#17)Sleeping with my head under the covers helps me. Seems like an attack can get triggered from my  head being significantly colder than my core. Maybe it could help you too.(#18)I cannot stress this enough if you have any take  your preventive medicine, take your allergy medicine, and talk to your doctor you may need a different medicine or a stronger dose."

Asthma and secondhand pot smoke,5,0.78,12,"(#1)Yeah. I take the bus every day. I encounter at least one person who smells heavily of weed, and there used to be a girl at my bus stop who lit up every day. I gasp for air after about two minutes, and have to take my emergency inhaler. For this reason, taking the bus makes me hate life. I should note, however, that pollutants in the air (cigarette smoke or even smell, weed smoke or even smell, air fresheners, aerosols, bus/truck exhaust, etc) are my #1 and most aggressive trigger, so its not the same for everyone.(#2)I have asthma and smoke weed so it probably just varies from person to person.(#3)LMAO HE JUST LIT UP ? the audacity lmao(#4)Depending on your type of asthma, any irritant can bring on an attack. From smoke to dust to perfumes to pollution.

1960‚Äôs LA photochemical smog damn near killed me.(#5)I have mild asthma and yes it can. It's not different than cigs, Etc.(#6)Smoke of any kind is a trigger for my asthma. My husband smokes weed and brings his pipe back inside on cold days. I'm constantly having to drop a cover/lid onto the pipe because it still smolders sometimes inside and makes my breathing go sideways.

People smoking in public areas sucks, but at least if it's outside I can mostly avoid it. On public transport? I'd like to say I would make a comment or yell, but more likely I'd be just trying to get off at the next stop without passing out while trying to breathe.(#7)This guy feels very cool while messing with his own and the health of yours. While I think its ok if he does it in his private space, messing with the health of others is just an asshole behaviour. The smoke of tabbacco and weed is very bad for your lungs, try to avoid it by going away as far as possible."
Tongue swelling with Thrush,2,1.0,7,"(#1)Thrush doesn't cause swelling or difficulty swallowing.

It sounds like you are having an allergic reaction to something.(#2)Yeah, talk to your doctor about this. As someone else said, this could be an allergic reaction.(#3)Are you using a new mouthwash? I had issues with thrush with my inhaler too but I stopped using mouthwash altogether and I haven't had it since.(#4)I use plain water, rinse mouth and gargle. Repeat. Never had an issue with Thrush."
Asthma attack or anxiety?,2,1.0,5,"(#1)This is an anxiety attack especially if salbutamol doesn't improve it.(#2)anxiety can definitely make asthma symptoms more noticeable but once you are calm and the symptoms go away its usually anxiety .(#3)I can totally relate. There are several things that cause my asthma but when I get stressed I can‚Äôt control it. I had a really bad attack a few days ago because I‚Äôm going through a bad time. The only way for me to feel better is to go to bed and sleep upright while controlling my breathing. I‚Äôm thinking about learning meditation to help me deal with stress etc.(#4)When I'm not sure which it us I do a puff of my rescue. If that helps, it was asthma. If not probably my anxiety and then I go take my anxiety meds.(#5)Once, I got to the ER, because I had difficulty breathing and even salbutamol didn't help me. 

The doctor, after doing the tests, randomly said ""A lot of you teens have psychosomatic ilnesses novadays"". 

Although I felt breathless, my blood oxygen levels were very high, and I got respiratory alkalosis...The doctor said that by seeing my blood test results he would think that I'm on some hard drugs. 

So it was just anxiety and hyperventilation. 
Well, I had a mild infection too...but as soon as I got to the ER my breathing imroved...so I think it was pure anxiety."
"Son's friend has asthma,",13,1.0,37,"(#1)Nothing OTC will help his asthma. 

I would be having a conversation with his parents in the nicest way possible about making sure he has his inhaler. 

I also wouldn't allow him to come over without his inhaler if he's prone to attacks.(#2)He can also get an inhaler holder from Etsy or allergy apparel. To keep his inhalers on him.(#3)Primatene works really well for me personally, better than albuterol, but it depends on the person. Maybe his parents can see if he get get some extra inhalers so he can keep one in his bag and one at home.(#4)I'd be very cautious about giving him any over the counter medication in case he has some sort of reaction to it. Like others have said, an actual prescription albuterol inhaler is really the safest thing for him to have at all times for an attack. 

That being said, personally I've always found hot tea with honey and lemon juice in it to be very helpful.(#5)Yeah coffee /tea, slow breathing/calming down. I feel like not freaking out is the big one, as you can increase your oxygen concentration just by lowering your heartbeat a bit

Edit: also using allergy medicine works wonders for me as I have allergic asthma(#6)If he can't speak in full sentences without losing his breath or walk 10 yards or so without losing his breath,  it's 911 time.  Never wait!  Better to be extra safe with a kid.(#7)Do NOT give him OTC meds. His parents need to get him to smarten up about not losing his inhaler. I'm going to bet he never loses his phone.(#8)There‚Äôs nothing OTC, unfortunately. 

I will say good call on the coffee. I remember when I was young, like 5-10 years old, I‚Äôd be given coffee if I didn‚Äôt have an inhaler or something. Another thing to try and do is to calm him down. Having a breathing issue and not having the meds to fix it is incredibly anxiety inducing, which only makes it worse. Even now that I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs, if I start having problems and I don‚Äôt have my inhaler my anxiety skyrockets. I‚Äôve learned to deal with it but I‚Äôd doubt a 13 year old has.(#9)Magnesium, in high doses. Topically mixed with DMSO will relieve an asthma attack as well.(#10)Okay I have serious asthma since I was 3 years old and have had many experiences with severe asthma attacks at friends houses as a kid. I think the kid needs to be a little more responsible for his asthma and not forget his inhaler but if the situation happens again the best option would be to drive him home so he can use his nebulizer. There are other tricks one can use to stop a severe attack and make it more mild and these are 

hot liquid helps. Tea with honey is best option because honey is an anti inflammatory but coffee works too.

Sit in a bathroom and run the shower as hot as possible to breathe in the steam.

Primateme mist isn't nearly as good as Albuterol but it's relatively harmless especially in a one off usage for an emergency attack. The problem is that the inhaler is pretty weak and ineffective but in the event of a serious attack I would much prefer that option than the hot liquid or steam option and it's not even close. 

If none of those options work or for some reason are unavailable then your next best option is to take the kid to an urgent care clinic. Trust me I am 45 years old and still are prone to severe life threatening attacks and I always go to the urgent clinic and come out much much better within like an hour. They have very competent respiratory doctors who will give him a nebulizer treatment and possibly corticosteroids if needed.

The emergency room is the last option i would use. If someone is having a severe allergic reaction or if they are laboring so hard to breathe that they can't really talk or say full sentences or if it's a real struggle just to walk and exert energy then this is the time to rush to hospital. 

I feel like already you are going above and beyond what a friends parent can do, but if you really wanted to be safe you can always purchase an Albuterol inhaler on the internet. The good ol great USA is about the only country that you need a prescription to buy Albuterol inhaler but you any pharmacy in England or India or Mexico will mail you an inhaler that cost about $27 and is perfectly legal. I've done it multiple times when I get fed up with always having to see a doctor just for a goddamn inhaler but I digress. 

Hope any of this helps(#11)Not medical or legal advice:

I wouldn't plan on giving someone else's kid medication they are not prescribed. 

I'd ask the parents if they can pick up a spare inhaler for him. Usually you can fill, say, one a month or something- but no one should be going through NEARLY that many inhalers, so they'll have spares. If money is a concern, you could just offer to buy one ($45 or less cash) to keep in your house.(#12)I personally am asthmatic and i have one inhaler at home and one always in my bag.
I would try to find a way to have an inhaler that works for home at your place.

I was u diagnosed for about 10 years and now just knowing i always have one near me, helps me knowing nothing can happen.
Even if it (seems) mild, you never know if it is actually.mild(#13)NO on the primatene. For some people it makes the attack worse and that's the last thing you want.  Honestly if he's at your house often I would talk to his parents about getting and extra inhaler to keep there. Generic Albuterol inhalers are as cheap as $10  with insurance and I think they are $30 without so it's not going to put them out much.(#14)Bruh as a kid I had 4 or 5. As a teen one was always in my pocket. 

But basically kiddo needs one on him, in his backpack, at school, at home, and the places he most often like grandmas or church or the best friend across town with the key people knowing what to do when. 

This is bad preparation.(#15)Caffeine. Taking a shower can definitely help especially if allergies is a trigger."
Mild Asthma diagnosis,2,1.0,3,(#1)Have you ever been evaluated for GERD/silent reflux/LPR? These can mimic asthma especially with night time symptoms.
Cough variant Asthma?,5,1.0,15,"(#1)Cold Mist Humidifier helps a lot for dry coughs. US weather swings is making crazy for everyone but i have cold mist humidifier next to my bed and it helps in night sleeps especially when i lay on bed and throat irritation causes coughs(#2)We‚Äôre you recently sick with an upper respiratory infection or cold? 

Sounds like dry air irritation. 

Try sipping some warm water with honey in it. I‚Äôve also had luck with chocolates but don‚Äôt choke or fall asleep with it in your mouth.(#3)My asthma presents as a cough also. I am going to have the methacholine challenge test also as my pulmonary function test was ""normal"".(#4)I have the same thing. Whenever I play hockey, or do some form of workout in the cold it irritates my asthma and I feel like I have a tickle and dry cough. It goes away after time though. Sometimes I‚Äôll suck on a peppermint lozenge and it goes away"
Singular psychiatric side effects,10,0.92,26,"(#1)It's usually an uncommon side effect that only happens to a select few. No issues for me. Try it and see how you respond.(#2)My diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) came years after being on Singulair, so my doctor says Singulair did not cause it. Besides, I‚Äôm pretty sure I had GAD long before I started Singulair, but just got the diagnosis after.

Edit: have they tried any daily inhalers for you yet? That‚Äôs usually the first thing to try before Singulair.(#3)I asked someone I was close to and saw often to help me keep an eye out for any personally changes/irritability/etc when I started singulair. Psychiatric side effects are rare, but doing this helped me feel better about starting the med, and I imagine that if I‚Äôd actually had a response, would‚Äôve helped me catch it quickly. There‚Äôs no way to know if it‚Äôs gonna effect you without taking it, though.(#4)Everyone is different. If you look up montelukast on the FDA's website, they'll tell you they only blackboxed it out of extreme precaution, and that their own meta study found no significant psychological impacts to users. 

Just try it, and if it causes problems, just stop it.(#5)I have anxiety and had no issues with it. Actually have less anxiety because asthma attacks give me anxiety! I was worried too.(#6)I was on it for a long time.  After my PTSD inducing event I can no longer take it.(#7)I had bad side effects after being on singular for a few weeks but I still take it for a few days (no more than 5 in a row) when I‚Äôm having flare ups. I‚Äôd say self-monitor closely to see if you have any bad side effects and alert other people around you if you have people you can trust with that. It worked well for me but it definitely wasn‚Äôt worth it to take long term.(#8)I had severe preexisting anxiety prior to taking singulair but I found being on the medication made it worse, to the point I had to go off it. It was prescribed for my allergies so we just decided to do allergy shots instead. Either way, the singulair certainly didn‚Äôt cause my anxiety but it was an antagonist for sure. Just my experience.(#9)I have been fine on it despite having generalized anxiety disorder and depression. I think you can only start it and see if you are one of the ones who are fine or one of the very small number that can‚Äôt tolerate it. It took me 2 weeks for it to feel normal I had the odd mild headache at first and had to find the best time to take it (9pm for me). Good luck- it‚Äôs a wonder drug for some like me.(#10)I have PTSD (of the C-PTSD variety) along with the accompanying anxiety and depression, and Singulair has not affected anything whatsoever. In fact, it may have actually reduced my anxiety a little by not having to worry about my lungs closing up at the slightest hint of fragrance.(#11)We don't understand a lot scientifically about singular's psychiatric side effects, including whether or the sides effects are worse in people with PTSD. The best way to find out how it affects you would be to take it for a few weeks and monitor closely for an increase in mental health issues.(#12)Hi I have anxiety and panic attacks before my asthma got worse. I was taking Sertraline 100 mg for my anxiety and it works really to me up till now. After having contracted with Covid, my asthma got worse , and my Dr. Put me on Singular as well although she already acknowledged my current anxiety med. i would say first day, I was shaky and edgy. And been taking it for nearly 10 days. I can tell that my anxiety get worse even I am tAking sertraline 100mg together with it. I get more startled which is I am before taking sertraline. So, this is my experience. I might have to ask my Dr. For stop taking Singular or if I can take any alternative.(#13)I have PTSD. I trialled Singulair/Montelukast for almost a month. My GP obviously knew about my previous mental health issues and the fact that I was not taking any medication for it at the time and was happy to prescribe it. 

During those 3.5 weeks I didn't experience any worsening of my mental health. Maybe I would have if I'd taken it for longer, who knows? 

What I did experience though, and unexpectedly I might add, was hypotension. The low BP left me feeling very tired. 

It also didn't work as intended, there was no discernible improvement, my asthma symptoms remained the same, uncontrolled. My GP then told me it didn't work for everyone and if it was going to work I would've seen some improvement by 3.5 weeks. I now use Tiotropium instead.(#14)How long do you have to take singular daily to feels the effects in your life. During teen years i use to take but quit because of the hassle of taking it daily. My rescue inhaler was ready but was on as need basis (one or twice a month for few days). 

Even after 20 years i still have my rescue inhaler and didnt out grow of asthma the way usually doctors says(#15)[deleted](#16)This probably isn't helpful, but I honestly think it's a judgement call. My pulmonologist wanted to put me on it but as one doc said, I'm ""sensitive to medicine."" I seem to get a side effect from anything. I had a hard time finding an antihistamine that wouldn't give me nightmares. Birth control put me into a deep depression. I personally wasn't going to risk it with this drug. I got a second opinion with an allergist and she started me on Spiriva (in addition to the Symbicort I was already taking). And it really helped. But like others said, Singular hasn't affected then. I think you need to weigh the pros and cons and have a plan if you do decide to take it (do you live with someone who can tell a behavior difference? Do you have a regular doctor you can talk to if something does affect your mood or behavior? Etc)(#17)My daughter tried it briefly after two ICU admissions. She lasted 4 weeks and was borderline psychotic. She is 15 with many other social/academic/physical stressors at this time so I am not certain it was the Singulair. The Singulair really did help with the asthma symptoms. She is now well controlled with Symbicort and Dupixent. It‚Äôs worth a try.(#18)It‚Äôs really rare to have neuropsychiatric effects, but it‚Äôs also a very night and day sort of effect ‚Äì meaning that whether or not you had a prior mental health issue, you will notice a change. It‚Äôs a hell of an effective medication but if you‚Äôre one the unlucky few it can mess you up badly. I was on it for 5 years (2014-2019 tapered to 5mg, fully off mid 2020). Suffered severe depression, cognitive decline, memory issues, brain fog and aggression‚Ä¶ was not a good Time. I had existing mental health issues but it caused really drastic symptoms from what I previously had. 

As with any drug, beware of the risks and be monitored closely just in case.(#19)I have (well managed) depression and GAD. No real changes with the singulair as far as I can tell. 

Not medical advice, but I'd personally discuss those concerns with your prescribing doctor, and also let all your mental healthcare providers know you're starting it and have concerns. And, of course, if you do notice changes, let your doctor know ASAP.(#20)I started taking it 2 weeks ago. I have GAD and have had bouts of depression before. 
The tablets have made me very sensitive. I usually only cry when depressed (diagnosed clinically) but I have cried multiple times over the last few weeks. 

Honestly though, I haven't slept better in years, I think being a bit teary is probably worth the sleep.(#21)Also diagnosed with uncontrolled asthma as well and put on singulair. with me at the beginning i had a lot of crying episodes and man ‚Ä¶ hospital visits for mental illness just to find out ‚Äú you are depressed ‚Äú but in the long run singulair did help my asthma get better(#22)It helped my asthma tremendously but I absolutely could not handle the impact this medication had on my mental health. I cried every single day, had suicidal ideation, and started displaying bipolar-like symptoms and I told my doctor so she told me to stop taking it and see a therapist. After a month of being off the medication, my mood returned to normal and I stopped seeing a therapist. I‚Äôve been feeling like myself ever since then. But this obviously isn‚Äôt the same for everyone. Definitely monitor any mood changes closely"
I find that the HFA inhaler (like Flovent) (mist) always gives me thrush symptoms. I rinse of course. Will this go away eventually. the powders don't seem to give me this but I want to switch up preventers.,3,1.0,3,"(#1)Always did me as well. I switched to Qvar redihaler and it works well for me.(#2)Do they not have a powder version of Flovent?  Check.(#3)If you haven‚Äôt already, you can try using a spacer with your inhaler. This will help catch some of the particles that get stuck on your tongue & in your throat. It will also help your dose get deeper into your lungs, which also helps reduce thrush as well as getting you a more effective dose because more of the medication gets deeper into your lungs. You can also try taking probiotics and brushing your teeth/eating/drinking after taking your dose and rinsing your mouth out if you aren‚Äôt already."
Homeopathy,0,0.38,17,"(#1)Herbal remedies can provide good relief from asthma symptoms, in my experience, though not in any emergency context. Mullein is my go-to, personally.

Homeopathy is not something I'd personally entrust my health to at all - it isn't verified beyond being a placebo, as far as I know.(#2)Nope. Nope. NO. 
Please don‚Äôt risk your ability to breathe. There is ZERO evidence that homeopathy works.(#3)No. Homeopathy has never cured anyone of anything. There is zero science behind that.(#4)If homeopathic medications worked they would just be called medicine. Don‚Äôt get tricked by the cultists(#5)Homeopathic and holistic treatments can definitely help your whole health *when used in conjunction with medical treatments*. The point of using holistic treatments is to take a whole body and               
mind approach, which includes taking your prescribed meds. Obviously if you‚Äôre eating healthier/ feeling happier and calmer/ drinking herbal tea instead of coffee you will feel better because caffeine and cortisol, for example, wont be exacerbating your symptoms. Homeopathy CANNOT REPLACE medicine especially with diagnosed breathing problems but it can help to *reduce negative triggers* and therefore OVERALL help. Again i must stress this is only in *conjunction* with medicine. Stopping meds WILL harm you, regardless of how much homeopathy reduces your symptoms.(#6)diet can take away symptoms but not cure it . holistic stuff is not a cure . soon as you stop your symptoms will come right back(#7)Nothing can cure asthma. It's a lifelong disease that can do in remission for periods of time but it's never gone.(#8)my parents are forcing me to drink 5 drops of some weird homepathic liquid with half a glass of water for 4 months and it literally has no effect.(#9)Don‚Äôt waste your time or money(#10)If someone says they can ‚Äòcure asthma‚Äô then they‚Äôre a liar and conman. It‚Äôs that simple. Besides, homeopathy is a scam anyway.(#11)There are natural supplements that can support the whole respiratory system. Lobelia is helpful during an asthma attack but you have to be careful with how much you take because it can make you sick. Bromelain and quercetin is also know to help support the lung and immune system. For me it has taken some trial and error to find out what helps me the best. In researching this stuff, it's helpful to know what triggers your asthma. My asthma is mostly triggered be allergies So I take stuff with Bromelain, quercetin, nettle, mullein and butterbur in it. I also take daily vitamins and  keep lobelia tincture around in case I need a boost. Diet and exercise can help asthma as well. But I'm not a professional so if you're serious about finding more natural ways to treat your asthma, I would seek out a holistic doctor.

Edited to add: I also take Claritin to help with managing allergies and I take CBD oil.(#12)There is no cure. Homeopathy is just a scam full of promises designed to separate you from your money.(#13)There is no cure for asthma. None. There are treatments that can help mitigate or prevent symptoms, even to the point of not requiring a maintenance inhaler, but you will not be cured.

Go ahead and drink extra water, being hydrated is always good. There was even a point in history where homeopathy was the more effective medical treatment, but that was because medicine at the time involved using arsenic, mercury, lead......and doing nothing but hydrating was indeed better then drinking arsenic or blood letting. But don't shell out money for homeopathic remedies, just drink water instead, it has the same effect.

Dietary changes, lifestyle changes, even learning meditative breathing can all help with asthma.(#14)I love homeopathy it works well for me. Go see a naturopath or homeopath and keep an.open mind.(#15)Load of old tosh homeopathic medicine"
How to trigger asthma on purpose?,0,0.11,13,"(#1)Nobody here is gonna help you with that.(#2)Don't do that.(#3)There is zero reason to do this on your own. Occasionally a doctor will do something similar in their office, but doing it yourself has no benefit. You‚Äôre not running tests or monitoring symptoms for a diagnosis, and you don‚Äôt have the resources on hand to quickly and effectively stop the attack if you need to(#4)If you don‚Äôt know how to trigger your asthma you probably don‚Äôt know what to do if your asthma gets triggered. How do you not know this? Do you actually have asthma? Or is it just super mild?(#5)100% don‚Äôt.

Does anyone else get triggered by foil food packaging?,1,0.67,2,"(#1)Does regular aluminum foil in your kitchen bother you?(#2)Hey I want to jump in here. I did research on something similar and discovered that mint is a common asthma trigger. Maybe you don‚Äôt eat as many junior mints? Just something to consider because it took me a while to figure this out since most of the reactions were mild. 

I had an issue with a few mint things. The worst was an oral medicine (and this is how I finally put it together that it was mint), but I had had some mild ones to a non Girl Scout thin mint, and then a mild sometimes but not always (?) to a mint toothpaste. Like every few nights, I seemed to have a bit of mild asthma after brushing my teeth. Only at night, only sometimes, and I didn‚Äôt need to use my inhaler.

It just seems suspicious that some of these are mint related. I don‚Äôt have the source anymore but it was in a few academic articles if you wanted to look into it."
Shortness of breath,0,0.5,5,"(#1)Lots of coffee dude, caffeine is a bronchodilator(#2)There is nothing I know aside from inhalers and medical help, and I‚Äôd be very cautious of trusting anything else.

The only other thing I can say is that try to stay calm, because stress can exacerbate asthma like crazy.

I'm getting a new primary care doctor and wrote myself a note on topics to cover. The preview is... a mood.,11,0.82,3,"(#1)Woof.  I feel that.(#2)yep lol since last year . ive had bad asthma until 20 years old . last year it came back(#3)Yeah I‚Äôve had asthma my whole life too, and I live in one of the worst air quality places in America. Hate this place"
Can stopping the brown preventer inhaler bring on chest pain/SOB/tightness?,8,0.91,14,"(#1)I'd recommend you get an asthma review asap, either with q practice nurse who knows about asthma or your GP. You may be right re: going back on the brown (Clenil Modulite, I assume, beclometasone is the ICS for anyone who's interested). Or you may need a different inhaler entirely!(#2)I'm not familiar with that preventer inhaler personally (I think it might be Flovent?), but I have been on both Advair and Pulmicort and have been told that your body can basically go through withdrawal and symptoms can get worse if you stop suddenly. Tapering off rather than stopping all at once may prevent that from happening. But I have also heard of asthma developing or getting worse post COVID. It could be a fun combination of both.

I'd definitely discuss this with a doctor if possible!(#3)The brown one I'm imagining is clenil modulite or the generic (beclometasone as active ingredient). In the UK Flovent is known as Flixotide, I don't recall seeing Flovent when I worked in pharmacy but am willing to be wrong, either way that one has fluticasone as the active ingredient. Regardless of which you have these are both steroid inhalers and so will cause side effects if stopped abruptly, they usually have a warning on the box saying do not stop taking unless advised by your GP. Even then they should wean you off it.

If you feel your brown one is not helping as much ask your GP for a referral to an asthma nurse, they can put you temporarily on a stronger steroid inhaler while your long covid symptoms persist so you're not reliant on your reliever. When you feel like your breathing is easier/better you can speak with them about stepping back down. Remember when you are breathing better that means your medication is working. Stopping your medication can cause symptoms to flare up again. Really though you'd need to speak to an asthma nurse about a management plan though if you wanted to go down the route of reducing your inhalers.(#4)If it's anything like what I take yes it can make a difference not taking it after one or 2 days.(#5)So you were prescribed a brown preventer inhaler (Beclemetasone I‚Äôm assuming) but you stopped taking it? 

You really need to keep taking your brown inhaler everyday, regardless of how you feel. The whole point of a preventative inhaler is that it helps to keep your airways open for longer and should keep your asthma under control. The blue inhaler (Ventolin) helps out if you suddenly feel short of breath or tightness (perhaps due to an irritant like smoke, pets or the cold). Some people need it before they exercise. You shouldn‚Äôt need to take the blue one too often. 

It‚Äôs a good idea to book an appointment in with your GP to check your asthma is ok. You should also have an asthma review every 3 months. Your asthma nurse will give you more detailed advice about your inhalers and the best techniques, to make sure you‚Äôre doing things correctly. 

Try also checking out asthma UK - they‚Äôre on Facebook and you can message them on WhatsApp for advice also.(#6)Stopping a preventer means you're stopping the thing that's preventing you from having asthma attacks. So yes, stopping the preventer can cause you to have asthma attacks. Get back on the brown inhaler because your asthma is bad enough that you need it."

Any tips for managing aggravating cold weather symptoms?,2,1.0,5,"(#1)Are you covering your mouth and nose with a scarf? Given that cold air can set asthma off, that could help. 

Also, ‚Äúhow‚Äù are you out of breath? Are you having constricted airways that you would use your inhaler for if they got worse, or are you generally out of breath like when exercising (I hope this makes sense, not sure how else to put it).(#2)Have you guys tried using Cold Mist humidifier in nights? Possibly it may soothe your throat and make it less itchy during daytime due to cold(#3)Yeah I‚Äôm using the same stuff, albuterol and Flovent, and I still have big time issues with the cold. Itchy, hoarse throat, chest pain and tightness, shortness of breath, dizziness, wheezing even. The only thing that helps me is albuterol but it doesn‚Äôt even get rid of the throat issues and only helps till the next time I have to move buildings for college classes. Just kinda what happens, ig. Sorry I can‚Äôt be of much help, just wanted to let you know I‚Äôm going through the same thing. I‚Äôll prob ask to go on another medication when I‚Äôm back in my hometown but for now my only hope is the albuterol.(#4)It can happen I believe my asthma came back after contracting covid"
I‚Äôm a terrible asthmatic,6,0.88,3,(#1)How did you manage it?  I mean I‚Äôm glad you did but if that would have been me I might have ended up in the hospital. I‚Äôm glad you found someone to help you but definitely a cautionary tale.
How much is too much albuterol?,12,0.94,20,"(#1)Yes, needing it every day or more than two or three times in a single day is too much. You need to talk to your doctor who treats your asthma to get on a daily controller medication or routine that works for you. 

Yes you can actually overdose on albuterol, there are a list of symptoms of overdose including dry mouth, tremors, chest pain, fast heart rate, nausea, seizures, light headedness/fainting, or just not feeling well. If you‚Äôre feeling any of these call the emergency number and get immediate medical treatment. The actual overdose amount is a lot, but stop taking so much albuterol at one time. It‚Äôs NOT safe. 

The best method is spacing doses out, but taking that much is not going to be truly effective or telling you if each dose worked if you took each puff one right after the other or within a few minutes of each other. I‚Äôve always taken one or two puffs and then waited to see if that plus breathing exercises calmed down an attack. I‚Äôve had some bad attacks, some lasting hours, I‚Äôve never had to take 6-8 doses to calm it down. 

Going forward, always take your rescue inhaler with you when you‚Äôre out. Don‚Äôt take so many doses at once. If after a few puffs you‚Äôre still having so much trouble it‚Äôs concerning you, you should seek treatment at a doctors office, urgent care or ER. Taking so many doses so quickly is reckless, it sometimes doesn‚Äôt feel like ‚Äúreal‚Äù or ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù medication but all medicine can be overused and dangerous when overused. Please never do this again, it can have long term affects if you do this often. Again, go see your doctor for a daily control medication, tell them honestly about your albuterol usage so they can educate you throughly on why it‚Äôs not good for your body to use it that way.(#2)Guys, i found a inhaler comparison chart in my phone from my last visit with Pulmonologist
 
[inhalers comparison chart](https://imgur.com/a/rSVgShb)

Albuterol inhaler is effective for 4-6 hrs and recently i discovered that it can be used before exercise . So now i should start hitting the gym and shouldn‚Äôt have any excuse left(#3)My asthma specialist said 6-8 puffs in 24 hrs is too much; and if you‚Äôre not feeling better after 1-2 puffs in 24 hours ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs useless and you‚Äôre wasting the medication and your asthma isn‚Äôt controlled.(#4)I just recently got diagnosed with eosinophilic asthma after suffering uncontrolled asthma symptoms for literal months. I was finding myself using WAY more than the advised dose of albuterol. I am talking 6 puffs on a good day, upwards of 12 on a bad day.(#5)If you're having an episode, you can hit your inhaler every 2X every 4-6 hours. But longterm, it's not terribly good for you. I've been told the active ingredients leech potassium from your body and can contribute to chest pain. Which is not fun. Long-term control requires steroidal inhaler and should help.

A good trick I've been using if my inhaler isn't doing the trick - Lay on a rubber ball (like massage ball or something hard and round) and place it near your shoulder blade muscle. It alleviates pressure on the lung and feels wonderful. Highly recommend.(#6)my pulmonologist told me that the more u use ur inhaler, the less effective it becomes(#7)My allergist told me when I‚Äôm working out, if I feel I need it, to take Ventolin 10-15 minutes before the exercise. I usually take 1 puff before cardio. Your specialist may also recommend this, but like others have said, 6-8 at a time is far too much!(#8)Lots of good input here. It maybe worth distinguishing between a regular state and an asthma exacerbation. What I have been told is that if you need rescue inhaler every day, multiple times a day your asthma is uncontrolled and need maintenance inhaler or to up dose or something else beyond the rescue . If you are having an episode it‚Äôs hard to overdose but too much will give you those unpleasant side effects. During an asthma attack I have heard that you can take 2 puffs, wait 10 minutes- if still tight repeat and even a third time if you must. But once you feel good you should be ok for 2-4 hours and if you are not then it‚Äôs time to consider medical attention. Best: nebulizer second best: spacer third best: take inhaler and hold breath for 8 seconds each puff. I know there has been a lot of chat about montelukast on this sub but for me it was the only thing that broke my cycle of exacerbations. Has been one year and I feel a millions times better(#9)Waaat? Thoose numbers seem way too high for me. My doctor said if I need to use my rescue inhaler more than 3 times a WEEK (the one dose before workouts doesn‚Äôt count) , I need to schedule an appointment. Even when I‚Äôm sick I‚Äôm not supposed to take more albuterol, I have to take an extra dose of my combination preventive inhaler.(#10)6-8 puffs at once? Or that's the count for the day? 

Both ways it's too much. Especially the first option - 6-8 puffs at once - is a very bad decision. Didn't your healthcare provider tell you how to use your inhaler and the side effects of using it? 

Albuterol is not reccomended for daily use - it is only an emergency recpie. And in high doses (even in normal, actually) it can cause arrhytmia, elevated blood pressure and other health problems."
Spontaneous short lasting SpO2 drops.,6,1.0,4,"(#1)I once was so concerned about my oxygen levels that I went to the er. The dr told me that anything 90 or up was considered normal range.(#2)It's likely based on the way they read and calculate it. They inherently have a 2-5% error rate anyway. 

But if your symptomatic, talk to your doctor.(#3)Low 90‚Äôs is still acceptable and shouldn‚Äôt be a cause for worries. If it gets in the 80‚Äôs, then you should worry. 

A ‚Äúfun‚Äù thing you can do is put on the finger clamp and hold your breath for as long as you can. I can get mine to drop to 85. It shoots straight to 99-100 once I take a couple breaths then. It just shows how easily that number can change.(#4)Completely normal. Don't obsess over SpO2 drops."
Flovent toddler sleepiness,5,1.0,2,"(#1)Might want to take him to a doctor. When I went on Flovent I looked at all the side effects and fatigue isn‚Äôt a common one.

Do you blame your parents/relatives for smoking?,14,0.94,15,"(#1)yes,  my dad thought it was fun letting me have puffs when I was a toddler, and he was a chain smoker. 

 Now I have asthma(#2)Yes. When I went to the doctor the first time when I was about 13, the doctor stepped out of the room a second. My mom looked at me and said ""Don't tell them I smoke.""(#3)About my asthma - no, it runs in my family so it's more about genetics. About both being smokers that kept smoking inside after my diagnosis - yes. About that resulting in myself becoming a smoker at 15 - yes.(#4)Yes. My mom smoked when pregnant, chainsmoked in the house and car. When I got sick in my teenage years and the doc told her to smoke outside, she was angry at me each time she went outside to smoke. 

Asthma is not hereditary in my family.(#5)Yes. My mother smoked while she was pregnant with all of her children. Both of my parents smoked heavily in the house despite having 3 out of 4 children with severe asthma. My brother's asthma was so bad he lived in a special asthmatic treatment center. We all started smoking very young (14ish) and still have severe asthma. Luckily all of us quit but my brother smokes cigars. My parents still smoke in the house and my father has emphysema.  One of my sisters died of esophageal cancer (likely caused by smoking) that spread to her stomach. She smoked until the day she died. I know that they are addicted and I know they love their children. But I still blame them for putting us all through that.(#6)My mom told me to not tell them she smokes but the doctor heard her. So yeah(#7)My step father used to smoke cigars in the car with the windows rolled up. I developed asthma not long after he and my mother got together when I was a child.(#8)yes and no. asthma can be hereditary, which in my family it is.  my parents both smoked thru my childhood and would smoke in the car with me in it so i do remind them of that when my asthma is flared up(#9)Nah my parents started smoking when doctors were telling people it was good for you.(#10)My mom was a heavy smoker all through my childhood. She also never cleaned the house. I was pretty healthy as a child but developed asthma in my 30‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt know if I can blame her but nobody in my family has asthma.(#11)I got asthma in a non smoking household.(#12)my biological mom did a lot of unhealthy things while pregnant to avoid hunger cause she didnt have enough food to eat . plus her environment was very unhealthy, full of smoke pollution as well .(#13)Yes.(#14)Nobody should be smoking around you(#15)no my dad never smoked near me he smoked outside never smoked in the car stopped on a the road and smoked outside

Ik where I got my asthma from it‚Äôs from my moms side"
Exercise induced asthma,7,1.0,13,"(#1)I was told to use my salbutamol inhaler before I run or do exercise ,and it seems to help.(#2)The only thing that has helped me is getting on preventive medication. I still get a little chest tightening while lifting, but nowhere near as bad as it used to be! Can‚Äôt remember the last time I used my inhaler.(#3)I take a puff of my inhaler 20 mins before and about 5 mins before I exercise. It works for me. I‚Äôll be wheezing if I don‚Äôt take it.(#4)No. But I find that a slow warm-up helps a bit, particularly in cold weather. 

Keep at it, as I slowly go fitter it did ease up after a few years.(#5)Talk to your doctor about other medication options if you feel your asthma is not as controlled as you‚Äôd like. Hopefully they can give you some guidance. 

The Trelegy Ellipta completely got my exercise induced asthma under control, which I believe the umeclidinium component is to thank for. Had to switch off of it due to a medication interaction but otherwise it was the best daily control medication I‚Äôve been on. Only has to be taken once a day too! And GSK has a copay coupon card at the moment for Trelegy that makes its copay $0. An option to consider but ultimately something to talk to your provider about.(#6)Im desperate also to learn how can i get it under control. Its a embarrassment when i try to jog on treadmill and gasping for air. Never could take part of any sports due to asthma and now it moved to sports induced asthma but still not cleared out from it(#7)Its really up to what exactly gets your asthma triggered. If cold air and lots of heavy breathing during cardio like running does it, try going to a nice and clean indoor gym and do some weight training with heavier weight and less reps. You can get a nice workout and get strong without straining the lungs.(#8)Running/jogging outside really affects mine. Low impact like spinning (peloton), elliptical or weights seem to be better.(#9)Talk to your doctor about controller meds. If you are on the correct controller med, you may not need to use an inhaler while exercising.(#10)Take your preventative medicine. If you don‚Äôt have any talk to your doctors"
My doctor won't refill my rescue inhaler,27,0.84,44,"(#1)unfortunately, this is common. Even though the substitute med should be equivalent, it isn't always.  Suggestion- ask for a virtual visit, either telephone only or audio video.(#2)Do a teledoc apt.(#3)if you run our urgent care should give you something(#4)Goodrx or ask the pharmacy for how much with their discount card. 

Also ... I hate that doctors hold persciptions owner people heads.  Often they will fill perscription if you just schedule an appointment.  I know standard of care for me is 2X a year which is a total waste.  Once would be enough.

Never tried it... but Goodrx has a teleclinic too.(#5)If it's not covered, ask them to put it through GoodRx.(#6)I had to fight my health insurance company the last three weeks to get both my maintenance and emergency inhalers covered‚Ä¶ after they‚Äôve covered them for three years. I swear they want us to die. I empathize.(#7)Call the pharmacist and discuss, some will switch it without consulting the doctor. You can have it transferred to another pharmacy‚Ä¶ ask them if they can switch it before transferring tho(#8)Virtual visit?(#9)I hate doctors like that. Find a new PCP that doesn't hold you hostage.(#10)Asthma does need to be followed pretty closely. Try to get in when you can! 
Sorry about your dad(#11)This happens a lot. I have changed doctors twice because of it. Assholes.(#12)Yeah.  It's really dumb.  I really don't think asthma inhalers should require a prescription.  They can't be any more or less dangerous than countless other over the counter medicines.(#13)GoodRx does virtual visits. It not free but it's pretty cheap. If I remember right, I paid $10 for a month of GoodRx gold and got a free virtual visit that way. They'll electronically send the prescription to your pharmacy. 

The whole process from signing up for the service through to picking up my refill at the pharmacy took like 2 hours.(#14)Don't let your inhalers get down to the 11th hour before refills.

Pay attention to the number of refills left on the script as well.

Most physicians require at least one visit per year to maintain scripts.

30 minutes isn't that far for a doctors appointment. They also should have telehealth appointments available.

Even then if it's that much of a burden right now, pay cash for the other inhaler and run through Good Rx.(#15)Go into your local urgent care clinic and tell them that you need a checkup and RX for a rescue inhaler.(#16)Update: Thanks to everyone who offered encouragement and advice! My Doctor did refill my prescription after some going back and forth with them, and somehow they gave me 2. This is not the first time she has given me the run around  that cost me heartache and money. It's terrifying to think I could be without my rescue inhaler when I need it just because I can't come in for visit when I have other things going on that need taken care of.  I have been looking into a more local doctor as well as a new pulmonologist ( I don't care for either one and they are too far away for me to see on a regular basis). I will also take some of your advice and look at what kind of virtual appointments I can have.(#17)Welcome to the real world.

Imagine you're a doctor. You have to make payments on the malpractice insurance, mansion, summer house, both Mercedes, and 2 kids in Medical school ....... you have to keep the funds rolling in.

Its a symbiotic financial relationship between the Pharmaceutical industry and medical profession. You're caught in the middle. Holding you hostage is the term I believe.

The Pharmaceutical and Insurance industries are constantly making back room deals. I've had to switch medications several times, not because my doctor recommended it, but because they couldn't come a resolution that both parties found financially lucrative enough. 



Everyone hates the system ...... but loves their doctor.

In a perfect system they would keep refilling your prescription until either you decided you need to go see him, or something better is available and he calls you in to make your life better. 

It is what it is. I've been dealing with it for decades. Doctor cuts you off when he needs you to come in ...... listen to you breath for 10 seconds ...... and writes you another prescription.... bills your insurance company enough to make another Mercedes payment. You get what you need to live, and so does he.

You basically have to learn to navigate within your inconsequential position in this equation, be flexible  and plan far enough in advance that you never run out of what you need to survive.(#18)[deleted](#19)Why wouldn‚Äôt they authorize the refill?"
Struggling,2,1.0,5,"(#1)Congratulations, i know its tough and it will take time to get out of nicotine urges but you got it. I quit about 9 years ago when i heard about my 1st baby. I used to smoke 4-5 per day for 15yrs but Yes it was hard. 

So to kill my urge i chew gum or ate chocolates. It took some time but i got over it. Some time when urge is too high i make my fingers like im puffing a cigarette, take deep breaths just like smoking a big cigar and exhale out. Few of those fake puffs and my urge is gone. ( i dont do this in front of ppl cause they will think im crazy) but gladly im out of smoking. 

Honestly, your sense of smell will become stronger and sensitive that you can smell cigarettes smoke from far away which you have lost while smoking for so long. 

Hey buddy, you got this. Couple of months will be hard but you will be out.

Personal Crazy experience: i have asthma and still deal with it now. I started smoking in teens because i didnt had access to my rescue inhaler and it used to calm me down and get out of asthma episode. Told my doctor and they thought i was crazy but it worked for me. Had to quit so i dont damage my lungs in longer run, so if you quit that‚Äôs a  positive thing for your future(#2)All I can really offer is that your asthma will feel so much better. 
And there's systems of other health benefits. 

Good luck op!(#3)I fee you on this . i dont get scared asthma wise cause i dealt with bad asthma before so its like ‚Äú if my bad asthma comes back i know how to deal ‚Äú its more OTHER stuff i fear .  which actually made me choose smoking cause i figured i could handle it(#4)Everyone has tricks. My recommendation is mostly just to tough it out and get through it. Don't trade one reliance for another. You're doing the right thing and it will get easier. Play chicken with the withdrawals and win. 

If you have to do something, make sure it's healthy. Drink water. Exercise. Etc.(#5)I understand you‚Äôre worried and struggling, but this really isn‚Äôt the place to post about smoking or quitting smoking. There are lots of support groups or subreddits out there, I suggest you go there for advice about quitting."
Flovent HFA 110mcg,7,0.82,22,"(#1)Asthma that‚Äôs bad enough for 3-4 albuterol treatments a day is far higher of a death risk than a simple maintenance inhaler.

Treat your asthma with Flovent, rather than mask it with albuterol(#2)You won't have an allergic reaction to a steroid. Because well, they crush the allergic response.

And if you need nebs everyday because your wheezing, then your asthma warrants ICS. You'll probably feel a lot better.(#3)Florent is quite safe.  Both my daughter and I use it. Don't worry about it. I actually layer it with 2 other control inhalers daily.(#4)My child used this inhaler from age 8 to 12 before being switched. She had no issues(#5)I‚Äôm the same way with my anxiety and allergic reactions. I promise you will be fine, take a puff, do some deep breathing and try to relax. I know it is easier said than done, but this inhaler is great. I‚Äôm on it now, 2x a day. I would ask your doctor for a spacer though, thrush from these inhalers is a pain in the arse.(#6)Alrighty so here‚Äôs what I know. 
My treatment plan for my asthma is Flovent HFA 2x per day and then albuterol as needed up to four times a day. I‚Äôm doing well. Flovent hasn‚Äôt caused any issues for me. My mom claims she experienced thrush from when she went on Flovent but apparently that‚Äôs more common w the disk and not so much with HFA. It‚Äôs a steroid so it won‚Äôt kick in immediately, it is used for maintenance as opposed to being a rescue inhaler which is why they decided to give it to you since you clearly need maintenance. Long-term side effects are not guaranteed, thankfully. You‚Äôll most likely be fine. The only thing they warned me about with Flovent is that you need to gargle with water and spit it out after you use it to prevent the buildup of corticosteroids in the back of your throat, as that can cause some issues. Aside from that, if you‚Äôre anything like me, you will most likely find this to be the best course of action. Because for me, it got to the point that I needed albuterol a few times a day bc my symptoms would get unbearable, which they said most of that could be avoided if I scheduled Flovent and I would prob need albuterol much less. Good luck :)(#7)I used Flovent also to control my asthma but it caused me to lose my voice‚Ä¶. After stopping it a month later my voice came back, so odd. But it did help with my asthma a bit.(#8)are you having constant flare ups ? i was having mini flare ups in the summer then one bigger flare up last summer than was given flovant . it helped so much . and yes i had lots of anxiety before starting flovant too lol(#9)I should state you guys, I only need to do half a treatment at a time. Not a full one. Lol idk if that makes a difference ?!"
What does a mild asthma attack feel like to you?,3,1.0,5,"(#1)Being out of breath and having a mild asthma attack have some distinctions in my experience. The most characteristic one IMO is a sensation where I will inhale but my lungs don‚Äôt fill with air as quickly as normal. Almost feels like the resistance of breathing through a straw. Asthma attacks usually involve these additionally:

- Mild burning sensation in lungs
- Disproportionately tired for the level of exertion
- Higher sputum production
- Not feeling physical fatigue after recovering

Taking my rescue inhaler about 30 minutes before exercise has largely eliminated these symptoms though.(#2)I get very tired, fatigued, and irritable. Basically I‚Äôm slowly suffocating. 

I don‚Äôt wheeze which makes these mild attacks dangerous.

Wheezing does not always accompany asthma attacks. And wheezing doesn‚Äôt mean attack.(#3)basically like a regular asthma attack but the symptoms are much much less severe and you can basically can control it from getting to the point of hospitalization. however any irritation like smoking can trigger stuff like hyperventilating and can cause much severe symptoms . i learned from experience(#4)It kind I of sounds like you've been having excercise induced attacks for a long time. But just without the wheeze. The difference to me is not being able to get breath. Like someone is squeezing my chest. I'm rarely out of breath without at least a touch of wheezing but when I am I have no trouble breathing."

I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll die from asthma,15,0.86,19,"(#1)If your asthma isn‚Äôt severe and you‚Äôve never had an asthma attack, you aren‚Äôt going to die from it. You can stop worrying about that. 

That said, there is a link between anxiety and asthma attacks. So if you aren‚Äôt already, I would make sure that you are getting treatment for both.

I‚Äôm not super familiar with this because it doesn‚Äôt happen to me, but there are calming exercises that can help if you get an anxiety-triggered asthma attack. It would be good to look into that. https://asthma.net/natural-remedies/relaxation-techniques(#2)>How likely am I to die? Is it rare?

Extremely likely. I would say you have a 100% chance of dying from something. Maybe it will be asthma, but probably not soon, it sounds like your asthma is well controlled right now. However, it might be worth mentioning to your doctor that your anxiety is not well controlled, because there's medication that can help you with that too. :)

If you aren't sucking down that salbutamol like it's fresh air, though, and your asthma is so well controlled that you've never needed it, I suspect you'll be okay as long as you take the maintenance inhaler and keep it that way.

You will die, but you don't have to fear it the whole way. It happens to literally all of us at some point. Work on bringing your anxiety under control with the help of medical professionals next and live whatever life you have!(#3)If you go on to treat your asthma well and always take your salbutamol inhaler with you its extremely unlikely something could happen. Most deaths in asthma happen due to untreated asthma, wrong use of medication or severe asthma. Controlled asthma doesnt tend to be deadly, especially not when you always have you salbutamol inhaler with you. No need to worry!(#4)I get anxiety like that. Like, what if something major happens and I can‚Äôt get my Advair. After a day or so without it I‚Äôm in trouble.(#5)Anxiety is a bitch and can cause a whole lot of unnecessary problems, that can sometimes manifest themself physically. Try to get that under control first. From the sound of it your asthma is well controlled. If you take your salbutamol more than a couple times a week, you should talk to your dr about your asthma.

Something I‚Äôve done that has helped regulate my anxiety with asthma is to get a peak flow meter. It helps me understand if my asthma is worse or if it‚Äôs just anxiety.(#6)I've given myself far more severe asthma attacks than I ever suffered ""naturally,"" all because I couldn't find my inhaler and that set off an anxiety/panic attack.  Been to the ER at least 3-4 times because of it.

The linkage between your anxiety and your breathing, and your asthma, is very real!  

I will say, though, that actually suffering a severe health outcome like death or a long lasting heath consequence because of asthma is exceedingly rare if you're on good controller medicines and have a rescue inhaler. 

You're really not in any practical danger and there are probably a dozen more ""dangerous"" things that you do every day without thinking about it, like get in a car. 

So please don't worry about your asthma.  It sounds mild, you're on medication, you have a rescue inhaler.  Don't worry about it. 

And maybe talk to someone about your anxiety!  I don't say that to shame you or anything, but talking to someone can really help.  I'm in therapy once a week, I'm on an SSRI... it really helps. 

Take care.(#7)Of course it would be the best to always have your emergency spray with you and to avoid triggers (like extreme stress or too much physical activity), but even if you'd ever get an asthma attack it's not automatically a death sentence. 

I've had two serious asthma attacks, one in childhood when one of my allergies was triggered and the other one during some very stupid sports exercise in middle school. I don't remember the allergy attack since I was pretty young but my mother said I passed out and collapsed to the floor. There's usually enough time for help until you get into a serious condition. During the sports exercise, I had to run 1 round then 2 rounds up to 5 rounds around a square with very short breaks inbetween, after some time my body just couldn't handle it anymore and I felt how my lungs couldn't get a grip on air anymore. I read somewhere that you actually can't breath out during an asthma attack - it'll feel like you can't breath in, though. I didn't had my emergency spray with me and waited maybe 10 minutes outside on a chair with a bottle of juice my teacher gave me. Looking now at it, she probably reacted really inappropiate. My parents brought me my maintenance inhaler instead of my emergency spray which obviously didn't really help, I still somehow managed to get through with breathing techniques, the juice and trying to calm down. Idk if an ambulance would've been necessary to call or not since I calmed down enough to get back to normal but if you ever get into this situation, especially if you feel like it's serious, better be safe than sorry and get medical help asap. 

It came to that point a few times more often during sports or super stressful events, they were not as serious though and calming down/stopping the activity and/or using my emergency spray was enough to get back to normal.

So yeah, asthma attacks in movies often appear like some kind of heart attacks where you suddenly stop breathing and can't move anymore but they're, in my humble experience - there's probably people with other experiences, a conscious state in which you're usually able to get help or help yourself before you even get close to die from it. You could die from Asthma but Asthma is a rare death cause, with proper eduaction and care it's very preventable.(#8)you aint gonna die , if your anxiety doesnt even set off your asthma ‚Ä¶ lol you need therapy(#9)I think most people with severe asthma wonder about this as well.

And yes I believe there is a link between asthma and anxiety. 

In my case ...... I think I might have outgrown it somewhat. Like most health related anxieties ....... I can only worry about it so much before my mind gets tired of worrying about it ...... and i somehow move on with life and it eventually fades into the dustbin of history.

But still ....... I do think asthma, even though I have it mostly under control ...... will be a contributing factor in my eventual death.

I know that whenever I am sick with flu or whatever ...... I do make sure to maximize my asthma preventative measures. Because as bad as the flu sucks ...... flu and an asthma attack at the same time really sucks ....... I've survived that in the past, but not sure I could today.

In your case it sounds like the anxiety might be the bigger of your problems. Wish I had some good advice for you ...... my daughter has anxiety issues as well ...... but I dont. Breathing techniques and distractions would be my suggestions.(#10)It's pretty unlikely if your asthma is well controlled, which it sounds like it is! I'd try to see a therapist or something to try to reduce your anxiety levels, though.(#11)It's extremely rare. If you suffer from anxiety, seeing a therapist could be very helpful.(#12)I have been hospitalized with Asthma from the time I was 6 years old.  I am on a Biologic (Dupixent), Alubterol, Singulair, flovent, and 10mg of prednisone maybe 1x a week if I need it.  I am 54 years old and I have not been in the ER for Asthma in at least 10 years and I have a fairly active life. I go to the gym, I travel, etc.  I think you will be fine.(#13)Have you tried chamomile tea... anxiety can trigger asthma and asthma causes anxiety.. drinking chamomile tea helped me for a while...not sure why it does what it does but it works(#14)I dunno I‚Äôve had asthma for all 21 years of my life and I haven‚Äôt died from it yet. Hey at least your remembering to take your maintenance medicine that‚Äôs a major helper in not dying from asthma.(#15)I had a near-fatal asthma attack and it was so close I was was turning blue when EMS got to me. The same week two women in other countries died of asthma while waiting for help.

I don‚Äôt know about your asthma but if it‚Äôs bad or getting worse, don‚Äôt try to be reassured by statistics-see your doctor, please."
Testicular exam for an asthma diagnosis?,6,0.88,23,"(#1)Never heard of that. Sound like maybe doctor was doing a routine hernia exam, not asthma. They grab your balls and ask you to turn your head and cough.(#2)Reminds me of the family guy episode where peter was given a prostate exam lol(#3)Many young men present with trouble breathing that is testicular cancer that has spread to the lungs. But still, that is weird. The doctor should have explained the reasoning. 
I recently had a patient, 19 yo, super healthy athlete that had testicular Mets in his lungs. His prognosis is good but it will require tons of chemotherapy.(#4)Was it a general practitioner or a specialist?(#5)Strikes me as odd. People are very trusting of doctors. If something doesn't seem right, it's okay to ask why and if you are uncomfortable just leave. If you feel violated report it. However I have no idea if this is normal or not for asthma checking. Last time I checked asthma is in the lungs not the balls.(#6)I went in for chest pain once (known asthma) and they tried to give me a rectal exam. I declined. Only took an X-ray to figure out I had pneumonia and it wasn‚Äôt in my colon ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è(#7)No, that is not part of an asthma exam.(#8)There was no reason to do such an exam when your complaints and symptoms didn't indicate it. 

I would not return to this physician and I would even file a complaint with your states licensing.(#9)How old are you? Did they also do a physical to see if you‚Äôre growing properly, assuming you‚Äôre really young?(#10)I don't think checking your genitals is appropriate use to measure your cough. Yeah, this seems fishy. As a medical coder, this makes me think he is trying to get psid for a higher level visit. If you have a fixed  copay, then it won't cost you more,  just three insurance company.  If you pay co-insurance, then I would question the bill.(#11)is he a primary care doctor and were you there for a full physical? please say yes!(#12)Oh no, did you go to this type of doctor by any chance

https://www.reddit.com/r/funnysigns/comments/suq71f/free_exam/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Jokes apart, that test sounds more like annual exam(#13)He should have explained why he was checking your balls. If not then he‚Äôs not following medical compliance. I‚Äôd complain as it all sounds a bit rapey to me."
Apocalypse,21,0.9,36,"(#1)LOL I also think about this. I have no idea. I'd definitely become miserable and less healthy quickly, but how long would it take for those issues to cause a life threatening asthma attack...? No idea.(#2)I keep some stashed in my go bag. So ‚Ä¶ a few months. Then the zombies can catch me from the sound of my wheezing.(#3)I often wondered what people did before albuterol. Wait... crap, I was there before albuterol lol! 

They used epinephrine that really sped up the HR. and lots of vicks chest rubs and humidifiers. I was given a lot of coffee. Caffeine is supposed to help. 

If a zombie apocaplyse happens and your asthma is due to allergies don't forget to grab your epipens before you run... I guess? lol! 

Fun fact: Albuterol is a widely used bronchodilator. It is one of a series of compounds that were patented in 1972 by L. H. C. Lunts and co-inventors and assigned to Allen and Hanburys, a British pharmaceutical company that dated back to the early 18th century. (It eventually became part of the GlaxoSmithKline conglomerate.)

Also Albuterol sulfate was first approved for use in the United States in 1981(#4)I'd get my ass to the coast line so fast where it's warm and the air is filled with salt water.(#5)What about heart conditions? Haha i have one and i always think about it too. Guess only the strong survive‚Ä¶ :/(#6)I often ponder this scenario.

Another way of looking at it was how long ago would I have died if they had not invented rescue / preventative inhalers. And I'm old enough to remember when there were no inhalers. I dont think asthmatics ever got old back then.

But yes, when the apocalypse comes ..... while others are cleaning out the shelves of the grocery store I will be shooting my way to the pharmacy.

I can live on albuterol and water for a long time. I might even share my water ...... but not my albuterol.(#7)given the value for ‚Äúpeople who avoid plagues‚Äù‚Ä¶i could raid a pharmacy, and hole up and wait as they insisted on partying and drinking and zombieing each other. :D they‚Äôll run out of brains to nosh eventually. 

i keep a 3 month supply of my maintenance inhaler on deck anyway. if there was zombiism, i could probably get 6.

( i say we team up with the diabetics, and create like, a safe zombie free haven. we got the numbers.)(#8)I thought about this when there was a shortage here in 2020 (us wouldn‚Äôt send to Canada for a while). Since then I have a bunch in different bags.

Might be okay for a little while. But the all the other people with asthma will need some so I‚Äôll have to share.(#9)I have thought about this a LOT. I would do pretty well if I was in a warm climate and could sleep outside. Although if I had to run a lot I wpuld be absolute toast. I imagine there would be a lot of fires because, ya know, apocalypse, so that wouldn't help either. 

I feel like between not being able to see without glasses, my mental health and addiction issues I would *not* do so good.(#10)I think about this a lot and tbh I wouldn‚Äôt last longer than a week without meds even without the apocalypse lol(#11)Not gunna lie, if the apocalypse happened I‚Äôd probably make sure I wasn‚Äôt alive for it! I‚Äôll leave all my inhalers on my doorstep for you guys to use!(#12)Not long. That's why when the apocalypse starts my first job will be to raid pharmacies. And it's not about asthma only, without antibiotics and antiseptics we'll start dying like flies. So fist the medicine, then the weapons and then everything else.(#13)This pops into my head fairy often. I picture myself jumping the pharmacy counter and loading up on Advair.   Eventually it will start drying up from other asthmatics going through the same thing. Eventually I‚Äôd probably kill myself.(#14)I'm on daily Prednisone right now. So not long lol(#15)I‚Äôd do fairly fine as long as I don‚Äôt have to run too far, too fast, too long. Then it‚Äôs game over(#16)Not long but on the positive side, I‚Äôd be the loudest wheezing zombie walker.(#17)I have some other autoimmune issues as well, so to be honest I think I'll just show myself out the door at some point...(#18)Not as long as I would like.(#19)I would be ok for a couple of weeks without anything, but then I'd have a big attack.

Inhale the steam of simmering, salted water maybe? 
I'm not sure my body could take me having to go stomping about trying to find coltsfoot or jimsonweed to smoke. Hyssop I have growing in my garden, but it's a scrawny plant even after 3 years of growth.

But at least while everyone's breaking into pharmacies, I can break into herbalists and ayurveda stockists and hope that; although not as effective as modern medicine, I can hold stuff off with that?! I'm not sure how far turmeric and ashwagandha will get me though.(#20)I‚Äôve thought about this too. I love that they touch on this in World War Z. Brad Pitt breaks into a pharmacy to get Albuterol for his kid. So I guess I‚Äôd probably find Brad Pitt in the event of an apocalyptic event. üòâ(#21)Lol depends if I‚Äôm stuck in a place with a bunch of mold or cats. Honestly, I hate the fact that I rely on medicine to keep me healthy. I‚Äôd probably be miserable but who knows lol.(#22)usually i have 1-3 months of my perma-medication. after that: guess i'll die, can loot sth or find a chemist(#23)Haha i sometimes plan strategies in my mind for acquiring more inhalers when the zombie apocalypse strikes. I also think about where i would go and bunker up to survive"
Asthma Dreams,8,1.0,13,"(#1)If you‚Äôre using your rescue inhaler daily, you‚Äôre asthma is not well controlled. Please talk to your dr. Albuterol alone is NOT a good asthma treatment. You should also be on a maintenance inhaler or figure out what‚Äôs triggering your asthma daily.

I‚Äôve dreamt I couldn‚Äôt breath in my dream but then I wake up and I‚Äôm actually not breathing well. Never happens when I‚Äôm actually breathing fine though lol.(#2)I get asthma dreams from time to time. Scary as hell. The relief when I wake up and realize it‚Äôs a dream is incredible.(#3)I had a couple of dreams like that and woke up in the middle of an anaphylactic reaction.  I was taking Breo right before bed and Breo quit being good for me, I started reacting to it. Now if I have a dream about any breathing difficulty, I've trained myself to wake up and assess the situation.  It's kind of like when you start dreaming about toilets that don't work, you need to wake up to pee.(#4)Maybe this sounds like Ur Traumatised from ur Expiereince with Asthma-situations. 
Is this the case for you? 

Maybe it's time for a little Therapy, nothing bad with that (:(#5)I get tightness sometimes that goes away without using albuterol inhaler. I like to ride it out but know when I need to use it. I am using it less for this reason.

You probably are having a difficult time breathing if you wake up from not being able to breathe in your dream. It happened to me when my asthma was uncontrolled(#6)I have asthma attacks in my sleep occasionally and when I wake up from them I find I‚Äôve been dreaming about playing with dogs. (love dogs, but am allergic)"
Can childhood asthma coming back in teenage years?,2,1.0,3,"(#1)Ugh the dreaded lung itch. Yes asthma never goes away, it just goes dormant until something irritates it. It‚Äôs never a bad idea to see your dr about a heavy chest or lung irritation, especially since you had asthma as a child. I‚Äôd suggest seeing them sooner then later.(#2)Childhood asthma can come back at any time. You may have tested negative for covid but you may still have covid. Go see a doc.(#3)Asthma is genetic.   You have it; it can go dormant.   But just be aware if it comes back as you age.   See a specialist every few years to keep aware.   Maybe have an inhaler just in case; be aware of your triggers.  Mine when I was little was pollen and environmental and bronchitis ; now it‚Äôs expanded to food allergies and sensitivities; smells, smoke, etc."
Advice on medications,1,0.67,1,(#1)This is something you need to discuss with your doctor.
"Question aboud medication (salbutamol, spray)",1,1.0,2,"(#1)I would talk to your doctor about trying a controller med if you are using the salbutamol more than 2-3 times a week.

My doc has me do 2 puffs every 5-10 minutes if I'm having an attack.

In the US, we have to go with what our insurance covers and what the doctor submits to the pharmacy."
"I dropped my inhaler in the bath, is it still usable?",1,1.0,5,"(#1)Yes, no problem.

In fact, before inhalers had counters on them the only way to tell how much was in them was to drop them in the sink.

If they floated they were empty, if the sunk they were good.(#2)Test it, simple‚Ä¶(#3)Yes it is. Just be careful with any stickers. I wet one and the sticker started to break apart and I almost inhaled a piece that came off.(#4)Depends of the inhaler. I use easyhaler as my rescue inhaler. It‚Äôs a dry powder one, and the doses aren‚Äôt individually wrapped inside. So even a small amount of moisture can make it clogged up. If yours is an aerosol, it should be fine do.(#5)Disassemble it and wipe it well. Dry it. Reassemble and test."
Coupons for Advair HFA?,10,1.0,15,"(#1)Have you tried goodrx?(#2)Symbicort as alternative? Been taking it for years, works great(#3)https://www.gskforyou.com

Also GoodRx as mentioned. I use them. My insurance is a ‚Äúhigh deductible ‚Äú plan too.(#4)Try pharmstore.com . It‚Äôs super cheap. All you need is a paper prescription from doc, tell him to give you one.(#5)I order my Advair from alldaychemist for a few bucks a month. It‚Äôs crazy how cheap it is. I‚Äôve been using it for a while and have never had any issues with it(#6)Advair is a combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol. Why can't your doctor give you prescription generics of those two instead? Same effect, right? 

Hopefully goodrx or something like that will make it easier to just get what you need instead of skirting around with multiple generics. I have to admit one advair is easier than two other MDIs(#7)Use Global Care RX. It takes awhile to arrive but my Advair is $75(#8)In the US, yes?
I just got Wixela 250 (generic for Advair) from a local pharmacy using Goodrx for $150. (First time I got quoted $400 for Advair while on insurance I about cried.). Also - is Mark Cubans thing carrying Advair?(#9)Man i wish . i had to go off advair in 2018 cause it was too expensive . but i did get a substitute, flovant fha works just as well(#10)Good RX is the best right now. If you still can‚Äôt afford it, try a different inhaler?"
I just got over bronchitis last month. I'm sick again.,16,0.95,8,"(#1)Ugh I‚Äôm sorry. I had bronchitis a few months back and it sucked. Something that helped get the congestion out was Active Cycle Breathing.(#2)I'm sorry, this is the worst time of year for my asthma too. Hope you feel better soon.(#3)Shit sucks. I got a chest cold from a family member a few weeks ago and the phlegmy cough still hasn‚Äôt gone away. I already got tested for covid too ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è(#4)It could be atypical pneumonia, I get that instead of pneumonia that shows up on X-ray.  Treated with steroids pills, an antibiotic because it‚Äôs an infection in the lungs & codeine cough syrup.

anyone else??,3,0.72,3,"(#1)That's what iv bin doingbfor the last 4 days now....only I don't have any inhaler or nebulizer/medicine 
I'm ran out of them an don't gave health insurance anymore and am nervous to go to the ER"
Question about albuterol inhalers,1,0.57,9,"(#1)The blue one has the same medication as the red one.

Do you clean your inhaler?

If you are using the rescue more than 2-3 times a week, your asthma is NOT in control and you need to talk to your doctor about a controller med.(#2)I will trade you (facetiously, not seriously going to trade inhalers with anybody but my spouse and child). I love the blue ones, but the red ones - even freshly primed and straight out of the box - do nothing, and my insurance only covers the red ones.(#3)Possibly silly question but are you thoroughly shaking the aerosol cartridge before each puff? The propellant separates from the medication when it sits. If you‚Äôre only getting propellant halfway through the number of doses, something is definitely not right.

As others have suggested, it sounds like your asthma is not under control. A daily control medication certainly needs to be considered."
Possible asthma?,4,0.84,18,"(#1)You moved into a different environment. Have you tried antihistamines?(#2)Could be allergy induced asthma. You mentioned you were lying down, it could have also been acid reflux. It can cause shortness of breath and coughing and even flare up asthma if you already have it. If you can, try to go to an allergist to see what they have say about it.(#3)Whyd you move to VA? I might be moving from CA to florida haha

Maybe asthma, see a doctor and have some testing done. Could be allergies, anxiety, vocal chord dysfunction, etc.(#4)Have you ever been tested for allergies?(#5)Could be asthma, could be allergies to dust mites or something in your new environment or could be GERD. Do some research on Gerd and see if that fits your symptoms‚Ä¶ anyhow, you will have to see doctors and do testing in order to find out. You can try otc antihistamines and omeprazole/famotidine and see if this goes away‚Ä¶ you did not say how often this happens and if you wheeze or not but you need to start a journal and try to identify triggers and what symptoms you are experiencing. Good luck(#6)Oop, I live in Virginia. I feel like it‚Äôs definitely allergies. Just ask around and literally everyone who moves here suddenly has bad allergies. I‚Äôve lived in Virginia on and off- everytime I move here I have bad allergies. For ex, I would get dizzy, and get ear infections - never experienced that till I moved here. So doctors put me on Flonase and claratin. It stopped the ear infections, and fullness. Just an example of how the allergies here can do some weird things. I do have your symptoms too, and I got diagnosed with asthma. Idk, I want to blame Virginia but who knows."
Please...can I keep my cat?,21,0.93,56,"(#1)I have 6 cats and am allegedly allergic to them. I‚Äôm fine at home. If you keep them, make sure you stay on top of things. vacuum, litter boxes, have an air purifier,   Wash all the places they nap on (beds and blankets). 

My allergist knows I have cats. She‚Äôs never once told me to get rid of them. 

If they make you happy and you aren‚Äôt having any additional issues, keep them around.(#2)Ignore the doctor. It's a knee jerk reaction they give the minute you say you have a pet. If you are not reacting to the cat, you are not allergic.

I changed doctors when my doc told me to get rid of my cats even though I have zero reaction to them.(#3)They're not triggering your symptoms so as long as you keep your house cleanish (impossible with cats but do your best) it'll be fine. Your mental health can kill you too.(#4)Screw your doctor, frankly.  That‚Äôs a terrible attitude for them to take. 

I‚Äôve had zero allergic reaction to some cats, and some cats have been AWFUL for my allergies.  It can reeeeeally vary based on their dander, the length of their fur, etc etc. 

But no matter what, you love them and they‚Äôre important to you. 

Frankly I‚Äôd get a new doctor, because that one sounds like garbage.  But if that‚Äôs not an option, firmly stating that you will not consider getting rid of your cats and that you need to work on controller meds that help control your symptoms might be a good place to start. 

Good luck.(#5)If you have 2 cats currently, you would definitely know if you were allergic to them. The added dust is always going to be a potential irritant, so as someone else said make sure you stay on top of cleanliness in the house, but there‚Äôs absolutely no reason to advise ALL asthmatics to ALWAYS get rid of pets! We have a roomba (a different brand, I don‚Äôt remember which) and that really helps with dust levels in the house, it runs every day and obviously I‚Äôm not going to vacuum every day otherwise. We also use very low-dust litter and a covered litter tray to help prevent dust from that(#6)I'm allergic to my cat and I have FOUR.  2 fulltime and 2 parttime.  

Every so often I get a day where my eyes and nose run a lot, but for the most part, I'm fine.  Easily controlled with the occasional puff of Albuterol.  

Cats are necessary.  If you don't break out in hives from them, enjoy them.  

I won't tell you what my doctor says.  LOL(#7)I take allergy meds, I have a cat, I love her. I've had animals my entire life, my asthma is under control. I've found that I get better over time with a new pet introduced.(#8)Yes . i have moderate asthma and tested for a moderate reaction for cat allergy that makes my asthma act up real bad . when my asthma was out of control i was put on advair , it did wondrers , i was also put on nasal court but then singulair instead(#9)I am typing this while cuddling with my lil floofer kitty. I have always been allergic to cats. It hasn't always been easy thats for sure. I have found that it is possible with the right type of medication (for me it is flonase) and keeping everything clean. I live in a climate where I can let fresh air in at any time of the year and that helps immensely. Also make sure you wash your hands after cuddling the cat! 

If it is working for you then keep them. Just get a HEPA air filter, clean your bedding frequently and let in a lot of fresh air.(#10)My brother and I both have asthma and neither of us are allergic to non-pedigree cats but a few years ago he bought a Bengal cat and both of us are super allergic to it. When I visit him, within 5 minutes my eyes start streaming. He‚Äôs really suffering because of this cat and has his windows open even in winter and has air purifiers in every room. It really aggravates his asthma but he won‚Äôt get rid of the cat; it is very adorable. I used to have two cats and had no allergic reaction to them. If you‚Äôre not showing any allergy symptoms you should be ok but keep your house well ventilated and hoover a lot more than usual.(#11)It's a knee jerk reaction some doctors have. Oh you have cats you need to get rid of them without bothering to check if they are actually a problem. There is lots you can do to reduce allergens in your home without getting rid of the cats.(#12)If they don't trigger any symptoms, I don't get why your doc thinks they need to be rehomed. No, not everyone who is allergic is allergic to pet dander. No, not every asthmatic is allergic to cats. And if they are so worried about not knowing what you're allergic to, why haven't they got you tested yet?

If you can, I'd find a different doctor who actually knows their shit...(#13)my doctor told me the same. I asked him how long it would take to get the allergens out of my house and that takes a long time too. Might as well keep them :P(#14)I've never had an allergist or otherwise tell me to get rid of my cats, and I've owned/lived with cats my whole life. They're not a specific allergen for me, although my eyes can act up every once in a while, when I stuff my face in their bellies.

If you're not reactivating badly to having them around, there's zero reason to get rid of them.(#15)I personally wouldn't get rid of them unless you notice you are reacting to them. I love cats, but I developed allergies to cats when I was a preteen. Just keep your house clean and free from hair and dander.(#16)go get an allergy test done. theyll have cat on the tesf.(#17)Cats are the biggest nope in my asthma book. No issues with dogs though.(#18)purina ( i beliece) has a newer cat food that is supposed to help greatly reduce the cat dander allergen. invest in a quality hepa air purifier.  

i am highly allergic to my current cat,  i keep him out of my bedroom except for short visits and when he is in there i run the purifier at its highest setting.(#19)Doctor told me I was allergic to all kinds of trees, but I never felt it and I spent a lot of time out doors. He put me on allergy meds to help control the asthma. I never thought I needed them, but I gave it a try. I had never felt allergies until I started taking the meds, then it was like my nose never stopped running and I was sneezing all the time. So I just stopped taking them. I'm NEVER doing that again!!

TBH I hate cats, so personally I'd say get rid of them, but to each their own. If they don't cause an attack, keep them.(#20)Well, as long as you clean regularly there shouldn't be a problem, I would recommend an air purifier. I have 2 dogs and im allergic to them (cats too), they trigger my asthma, rhinitis and dermatitis but Im able to control the symptoms with meds. Because of this I don't sleep or cuddle with them (If you happen to be allergic to cats I would recommend not allowing them to your room, you will sleep way better).(#21)Apparently there's certain cat foods that will reduce the antigen that causes allergies in humans. Not sure about dogs but you could ask a vet or allergist perhaps.
Purina Pure Live is supposedly effective, you might want to try it.

https://www.aaha.org/publications/newstat/articles/2019-06/study-shows-a-change-in-feline-diet-could-curb-cat-allergies-in-people/

Aside from that, frequent bathing if they'll tolerate it would make a difference.(#22)I had and lived with 2 cats before and after getting diagnosed with asthma (mid 90s and mid 2000s),  they weren't a trigger or a complication.  My triggers are weather and season changes. My allergist I went to see around 2010 said to get rid of them and that I was also allergic to dogs. Total BS. My sis had a dog that was/is super affectionate and I was and still am super ok around her and the new dog too.(#23)When I lived with animals that shed, i used 180mg of fexofenadine a day and was able to comfortably co-exist. Had allergy/asthma friends who did the same.(#24)I have cat allergies and asthma, I remember getting stuck in the butt as a child for an extreme asthma attack when staying at my uncles house after hanging out with his long haired cat. So I believed it when I was told I couldn‚Äôt have cats. 

Well I got older and I knew I needed a cat in my life, I wanted a dog but it just wasn‚Äôt the time in my life for that. So I did research. A lot of what makes you allergic to cats is their saliva and their dander. Under that logic avoid things they frequent‚Äî my first cat Sven liked to sleep on my pillow so instead of letting him murder me with his cute pink nose and tongue I got him a blanket that he could sleep on next to my pillow. 

I also learned that the food you feed affects the amount of dander they produce and the type of kitty litter you use as well. I‚Äôm learning I‚Äôm very sensitive to the chemicals in the mass produced litter and use brands made of walnut shells, pine or wood‚Äî think sweet scoop, I think it‚Äôs called natures best(?) and for the love of god don‚Äôt use corn based litter. The sugar content of the corn refuse mixes with the ammonia of cat pee and it stinks so bad. 

The food is important‚Äî cats are meant to have a high protein diet so food with a lot of chemicals, filler and meal isn‚Äôt good for them and can result in a smellier more dander producing cat. I use dry food occasionally but usually use the Sheba brand because they list whole meats at the first ingredient.(#25)From my personal experience, after having my cats for  6 years, they don‚Äôt really bother my allergies and asthma. Others peoples cats I have noticed make my symptoms a little worse. Also my short haired cat will only cause irritation/hives when he rubs on my face. This trade off for love, I do not mind.(#26)Just vacuum regularly and use air purifiers. Keeps the dust at bay even if you aren‚Äôt allergic to cats(#27)I have two cats, asthma and dust mite allergy. Keep the place clean, definitely have an allergy vacuum with extra filters and no unnecessary carpets/curtains etc. My asthma at home isn't worse than anywhere else :)(#28)You should go to an allergist and get an allergy test to see what you are allergic to. I‚Äôve lived with a cat for 2.5 years and am allergic. At first it wasn‚Äôt that bad but now I‚Äôve been struggling breathing properly for the past 6 months and have to take a ton of meds. Shitty part is now I really love the cat. My suggestion would be to get tested before it could cause problems down the road and you get super attached."
Supplements that help with asthma?,6,0.8,10,"(#1)Supplements are great a making things thin‚Ä¶..mostly your wallet.(#2)Supplements don't really do anything.

My doc says the best thing to help with asthma is maintain a healthy weight and exercise.(#3)NAC(#4)Had created a similar post sometime back

https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/pzzs3a/apart_from_inhalers_what/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share(#5)I take NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine) occasionally however I attribute the greatest periods of relief for me being the purchase of a good humidifier and air purifiers.

General supplementation of Vitamins C and D are a must. 

Breathing exercises are very helpful for when you are feeling tight in the chest. You learn to be more in tune with periods of low oxygen so you don't experience an automatic increase in stress which can exacerbate things. Wim Hof has some great resources on this.(#6)Supplements can have allergens that cause asthma.  Asthma is genetic.  However, I take 3 - 1500 mg of Vitamin D3 (naturally it would be sunlight)‚Ä¶directed by my asthma specialist.(#7)Black seed oil"
Could I have Asthma all this time and not know?!,5,1.0,3,"(#1)You can develop asthma at pretty much any point in your life, like most diseases.  You can also ""grow out"" of asthma, as many people do as they transition from childhood into adulthood.  

Definitely get checked out by a doctor and be sure to tell them about your difficulties breathing, especially with exercise and stairs.  That certainly sounds asthmatic. 

Mucous is also closely associated with asthma, although personally I never really had a problem coughing it up.  It would all stay in my lungs and bronchial tubes, so I was always more of a wheezer than a cougher.  I coughed a lot, but it was always very dry. 

As an adult I don't cough.  I just get very tight in the chest.

Best of luck.(#2)Definitely get checked by a doctor. This community can't diagnose asthma but I have similar symptoms to you, so definitely get checked out(#3)I was diagnosed w/ asthma a couple years ago and I‚Äôm old enough to be your mother. The main symptom was coughing and coughing up phlegm. I coughed so much I broke 5 ribs. Found an excellent pulmonary doctor and Currently use 2 inhalers, Singulair and Fasenra. 

I‚Äôve been a life long distance runner and was shocked I was asthmatic. Adult onset asthma is becoming more prevalent and anyone can develop it. Highly recommend seeing a pulmonary doctor. Took 5 months to recover from a flare up with broken ribs. Asthma can be a creeping crisis. I wish you good health and healing."
Dupixent/Self injecting,2,1.0,2,(#1)Is this a prefilled syringe or a auto injector?
What do you do when you forget your inhaler?,21,0.88,56,"(#1)It might be a good idea to have one that the nurse at school keeps, at least this is the way it works at my childrens‚Äô schools.(#2)Get more than one prescribed, I have them all over the place. Like I legit probs have 8(#3)You are probably not supposed to but I bet there are other kids that have them that would share in a pinch if it‚Äôs still albuterol. I would also in that case have them call my parents to bring it, assuming they are close enough.(#4)If it happens at school, go to the nurse. They'll help you figure out what to do.

I keep an inhaler in my purse, one beside my bed, and one in the car. When it's bike riding weather, I keep one in my bike bag. Usually my doctor will prescribe several refills, so I get it filled every month until I have enough for the places I want to keep them.(#5)When I was in school my doctor and I came up with a plan that I would have two inhalers. I would always keep one on my backpack and one by my bedside. Idk if your doctor would do the same but it never hurts to ask.  that way you don‚Äôt really need to move it everywhere and it‚Äôll be harder to not have it where ever you are(#6)Black coffee is said to help. Not sure if it‚Äôs the same for everyone or if it works for an attack but it works for me when I‚Äôm feeling really tight chested and nearing an attack.(#7)My insurance company allows me to get 3 inhalers at a time,  they understand that this 2 thing you need everywhere.  This way I keep 1 at bedside, 1 downstairs and 1 in my purse. I always refill as soon as I‚Äôm able so that I can keep one in husband‚Äôs car etc.  

It must have been frightening to be without one.  Can you talk to your parents about getting multiples?(#8)You'll just remember after you've forgotten a few times.(#9)Are you able to talk to your parents about this? Maybe show them some suggestions from people who have also gone through this. Best wishes.(#10)Sit down, relax, put your arms over your head, and try to calm your breathing.(#11)I remember taking my inhaler at the nurse office gosh that was 15 years ago üòÇ(#12)I have ~5 or so of them scattered between my purse, work bag, car, night stand, and my parents house.... So usually I'm at least near 2 of them at any given time. 

Also if your get random asthma attacks enough that you're worried about forgetting it, you need to ask your doctor about maintenance meds.

Lastly if you get asthma attack without your inhaler nearby, sit down, and have someone rythmically hit your back between your shoulder blades repeatedly for 10-20 min. That's the only non-medication method aside from adrenaline rush that has ever helped me. Make sure they are hitting your back pretty hard with either ball of their hand or bottom of first, not painfully but hard, 1-2 hits per second tempo for 10+ minutes. Only works on mild-med asthma attacks.(#13)Sit up straight. And just focus on breathing. Eventually my throat opens back up. Also try the following; two table spoons of honey ( I think it helps the mucus slide down ur throat), and get boiling hot water in a bowl and hover ur face over it breathing in the hot vapour. üëçüèΩ be safe(#14)Recently, I had a bad attack and didn‚Äôt have it with me, and I found that mimicking breathing through a straw really helped. Slow, deep breaths (as deep as you can, I know that‚Äôs tough!) with your lips pursed like you‚Äôre almost whistling. 

Also, if you can get some sprite or ginger ale- a clear, carbonated liquid, that can help too.(#15)When I was your age I kept a designated puffer bag on me when I was younger then  kept it in my purse when I was a bit older . You can probably get a separate one for school and just leave it in your locker or someplace where it can stay on campus. 

When you have an attack without one caffeine helps like black tea . Also running warm water and steaming up a room works great too .(#16)Tripod sitting position helps me. Google tripod position asthma and give it a try(#17)I unused to have multiple ones so I keep the spares in different spots that I go to(#18)I have about 6-8 inhalers scattered between various bags, pockets, and places I go regularly (I.e. work.). On the rare occasion I‚Äôve ended up having an attack and no inhaler on me, I‚Äôve been lucky enough that somebody has let me pinch a salbutamol inhaler from them.  All else fails, I do the same thing I do when my inhaler isn‚Äôt working, and head to AE.  The best thing though is to have plenty of spares and scatter them in important places (bedside drawer, bag you use most frequently, etc.). That way the chances are you will always have one to dig out should you need it.(#19)You can get something like a SPI belt which is not noticeable under clothes. Then when you change for gym don‚Äôt take it off so when you‚Äôre out running around for gym class you still have the belt and inhaler on you, and literally at all times. Add the belt to your morning routine like you would socks or underwear. When you take it off, put it in your sock or underwear drawer or your shoe. That way while you get used to it, you have a very obvious reminder to put the belt on. Make sure your name is on the belt or at least on a piece of paper in the belt. And write your name on your inhalers. 

Also ask the doctor about taking a puff before exercise if you find the shortness of breath to happen a lot when you exercise. 

Talk to your parents and maybe doctor about when your next refill is available. Ask for it to be filled as soon as possible so you can leave an inhaler in your backpack just in case you do forget to bring it.(#20)Suffer(#21)Commit to nose breathing.

It helps stabilize just the right amount of air, try to avoid overwhelming smells, and focus on keeping calm(#22)Im 13 too and when i forget my inhaler i just have to sit down and take deep breaths(#23)Aa others have written, definitely have a backup one! I have two for daily use (one in a bag and one in a jacket) plus another one in the fridge. It makes me feel so much more relaxed and I can still use them up, so nothing is wasted.(#24)Most schools have asthma protocols and the school nurse has to have signed off procedures with your doctor and you parents; and possibly store one for you or maybe keep one in your backpack but the nurse should be notified.(#25)Get sad and Cry, call my mom, ask my siblings if they have theirs, call the nurse, take a shower, drink caffeine, if you really need to call 911 if it gets really bad."
A Case of Persistent Asthma Resistant to Available Treatment Options: Management Dilemma,1,0.6,1,(#1)It's a shame you're being downvoted. It was an interesting read!
Allergy not showing on test?,2,1.0,1,"(#1)hi there , when i had my test it showed up very promentatpy but here is the twist before i got tested for years i knew i had allergies so i was wearing masks when cleaning , wearing gloves and keeping windows open and recently got a air purifier"
Sometimes I wake up & my lungs hurt a bit. I have asthma and was wondering if that‚Äôs a symptom. My inhaler makes it feel a bit better. Is it asthma?,1,0.6,4,"(#1)Sounds like a question for your doc.(#2)Are you a smoker? I have asthma and i smoke weed and my lungs occasionally hurt when i wake up. Your lungs hurt because they are inflamed. This could be caused by a number of factors though.

Allergies can cause this especially at night. Stress can cause this. Did you have a nightmare? Obv smoking can cause this. Your inhaler works because thats what its designed to do: reverse the inflammation in the lungs so that the airways are more open.

So is it asthma? Yes and no. Asthma is just a clinical diagnosis that your lungs are prone to inflammation of the airways do to a number of causes. If you want to stop the inflammation you have to get to what is triggering it and them try to eliminate that trigger from your life.

Me i just choose to keep triggering my asthma and use medication to get relief. Albuterol is a wonderful invention. Good luck"
Taking Singulair/Montelukast With History Of depression,28,0.95,36,"(#1)Many asthma medications come with mood changes/anxiety/depression symptoms as side effects. I don't know that you'll find one that won't come with the possibility of a mood-related side effect - steroids (like rescue inhalers) can cause anxiety and mania, even in people with no previous history of bipolar, and non-steroidal allergy meds can cause tiredness (which can exacerbate depression symptoms), even if they don't have mood changes listed as a side effect. I have ptsd and have responded poorly to ""safe"" asthma/allergy medications in the past because my mood is particularly sensitive to anything that can cause drowsiness.

The best option, if you're concerned, is to track your mood and contact your doctor right away if you start to notice your mental health changes or gets worse. It may not be possible to give you something in which mood changes are not a possible side effect, but instead the goal would be to find one that you don't react (too) negatively to and probably supplement with (additional) mental health treatment if necessary. 

From [the warning](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a600014.html) I'm reading right now, it looks like the possible mood changes are similar to ones for meds like zoloft or steroids - they can cause mania/mania-like symptoms, anxiety, or depression. If you have someone who lives with you or can check in with you, make sure that they know what to look out for. tbh, the issue is less the possible depression symptoms - you're aware you have depression, so I presume you have a plan in place if you need help (and if you don't, make sure to do that!) - and more so the possible mania symptoms. I had a bad reaction to zoloft a couple years back that caused symptoms not unlike mania, and was unable to make appropriate decisions while I was affected - it took my friends and family all insisting that I contact my doctor to get me to actually do it and get my dose adjusted so I'd level out.

If you're concerned about the possibility of having suicidal thoughts and being hyped up (mania can make it so you feel like you have to act on any thought that enters your head and gives you the energy to do so, so it can increase the risk of an attempt), make sure to remove anything from your home that you could use to hurt yourself and seek help immediately if you feel the need to act on any thoughts. fwiw when I experienced a drug-induced mania, it only took about 15 minutes after my first dose to start feeling the high, and I was in a fully manic state within 3 hours. The symptoms were completely gone after about five days (after a dose change on day 3), and I didn't experience them again the entire rest of the time I was on the med. Not saying there isn't a possibility you could have a reaction later on, but it's possible that if you aren't feeling any changes now, you might not.(#2)I've been taking it for almost 15 years (the smaller dose for children and then onto adult dose).
I have severe anxiety/depression but between my trauma and family history of mental illness that isn't surprising.

I think sometimes people are too quick to jump to their current medication being the cause, rather than considering other factors. It wasn't until I was properly assessed for depression that I realised I've had it nearly all my life, even back into childhood.(#3)I have anxiety and depression. I've been on it for at least 10 years, and don't recall any drastic worsening of my depression.(#4)It has not been an issue for me and I am on medication for depression, etc.  I think trying it with an awareness of the symptom to keep an eye out for is a fair approach.(#5)I was given pill form..stopped at 4 days.  Called doctor up and said no way.  I was sad and down and edgy.  Never like that.   She did warn me if I experienced this type of reaction to stop taking and call her.(#6)My personal experience is that it makes me extremely anxious and depressed, and the onset of those side effects when I start taking it is sudden enough that it's like flipping a switch. But it's also a wonder drug. I take it every spring when my seasonal allergies get bad (even with daily antihistamines and other allergy meds, there comes a point when my eyes swell shut, which makes it hard to function as a human being). Prednisone gives me worse side effects and would be the next course of action, so to me, it becomes worth the tradeoff when allergy or asthma symptoms reduce my quality of life more than the side effects would.

But my siblings have also taken Singulair for asthma and allergies without noticing any side effects. It really depends on your own body chemistry how you'll react to it. As with any medication, consult with your doctor and monitor yourself for side effects.

My biggest question for you would be whether Singulair is the first thing your doctor prescribed as a controller, or if it's being added in addition to another controller medication that isn't doing enough. I wouldn't recommend Singulair as a first-in-line medication. I'd try an inhaled steroid or a steroid/LABA combo first, and then only do the Singulair if that isn't enough to get your asthma under control, because with a history of mental health issues there are other medications that might be less risky and work just as well.(#7)I have anxiety and depression, and the Montelukast hasn't changed either in any noticeable way.(#8)Changed my fucking life. Worst thing I have ever done. Took it for nine months. Was not aware of side effects. I was told about it bad dreams that‚Äôs it. From voices in the head, loss of personality, hallucinations, and then a severe 1.5 year withdraw (not typical) I‚Äôm off. Look on Facebook for a support group. You are not alone. The drug got a black box warning last year. Some countries have since outlawed after reviewing and performing new testing. It changed my life. This is not what they are telling you. Please use it as a last resort. But anything but that. I could breathe sure. But I traded 27 years of life that I was happy with. They did not trial and test this drug in the 90‚Äôs like they would today. They changed the warning on the drug from it may cross the Blood Brain barrier to it will. It rewires you. It hurt. My mom has been on it 20 years. All her shit is with it too. There‚Äôs been some big news cases and studies on it. But it‚Äôs generic now. You can‚Äôt sue. It‚Äôs a nasty spur in the cog wheel of health. Not advised at all. I never was depressed before meds. I‚Äôve tried to kill myself so many times. I didn‚Äôt mean to either it was like something else in me was trying to kill me. I am three years off. Way better than I was six months ago. But I still have some lingering issues. If you have only been on a couple days or just today I recommend stopping asap. Drink a lot of water and avoid artificial dyes for a couple days. If you lack a processor that breaks down the Montelukast sodium results are a bit skewed. Stay strong. I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre off. I‚Äôd rather not breathe and have 50% blood oxygen for the rest of my life than ever take one more. I remember some people in our support group that also did heroin that were clean. They said heroin was easier to get off of.(#9)Ruined my life. Made me aggressive and angry all the time. Then came suicidal thoughts. I ended two relationships before I realized what was making me like that. I am back to normal now without it, but have permanently high blood pressure from raging for years on Singulair.(#10)I've been on singulair for a month now. I'm also on prozac for anxiety and depression. 
Singulair hasn't impacted my mood at all(#11)I used to take montelukast since i was 14. I stopped last year when i was 23 and in very bad mood. I thought that it was affecting me but i also communicated the fact that I will stop taking it with my doctor. If u can ask your doctor if its hard to ask him u can see or write down how u are feeling mentally each day and if u see a change in a bad way then think about a change of this medicament or better talk to the doctor. Wish you all the best and dont give up! It was hard for me to go out from the black hole but I did so you will do it too! üòéüòâ(#12)Quick question, how fast after first dose will you notice these angry/suicidal side effects? I've been on it for 2 weeks and it's helped my asthma BIG time. I've been a little edgy but nothing out of the norm.(#13)Just watch your mood. The stuff is a wonder drug. I take 5mg at night, for years. Even a little bit helps a ton. I‚Äôve been on the kid dose for years. I also take one puff of Dulera in the morning, and that‚Äôs it. Without the Singular added in the mix, I feel a big difference in my sinus issues and asthma. I workout a lot, and train grappling martial arts. Singular makes a HUGE difference in my breathing and cardio output with exercise. I deal with depression, and I take 100mg of Lamotrigine. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever affected my mood. It hasn‚Äôt made it worse, but it‚Äôs made my asthma and sinus problems tremendously better. Everyone is different. Don‚Äôt get spooked about it from a few comments. I would say to give it some time. For me, it makes a massive difference in my quality of life. Even at a really small dose.(#14)29M here. I‚Äôve been on singulair for about a year and a half now. I have a history of anxiety/depression from about 18-22. After that, my mental health has been pretty well maintained. I started to notice a HUGE increase in the amount of nightmares in the last year and decided to take a look at the side effects of all my allergy/asthma meds. Once I saw the mental side effects of singulair I stopped it for about 2 weeks and noticed a decrease in nightmares but my allergies got worse. So I went back on it and have noticed a huge increase in my anxiety/depression and now suicidal thoughts. I dint even feel like myself. I need to find an alternative asap(#15)I have anxiety + depression. I have not had any issues on it. Been on it for over a year.(#16)I'm on both Montelukast and venlafaxine. No mental health effects from montelukast for me.(#17)Took it for 3 whole days. Had 3 days of constant panic attacks. Stopped taking it. Felt better a few days later(#18)I have anxiety & depression and no worsening of symptoms on it. If anything I feel better able to cope..(#19)I took montelukast for a few days and slept roughly 48 out of the 72 hours I took it. It's definitely not for everyone.

If you're worried about mood changes, it might be helpful to document your symptoms (physical or mental) in a journal/log. This way it will be easy to tell if there has been a negative trend in your mood. The only way to tell if it works for you is to try it. I wish you good luck and I hope you don't get any side effects :D(#20)I had pretty immediate negative symptoms with singular. I noticed my mood got much worse and the nightmares were brutal. After about two weeks of trying to tough it out I had a dream so horrific I put the stuff down for good. But I also tend to get every worst side effect with meds lol. Def worth giving a try, just make sure to be careful. I‚Äôm not the only one with this experience.(#21)I am tapering down my montelukast script . I have been taking it for 4 months. My motivation is sorely lacking, I have sleep disturbances,  and mood swings.(#22)[deleted](#23)I went to get allergy tested and my doctor took me off my singulair. Essentially if the benefits don't outweigh the risk, consider another alternative. Disclaimer, I'm not a doctor. :D

Edit: I took singulair for a little while, but not sure my symptoms would help you much. I do suffer from mood disorder and take various meds for it. All I can say for sure is that coming off of it did not make me feel worse. It's worth considering if you notice drastic changes. Definitely keep your doc in the loop though!"

Long-term side effects from taking montelukast as a child? (Tics),1,0.54,12,"(#1)My kids all took it, no problems.  I doubt the association really.(#2)You‚Äôre 18. Montelukast has had updated labeling since 2008 regarding neuropsychiatric events (specifically agitation, depression, sleeping problems, and suicidal thoughts).

This was known info far before you took it at that age. Which means your physician weighed the risks and benefits for you, and your mom agreed. 

The 2019 info and black box warning come from the fact that those risks likely don‚Äôt outweigh benefit in folks with mild asthma. It‚Äôs not because there was any increase in events since 2008. Long story short, the 2019 issuance of the black box warning is sensationalized by the media, the drug remains incredibly helpful to a subset of patients with severe disease.(#3)I took montelukast from ~10-18, then again from 24-now (just shy of 29). 

As a teenager I was extremely depressed and often felt suicidal, but I also went through a period of bad depression at 22-23 when I wasnt taking the drug, so I have never attributed it to montelukast. No tics either.

I'm sorry for what you're going through. As a depressed teenager I used a lot of heavy drugs to cope and I am living with significant health problems as a result. It sucks to be stuck with consequences of things you were exposed to as a child, especially in your case where you didn't know it was harmful. If it helps, I am generally happy now and married to a wonderful woman who is very supportive. I believe that, if this is something you are never able to solve medically, you will learn to live with it and it will not keep you from being happy.

Just a thought though, did you get covid? Long covid has all sorts of weird side effects, maybe this is a result of that?(#4)What I learned from it from my recent visit to my neurologist i ended up asking why do I have tics/Tourette‚Äôs if I wasn‚Äôt born with it nor did any of my family have it and it came to a conclusion from my neurologist that the chemicals throughout puberty whether in boys or girls they can develop due to that same reason. The chemicals in the brain are all going crazy due to puberty in someone so it may have been due to that.(#5)Hey feel free to message me. You are not alone. It‚Äôs highly alienating. There are support groups for people who took it and have had side effects. They range massively. It changed my life after 27 years of what I knew it flipped it upside down. It‚Äôs been about three years since I stopped meds. Life is better- but the road is unique for all. What is your diet like now? Do you have flashbacks?(#6)hey omg similar boat here.

took singular (montelukast) for a few years when i was young, (born with asthma) and i don‚Äôt exactly remember why i stopped taking it but i do remember having the most terrifying dreams that still haunt me till this day, which i told my mom about several times and that could be the reason? i‚Äôm not sure but in any case, i don‚Äôt know when these tremors/tics started. 

i don‚Äôt know if anyone around me ever noticed but as of late i noticed them one day out of the blue by watching a video of myself someone filmed because i didn‚Äôt notice it. after sometime i started realizing it. the tremors make my head shake/jolt for like a second and then that‚Äôs it. sometimes it shakes in bursts multiple times like 2-4 times which is rare. 

no one in my family has them. my asthma was very severe as a baby, which recessed in my early teens, then around 17/18 till now 21 its gotten worse and more frequent problems and attacks, and it‚Äôs only as of the last two years or so that i‚Äôm aware of my head jolting randomly.

it doesn‚Äôt really bother me, just feels weird. and i know when it‚Äôs about to about happen about 2 seconds from it happening which is weird

i don‚Äôt know if indeed montelukast was the source of this but i‚Äôm going to probably talk to my pharmacist about it"
Is Meloxicam 15 mg pill bad to take to feel better from chest pain? I want to take it sort of but online it says it can cause a heart attack or a stroke. Should I not take it one day or at all?,0,0.5,13,"(#1)Real talk if you don't know, ask an advice nurse or a doctor. You cannot verify anyone on here is qualified to make a call.

Advil can also cause a heart attack or stroke. Dont let internet side effects prevent you from taking prescribed meds.

My kiddo bruised her lungs. Did that happen to you? If so, yes chest pain is normal.(#2)This is a question for your doctor.(#3)Did your doctor prescribe meloxicam (a prescription-only medication) for the pain you're currently dealing with? If so, go ahead and take it. If not, you should just utilize advil or Tylenol.(#4)Costochondritis is probably what's causing the pain. It's very unlikely that Meloxicam would cause a stroke or heart attack."
asthma/allergies,4,1.0,4,"(#1)I should add, ive had a few chest xrays and all came back normal as well as EKG tests.(#2)This sounded exactly like me about 18 months ago. I'm only just started to get over the panic attacks which were completely random. 

Still have asthma but never struggled with it prior, I can only assume I caught something as it started as a dry cough and breathlessness.

Things that helped me was using NAC to help clear mucus out of my chest. 

Gotta Drop the cigarettes though, it stunts the hairs that remove mucus from your lungs. If you have congested lungs then prepare for plenty of chest infections.(#3)I haven‚Äôt had the need to take the nebulizer treatment since I was a kid. But other than that I‚Äôve had lifelong allergies and asthma since I was a kid. It is very much so a double whammy allergies are a very common trigger especially pollen and pet allergies. Stress also makes asthma worse. Now that think about it this probably has a lot to do with your pregnancy. You may want to buy an indoor air filter. I also find showers help with allergies. Other than that take your medicine, and if your having problems with your medicine write them down and tell your doctor."
How to get rid of dry cough after respiratory infection?,13,1.0,10,"(#1)I can't help solve your problem. But I can definitely sympathise.

The post-viral cough is a killer. Damn 6-12 weeks after a cold, the damn lungs/chest is coughing all day and night.

Its not a good look during COVID times.(#2)Hey Fellow survivor, i‚Äôm also in the same boat. Had asthma since childhood and now it‚Äôs manageable, reduced to sport induced asthma (any physical excursion) triggers it. 

Jan-Feb sucked with the cold/warm weather swings. I finally got cleared today from my flu after dealing with this sickness crap for 2 weeks. Things which worked for me: 

1) Cold mist humidifier for nights, keeps the dryness out which triggers the coughs. 
2) 1-2 tablespoons of warm raw honey with crushed (powder) black pepper. It soothes the throat, and  clams the itchiness out. Sleep like a baby after it. 
3) Get some fresh outside air after rescue inhaler, it helps to loosen the airways and get the meds working better. 

Hope these things help you out(#3)Call your primary care provider and tell them what's going on. If you're lucky, maybe they'll call in a script for a cough syrup that actually works without an office visit.(#4)A course of prednisone usually knocks it right out for me. Over the counter I do mucinex and Sudafed.(#5)Try a nebuliser with saline solution. It's more for shifting gunk when you have an infection but if moisture helps it might help.(#6)When I get that, I use 

1. A humidifier in the room I'm in at the moment. Yes, I have it running day and night, You may only need it at night. My doctor only recommended me to have it running constantly.
2. Mucinex and Sudafed should clear you up. If not, contact your doctor for something stronger, like Prednisone or something.
3. Drink a bunch of water, tea, or something hydrating. Just stay hydrated. It'll loosen up the stuff in your lungs and get you coughing. And you will get it all cleared.(#7)I use Manuka honey. 2 spoons per day(#8)Well, I had the same symptoms but I IGNORED them for months. Ended up having pharyngitis. Hope you are doing allright!"
Frustrations,6,0.88,4,"(#1)if youre having uncontrolled symptoms it can cause a horse voice happened to me last year .(#2)I totally understand and is very frustrating when your asthma doesn't act like a normal asthma...I'm in same boat especially the past year. My old pulmonologist moved and was doing OK, until last 2yrs and went downhill like you. Got a new pulmonologist last year and is determined to figure me out. My blood work was showing my immune system out of wack, but wasn't sure if it was all the steroids I had and was one caustic, but he also talked about eosinophils which if high will trigger chronic asthma and gets severe. The only problem to check to see if your eosinophils are high you need to be off steroids for a few months. He also set me up with an Immunologist as they too cover asthma, allergies and autoimmune.. they were able to get me well enough to get off steroids for at least 3 months, went and had blood work done to check my immune system and eosinophils.  My immune system came back to normal and my eosinophils went up high. The good thing is if your eosinophils are high, there is an injection to knock them out to bring your levels down. Google Eosinophilic Asthma...and talk to your dr about this. My Immunologist still believes I have an underlying condition because I am still having trouble when I get a bad asthma attack and so we just had a high resolution CT scan of my lungs front and back cos I keep getting infections. Good luck, and hope hey figure you out also.(#3)Have you ever been evaluated for gastric issues where you mention an attack in your sleep? Have you been evaluated for sleep apnea?"
"New to bad attacks, sorry for the book.",3,1.0,3,"(#1)Im allergic to dogs and cats (8 years ago), now im allergic to grass, pollen and dust. This shit is crazy but dont be alarmed if allergies are triggering your flare ups. 

I use heavy air filters and cold mist humidifiers, they help with allergies and dryness which causes irritational coughs leading to asthma attacks.

Also be careful with prednisone (steroids) courses, never miss a dose and dont take (5-day) course back-to-back. My mom missed few doses and the doctor asked her to redo the course which triggered her Type-II diabetes.(#2)Yes, bad irritation causes flare ups, and if you don't get them under control, it just spirals. Your doctor has the right idea. 

Clearing out your living space, using filters & humidifiers, and being really, really careful with how you reintroduce potential allergens. 

You can also get allergy tested to see what your actual triggers are so you know what to avoid. 

If you need help with figuring out and managing food and environmental factors, I've seen some people have success with getting help from a functional medicine coach or practitioner. They help you figure all the allergy & environmental stuff out.(#3)You may be one of the unlucky one with long covid."
Severe Asthma.,22,1.0,53,"(#1)I've had severe asthma my whole life ...finally got treatment at 38  Flovent HFA  twice a day makes it so i don't have to use my rescue inhaler ......going on 2 years without having to use it... shits 225.00  month but i can't live without it(#2)Are you on a long acting inhaler?(#3)As another sever asthma sufferer with terrible anxiety, I've experienced exactly what you're describing and funnily enough it happened to me around the same time. After going to many docs and doing tons of tests, it turned out that GERD (typical acid reflux) and LPR (silent reflux) was causing a lot of my issues. Aside from irritating my lungs, the reflux caused discomfort in my throat/airways giving me a false sense of shortness of breath leading to me to believe I was having difficulty breathing.

My asthma is still certainly there and I'm on a daily controller medication (Symbicort) but once I dealt with the reflux problem, 90% of my symptoms subsided over a few weeks and they only flair up now and then when my reflux is bad. The other 10% was calming down my anxiety that I couldn't breath and reassuring myself that I was ok after checking my peak flow and SpO2 numbers.

Can't say for sure if this is what's happening to you but I'd say to get it checked out.(#4)I've had severe asthma my whole life and it flares up about once a year for a solid 1-2 months where I can't get a deep breath. Id be sitting and struggling to breath. I know how you feel, its scary. I tried prednisone, albuterol, nebulizer, advair, singulair, etc etc. Finally looked at natural remedies and came across pynogenol. It reduces inflammation in the body, including airways. I was able to breath again within 24 hours of taking it, I kid you not. I highly recommend it, since it sounds like your symptoms were very similar to mine!(#5)Have they tried adding an inhaled steroid like asthmanex with a does of singular (pill)?(#6)definitely anxiety can make your asthma symptoms a lot worse especially if your asthmas already bad . it can be a combo of both(#7)Could be a Zinc deficiency. Try 50mg per day for 2 weeks, then reduce to 30mg per day. If this is the issue you should see results within a few days. This dosage is for zinc citrate, which is what I take for my asthma.(#8)If albuterol doesn't provide relief, it's most likely anxiety. If you suffer anxiety, I would recommend seeing a therapist.

If you have severe asthma, you also need to talk to your doctor about adjusting your controller med You should not need the rescue inhaler more than 2-3 times a week when you're on the right med.(#9)How does your shortness of breath feel like? And what are your triggers?
I kind of have a similar story to yours(#10)Have you seen an allergist / asthma doctor.  There‚Äôs more options that that doctor can help you with. Something that might help is taking your level of deep breaths (don‚Äôt push it or it will be contra-indictatory)"
Advice from fellow cough variant asthmatics?,15,1.0,34,"(#1)This might be an odd thing related to me, but adding on the Incruse Ellipta inhaler was the only thing that really worked (I‚Äôm on Breo normally). 

And when I was really bad, getting albuterol + ipratropium worked way better for me than just albuterol alone (in urgent care). 

Not sure if it could help you but it is common to have a LAMA drug as an add on. 

You might also want to go in a combo inhaler.(#2)How do you find what variant of ashtma you have(#3)I don‚Äôt know if cold air is a trigger, but if so cover your mouth and nose in cold weather.(#4)Hello. This is me to a T. I am on Flovent, with an albuteral emergency inhaler. I buy cough drops and Mints. Steam is my friend. Believe it or not, the cold actually helps me breathe better. I know that doesn't work for everyone. Yet steam is also soothing, go figure.(#5)The only thing that has helped my cough is going gluten-free or minimal gluten. I feel off the wagon and had asthmatic bronchitis 3 times in 5 months.(#6)I‚Äôm on mostly everything you are on, except for nasal spray I use Nasacort. Mine is pretty well controlled with all that. 

If you are having consistent trouble, I‚Äôd get back in with your doctors or an allergist. Are you doing anything kind of allergy treatment as well?(#7)I never knew there was an official name for coughing instead of wheezing! 

I am allergic to dust, so keeping the house as dust-free as possible helps. I cover my mouth when outside as cold air is a trigger too. Exercise is a trigger, so I try to do light exercise that doesn't make me breathe heavily. Running a humidifier in the winter helps me some too.(#8)My asthma is triggered by a cold usually and then followed by weeks of coughing. My treatment is usually albuterol/breo. 
Azythromicin is added if I develop pneumonia.
Then if these 3 haven‚Äôt worked than doctor prescribes prednisone(#9)I'm on symbicort,singulair, and now spiriva. The spiriva is what was the game changer for me.(#10)Please consider that you have lpr, my asthma is caused by acid aspirating into my lungs and irritating it. This does not have to feel like heartburn at all. Once I reduced my acid reflux my asthma went away (and the dry cough)(#11)Unpopular opinion here‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm going to get roasted here but I‚Äôve been using Scott‚Äôs emulsion basically cod liver I took 10cc daily And haven‚Äôt used my abuterol since December. Where I was using 3 to 4x daily. I finished 3 bottle and now and I‚Äôm taking a break from it so if my symptoms start I will start again. I‚Äôm hoping it helps you the one I use comes in flavors so it wasn‚Äôt so bad. I‚Äôve also given it to my son and his asthma was worst than mine. He‚Äôs also not used his inhaler since Nov."
Quit smoking yesterday (4-7 cigs a day) and now I feel worse,3,0.81,6,"(#1)Not surprising considering your body is heading into a very stressful state from the withdrawals.

Quit 8 yrs ago, but still have asthma.(#4)this can happen , ive dealt with this myself . when you feel bad just take your rescue inhaler and stuff and continue with your preventative inhaler also(#5)As everyone says, definitely an adjustment period.

Covid chest pain,6,1.0,15,"(#1)When I had COVID the pain that I had whether that be joint pain or chest pain was only helped with Tramadol.

First time I had COVID (the OG strain) I had chest pain very similar to pneumonia. Lung pain in my upper chest and back. 

Second time I had Delta and I had minimal to no lung issues when I was sick. Lung shit came after. I had pure joint pain second time.(#2)I got a short term prescription for symbicort. It basically dealt with the shortness of breath.(#3)I had chest pain, it seemed to show up after my shortness of breath was resolved, the way it does sometimes after a bad asthma attack. Holding a pillow against my chest when I coughed helped a little bit, also wearing a soft bra so I had some support seemed to make it better. I used Icy Hot lidocaine gel because the pain was bad enough that I couldn't sleep.

I was using a pulse ox so I was fairly confident my pain was muscle pain and not because of a current breathing problem. If you think it might be breathing rather than muscle related, you should get seen somewhere.(#4)Chest pain means you should be going to urgent care.(#5)Sounds like costochondritis. Try some ibuprofen or Tylenol and lots of water(#6)How is your coughing so far? I had terrible coughing plus flare up together. I coughed till I vomited, I had chest pain when I had covid 3 weeks ago along with upper back pain. It liked you cough from front chest the dull, sharp pain come straight to your back. I went to ER because chest pain was so bad that I could not walk straight or talked properly. The ER doctor checked everything and told me its my muscle pain. And it would go away when I get better. I still have chest pain and upper back pain until today, my coughing just stopped about last week but the pain is still there. If you do not have any fever, i think just muscle pain because of coughing too much. However just double check with the Dr. And maybe try some paracetamol, or pain killer, however, if you have asthma, do not use ibuprofen.(#7)I had intermittent chest pain from day 5 to day 15. I went to urgent care who then recommended going to hospital to rule out blood clots. All tests came back fine and I was released. They recommended ibuprofen which helped to subside the pain. And then magically all of my chest pain subsided."
Success stories of Xolair?,7,1.0,16,"(#1)It did nothing for me but I wish you luck.

Albuterol is a rescue.(#2)I‚Äôve stopped having regular serious flare-ups and taking Singulair since I‚Äôve been on it.(#3)I've been on it for three  years. Before, felt like I was drowning, chest always congested.  Now, totally normal, barely use my rescue. Still take a maintenance dose of Advair 2x daily, and haven't been able to get off that.  As everone says, results are mixed.  FYI, my insurance just switched me to self administering at home, which is much nicer.(#4)did you have a blood test done to check eosinophils and IGE? Since Xolair is an anti IGE, it makes sense that if your IGE is high that Xolair is indicated. 

I took xolair for around 10 years and it worked great considering my starting ige was over 1400. Now I'm on fasenra and just started that. Went 2 years in between with nothing and got bad like before I started Xolair.(#5)I have been on Xolair for about 8 months, and I don't feel any different.  Good luck.(#6)[deleted](#7)I'm on Xolair for two years now. Was on a high dose prednisone for a year before, with multiple hospitalizations. My prednisone need decreased to around two times a year and I haven't been hospitalized since then. Still need my daily high dose Advair :) Took four months for me until Xolair kicked in.(#8)*copied from a previous post that I commented on* Xolair literally saved my life. I am 22F and have been on it since I was 15. I get 2 shots every 3 weeks. Its a literal godsend. I can now use shampoos and other beauty products that are actually good for my hair.  I used to have to pick products solely based on if the scent would trigger my allergies/asthma. I also have 2 cats now. (Im still allergic to cats but I adopted ones that don‚Äôt trigger me). My grades went up because I can actually breathe now. My asthma and allergies were so bad I was taking a nebulizer every morning and night, I had so much brain fog that I barely remember middle school because I was just constantly struggling to breathe. Xolair is the only reason I have been able to get my shit together. I graduate with a bachelors in a couple of months and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it without Xolair. I got new insurance this year and they are giving me a really hard time getting approval for Xolair so this is one of the few times I am off of it. Last dose was December 3rd and I was due on Christmas. Due to scheduling conflicts, I couldn‚Äôt get in till after the new year and now my insurance won‚Äôt approve me. Since going off of it, I can‚Äôt walk and talk without getting out of breath, I was having 12+ asthma attacks/day and now I am on 50mg of Prednisone/day just to function until i can get my insurance to cooperate. When I am on Xolair, I am still on the highest dose of advair and I tend to need my inhaler anywhere between 0 and 5 times a week depending on the weather. When it‚Äôs below 30¬∞ outside, I always need my inhaler from breathing in the cold air so that could be multiple times in one day but my asthma and allergies do bot get in the way of my life when I have Xolair. My dad is exactly the same way and it changed his life too. I hope it helps you like it helped us."

It took two days before I could notice a significant difference, but it will probably take weeks for it to reach full effect. Seretide works very well for me, so it will open up my lungs completely.

Life long asthma but rarely needed treatment until 20s. Now it in 30s and need treatment multiple times a day. Just developed thrush with an albuterol inhaler. Tips and tricks? Brushed this morning and the night before.,21,0.96,28,"(#1)Oral thrush is caused by your maintenance inhaler. (Steroid)

Regardless‚Ä¶ always gargle and rinse your mouth with water every time you use your inhaler. This will prevent thrush 

Oral thrush needs to be treated by a doctor. They will give you anti-fungal medicine. Go see an urgent care doctor or your PCP. It won‚Äôt go away on its own, and will only get worse.(#2)Rinse your mouth after using any inhaler. Wash the inhalers out periodically with soap and water. Get medication for the thrush.

Also antibiotics will often result in a case of Thrush..(#3)Albuterol doesn't cause thrush.(#4)Acv(#5)I gargle an obscene number of times to avoid this. I‚Äôve had it many times. Now that I gargle several times and brush my teeth and use mouth wash after I use my maintenance inhaler, I‚Äôm fine. Have to do it consistently though.(#6)Hey! I have Sjrogens. It causes dry mouth and eyes, amongst many other things. Due to that, I‚Äôm suuuper prone to thrush. I was diagnosed with asthma and started daily Flovent in early 2020 and really struggled with thrush. I eventually had nystatin (thrush medication) refills so I didn‚Äôt even have to see my doctor anymore. Here‚Äôs what has fixed it for me:

- first puff of inhaler
- gargle with fairly heavy salted water (taste the salt) for 30 seconds
- second puff of inhaler
- gargle the salt water again
- gargle with hydrogen peroxide for 30 seconds (two parts water, one part hydrogen peroxide)
- rinse mouth and gargle with water
- use tongue scraper 
- brush teeth 
- use mouth wash 

I‚Äôm not kidding. It‚Äôs a pain but so much better than thrush. This was recommended to me when I was on day 5099201 of thrush and posted on Reddit in desperation. One day a few months ago I decided to stop doing the hydrogen peroxide step and the thrush immediately came back.

Edit: formatting(#7)[deleted](#8)My doctor recommended that when I develop thrush, drink pure lemon juice. Worked wonders for me. Nowadays I just eat lemon slices.(#9)Just finished a five day treatment for thrush due to my newer inhaler. If you don't already have a tongue brush/scraper, get one. Then at the end of your treatment, scrape all that brown away and have yourself a nice gag-fest (haha)!(#10)Do you rinse your mouth out after you take your medicine(#11)You may want to start using a spacer, but yeah always rinse I too learned the hard way. That was a rough week in March 2020 when I thought I had covid, went in for an in person appointment because no one did tele medicine properly yet, was then exposed to someone with covid and sent a letter begging the docs to be more sensible about exposing asthmatics Glad telemed is so much easier now(#12)Rinse with plain water after every use of the maintenance inhaler, and ideally take it shortly before brushing your teeth and tongue.

If and when you get a gritty sensation on the back of your tongue, that's a common sign of a flare-up, so gargle deep with salty water several times a day, and ask your doctor for meds if needed. During flare-ups, try and have as little sugar as possible, from any source.

Unsweetened and unflavoured natural yogurt is your friend in this - mix some with water and gargle, as well as eating it frequently. The oral thrush seems to colonise areas where 'good' bacteria are diminished, so reinforcing their numbers is a good idea.(#13)You have to rinse your mouth after taking it"
"Asthma, steroids, and COVID?",12,1.0,18,"(#1)I‚Äôve had Covid and now have Long Covid. I have allergy induced asthma, previous to Covid was well controlled.

Prednisone helps for a very short time then it all comes back. I‚Äôm trying to get a pulmonologist appt, need a lung function test. I have two inhalers, maintenance and emergency, they don‚Äôt seem to help anymore. We tried singular, it was a no go due to bad side effects. All I want is to be able to breathe. I think Covid destroyed my lungs. Hope it gets better for you.(#2)Nebulizer helps a ton more than a fucking inhaler I‚Äôm telling you from 29 years of taking it‚Ä¶I got it from Amazon love it(#3)Might want  to look at some stronger control medication.My asthma was acting out of control after having covid.  It‚Äôs finally stabilized a year later and I‚Äôm going back on some medication.(#4)Definitely see the pulmonologist.  When I have a bad asthma attack and doesn't calm down, I have to start at 60mg prednisone for 4 days, then wean down every 4 days.. 50, 40, and so on. But woth covid I've heard it's tough. Another good hint to have to help keep your lungs open and recover is a nebulizer,  breathing treatments every 4 hrs until you start to breath linger without coughing.  Am on that too right now due to very bad flare up 4 weeks ago. It helps greatly so of you don't have a nebulizer ask your dr to start you up with one for the breathing treatments.  I buy my portable o es off Amazon and they're great and prices are very good. Hope you start feeling better rsoon and find some relief.(#5)I'm right there with you. Dealt with asthma when i was younger, but haven't used anything in the last 20 years. I got covid 2 months ago and have been dealing with shortness of breath almost daily. I'm on a corticosteroid now (qvar) and am waiting to get into a pulmonologist. Very frustrating as i used to run and work out regularly, but lately haven't really been able to. Hoping this clears up and things normalize. Good luck to you(#6)I‚Äôve had to take 15mgs of prednisone everyday for awhile now & still need to bump the dosage up when I get sick.(#7)Please try a nebulizer‚Ä¶.pretty much the same shit happened to me‚Ä¶past 5 months have been full of ER trips, even had to call an Ambulance‚Ä¶prednisone helps but only for short time, careful about taking it for too long though because my doc gave it to me for 20 days and my adrenal glands stopped working I had to be in bed for days‚Ä¶then I started my nebulizer salbutamol every 6 hours upto 4 x a day‚Ä¶that helped by the grace of God! Even now I have chest pains and shortness of breath and heart palpitations but no wheezing atm‚Ä¶I take singular, symbicort, spivira(#8)If your asthma is allergy induced you might want to discuss Xolair if you have an allergist(#9)Happened to me nearly 2 years ago when i got Covid early... 2 years later and i'm still on a daily maintenance dose of 5mg of Prednisone, although my lungs are back to normal, my  body has stopped producing enough cortisol so i'm having to be slowly weaned off.

I hadn't had any need for steroids in nearly 20 years, covid can suck a dick.(also if you're being put on long term maintance steroids, dont do what i did and eat everything...count your calories!)(#10)Yeah I had a full 3 months of shortness of breath and coughing due to a possible COVID infection back in October. Ironically I tested positive a week ago and my breathing is finally back to normal. I would definitely see the pulmonologist.

Need advice on a preventor?,7,1.0,14,"(#1)Is it a GERD (esophagus) issue or a breathing (lungs) issue? 

GERD can give symptoms of asthma. I ran into that problem when I was playing sports in high school. Albuterol and nebulizer won't stop the GERD. You'll need an antacid like Tums for instant relief or Nexium for longer term. There are some prescription pills you can get from your doctor too. 

If it is breathing issue the nebulizer was always my go to for serious issues.(#2)I‚Äôm taking Ventolin and Flovent.  Both do nothing for my SOB; nothing does. :((#3)You really need to be speaking to one or more qualified doctors. Even if people here are medical professionals, a practitioner needs to look at alot of information to determine the correct medicine. If Annie asthmatic here says well this medicine works great,; well it could have an undesiranle interaction with other meds. Don't ask here, go ask your doctor.(#4)You should see a doctor for them to do breathing tests on you & they can prescribe the appropriate medicine for your situation. If you have GERD, it can give you some asthma symptoms without actually having asthma, so treating that might be their first step to get you feeling better. If you need a controller inhaler or oral steroids, they can check all of your symptoms & go from there to get you on an appropriate inhaler/dosage for your symptoms & history.(#5)It took us around 20 years to figure out I had a hiatal hernia that was causing some of the what i thought was my asthma but was actually GERD symptoms. The pulmonologist eventually put me on Protonix but there are a hand full of other types of meds to treat GERD. 

Quick relief. Tums, pepto bismol, avoid spicy or highly acidic foods. Drinking water can help wash down and dilute the stomach acid. 
Longer term. Nexium or talk to your doctor and get put on something a little stronger(#6)Im on flovant i find it works well for me"
How do I find out I have asthma and how do I ease the symptoms?,2,1.0,9,"(#1)The docs will do some tests.

I was the same, everyone around me was like ""you're just unfit"". But you plateau with fitness, I was doing a twenty minute speedwalk to uni two to four times daily (stuff at home to sort) and I was still out of breath after doing it daily for two years. Took myself to doctors and they were like ""well your peak flow is fine but all your other symptoms say asthma so we'll try you with a rescue inhaler.""

Lo and behold rescue inhaler worked. Then they upped me to a steroid inhaler as it wasn't enough to ease the daily tight chestedness.

As someone who has health issues everyone else says I was overreacting to until I took myself to get tested and found I was right, stick up for yourself. Yes people can become a little bit of a hypochondriac at times, but you know your body, and tests will show whatever they need to show to clear up what's going on. There's multiple things that can cause asthma like symptoms (GERD, allergies, other underlying conditions). So wait till your insurance comes through and hang in there.


Things that worked for me:
- propping up my chest/neck/head at night with an extra pillow
- hot water bottle/microwaveable stuffie on my chest at night, mine's triggered by cold dry air so the heat would help,also turning off any AC
- more frequent vacuuming. Not accusing you of having a dirty apartment, but I find when I vacuum daily/every other day my symptoms ease
- wearing a scarf Everywhere. Yes even in the house, similar thing to the hot water bottle thing
- breathing exercises. Your lungs still have muscles supporting their function. It can feel goofy at first but breathing exercises will help build up some control for when you feel breathless. And I mean, consciously practice throughout the day. I'll be sitting at my work desk and suddenly remember ""oh hey I need to relearn to breathe"" and just do them while I'm working
- anxiety. This sort of ties in with the above. Take care of yourself. Get some mindfulness stuff in place as a lot of people on this sub seem to have some level of anxiety (understandable given breathing is important), but consciously doing breathing exercises so you autopilot them when anxious and unable to think will make it easier to recover your breath.(#2) immunologists or some doctors can perform several breathing tests on you(#3)If you do have asthma, your doctor would be able to proscribe you with an inhaler. Essentially this provides you with a temporary steroid boost to get you through asthma attacks. I‚Äôm not a doctor, just a dude with asthma(#4)Go to a physician, talk to them about it, get an official diagnosis, and then ask them for advice on how to properly treat. 

I wouldn't necessary wait until you have insurance to go. Especially if you are having immediate issues now. 

State you are a cash patient and ask for the cash rate. Use GoodRx for meds. 

Especially if you are going to end up with a HDHP you will end up spending money anyways, it's not like it will be completely covered with insurance.(#5)Of course it's always better to get a diagnosis before medicating, however if you are in the US, Primatene mist is available over the counter! I used it years ago and iirc it didn't work as well as Albuterol for me, but it's definitely better than nothing. I'm sorry your family isn't taking your health concerns seriously - that's really frustrating."
Anyone else experience these symptoms?,7,0.9,17,"(#1)Def use albuterol or similar first. After that however u wanna ground yourself is probably just fine.(#2)1st of all, i hope you have your asthma medicine/ inhaler (Albuterol) when in need.

But I feel ya, i do something kinda similar. For me, when i have shortness of breath from excessive physical activities (sport‚Äôs induces asthma) I usually got outside for fresh air. It clams me down and in 10-15 mins the asthma episode goes aways. This is the beat remedy i found to avoid been dependent on my inhalers. It took some time but glad found some way to avoid meds. Tired of taking them since childhood.(#3)You should try to control your breathing, not hyperventilate. Hyperventilating could make you pass out.(#4)I find myself tugging my earlobes, weirdly! Or sometimes twisting the hem of my shirt. It doesn't ""help,"" but it FEELS like it helps. I get that. Of course there are meds that need to be taken in moments like that, but I also find it helpful to do other grounding exercises like pointing out five things in the room that I see, describing each object, then moving on to four things that I hear. Things like that.(#5)do you panic when it happens ? i know with me i end up bending over and my hands are like on my knees and stuff and im basically gasping for air and every symptom in the book when its full blown"
Can you sleep off an asthma attack?,5,1.0,10,"(#1)Please call 911. Or go to the ER. You don‚Äôt want to die in your sleep because of an asthma attack.

Yes you can take up to 4 puffs of albuterol. If this doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶. Call 911

You may be ‚Äútired‚Äù because of the increased work of breathing and exhaustion that ensues(#2)My Dr's said you can take up to 4 hits on your inhaler at a time as it's about the same as using a Nebulizer(#3)And can do every 4 hrs...I had to go hospital for very bad asthma attack and because of covid couldn't use a Nebulizer at the time and so this is what the hospital Dr's had me do...4 huts on my escue inhaler, every 4 hrs. It works!!!(#4)I mean, asthma attacks last for some period of time, and you don't know time is passing when you're asleep, so *technically* yes. 

Lack of oxygen can cause you to feel tired though, so wouldn't if this isn't a typical level of asthma you are already familiar with.

As other people have mentioned, call a medical professional if you've exhausted your medical options. I also find taking a hit shower helps me, and if you're symptoms are severe sitting upright and putting your hands over your head increases lung capacity, which could help breathing.

If you have a history of taking Advil/aspirin and know that helps, you could also do that, but if you're not sure, for some people it can have to opposite effect.(#5)Not a good idea. If you're not sure what to do, call a nurse (if in the US, your insurance company should have one) or page your doctor.(#6)What happened did you get help? What others say is true, you may need oxygen. When I am struggling apart from taking my inhaler I sometimes take tums because the acid can trigger me, I get in the prone position (on tummy) and do some breathing exercises, I drink water to clear/thin any mucus and I sometimes take an antihistamine if allergies are setting me off - loratadine to avoid sleepiness‚Äôs This is based on counteracting my own triggers so yours may be diff. After a certain point I know I will need a some prednisone and maybe up my steroid maintenance dose so usually get urgent care help at that point. If rescue inhaler isn‚Äôt helping anymore it‚Äôs time for ER(#7)Ive done it lmfao but its scary cause i woke up every half an hour checking if i was alive lmao(#8)I wouldn't. Not worth the risk."
"During her latest concert, Billie Eilish noticed that a fan was having trouble breathing. So she stopped the entire concert of 20,000+ people ‚Äî all for one fan ‚Äî then told her crew to bring an inhaler.",73,0.96,2,"(#1)I love billie , she cares about her fans so much"
Not sure if asthma allergic reaction or viral infection,3,1.0,1,(#1)My asthma is triggered by irritants in the air and coughing gets worse when moving cos my lungs are struggling getting air. I recommend going to see a Dr or urgent care. Being that it's happening in public buildings to me it sounds like it could be irritants in the air from cleaning chemicals.
"I can't sleep. So I've been using a Nebulizer with Albuterol because my Mom told me to. But now, I feel heart pain and chest pain. I've been doing it for 4 days like twice a day.",15,0.91,28,"(#1)First things first: your heart is racing because of the meds, take deep breaths, put on some music you like; try to calm down a bit, your heart will slow down.
So: chest pain, is it permanent? Is there anyone around to take care of you if the situation gets worse? Tell someone how you feel please(#2)Your mom needs to take you to urgent care. You should not be using the neb that much.(#3)those symptoms can be from the nebulizer . completely normal(#4)Don‚Äôt let someone online diagnose you. You could go to a walk in and get some prednisone and get off the inhalers a bit. My personal experience was being prescribed Symbicort and albuterol. My doctor did not test me for food allergies or intolerances. My digestion was so bad that it exacerbated by asthma. Yes I get tested for Covid and have never been positive.(#5)Most relievers meds make your heart race. Happens to us all(#6)How r u doing op?(#7)I suffer with chronic asthma...for yrs...when I get bad I have to use my Nebulizer every 4 hrs as it keeps your airways open so you can cough out the mucus your lungs are producing from the asthma. If you don't clear that crud out of your lungs it will turn into an infection, this youbwill feel as pain in your lungs that doesn't seem to want to go away when you use your Nebulizer.  Your mom definitely needs to get you into urgent care asap!!!! And at night I have to sleep propped up on pillows otherwise the coughing gets worse because your lungs are struggling to get air. Hope you get to feeling better soon and get the right care you need.(#8)Also the wheezing is from the air trying to pass  thru your lungs cos the bronchial tube are restricted."
What's your experience with salt consumption in relation to asthma?,3,0.71,12,"(#1)2014 i had this crazy attack and every day for lunch and snack id have small pretzels along with ramen soup .(#2)I‚Äôm an outlier. I‚Äôve always been an extreme salt junky and haven‚Äôt noticed any impact on asthma.

Turns out I have ehler danlos syndrome and I‚Äôm SUPPOSED to eat tons of salt.(#3)All I know is that when I'm sick (usually asthma-related) I really want salt - soup, noodles, marmite on toast.(#4)Interesting. I‚Äôd never heard anything either way. I have low blood pressure so I don‚Äôt hold back on salt. Is the belief that salt worsens asthma or reduces it?(#5)I have poor digestion and don‚Äôt add it, no matter what kind. I notice it impacts my digestion and causes asthma agitation.(#6)Salt is more likely to impact your blood pressure than your asthma."
Pulse Oximetry and Racial Bias,0,0.5,26,"(#1)I'm not in the medical field but I'm White...like white white and I have asthma. I was in the ER this year for a major attack. Pulse ox was always up above 96% even when I was still gasping for air and they were considering intubation.  Dr decided to do a blood oxygen by taking blood from an artery.  When they took the blood the monitor read 98%. When the results came back it was  84%.(#2)Op it's not ""racist"" stop baiting.(#3)If your idea was even remotely true, people of color would be dying in droves in the hospital. Pulse oximeters work just fine on people of color.

I'm guessing that you don't realize that people of color have palms that are pinkish just like pale people. My neighbor is apoc and her fingertips are just as pink as my caucasian fingertips.(#4)Not a racial bias. Its more accurate the whiter and warmer your skin is. That is, its going to work better on an irish tourist in Egypt than a Brazilian tourist in Siberia. Medical equipment doesn't hold a racial bias.

I have never had it happen to me (I'm Morgan Freeman dark in the winter and darken in the summer) but I have read about the issue. The same thing sometimes happens in animal medicine. Dogs like Chows have dark tongues (where SPO2 goes) and we were taught to trust your gut during anesthesia for the same reason.  Personally i think you would have to create something that would retire the current technology. Clearly sensors have issues with melanin so you'd have to figure out a way around that."
Could I have asthma?,2,1.0,6,"(#1)There are lots of things that can mimic asthma. The most common being GERD/LPR/silent reflux.

Running on a treadmill is called a cardiac stress test and has nothing to do with asthma.(#2)Getting a PFT would make it pretty clear if you actually have asthma. It measures your breathing/lung volumes, while sitting. And you get ventolin puffs to see if you have any improvement.

My first PFT was normal but that doctor didn't take me off my puffers or singulair. Without my puffers my PFT was abnormal.(#3)Growing up there were a couple different PFTs. One with candles on a cake, another with a boring graph. Both were ultimately measuring lung capacity. A cheaper at home test, the peak flow, was used to see where you were after establishing a baseline. Green, good. Yellow, hit the inhaler. Red, nebulizer or ER.

Like they said earlier, the shortness of breath sensation could be a number of things from GERD, to anxiety, to asthma. Asthma will affect lung and oxygen intake. The GERD feels just like an asthma attack without the loss in air intake. Anxiety usually comes with some other symptoms beyond the breathing, I tend to associate it more with a increased pulse"
What meds to take for a cold that doesn‚Äôt make asthma worse?,2,0.75,17,"(#1)Mucinex DM (green packaging)(#2)Sudafed or Mucinex. The stuff you gotta ask the Pharmacist for.(#3)Sudafed (NOT phenylphedrine!), DM, guafenesin, nasal saline rinse, nose strips, multivitamin (esp need zinc), lots of hot steamy showers, lots of hot tea to loosen and calm things down, if possible elevate the head of your bed so you‚Äôre sleeping on slight incline 

That‚Äôs my basic stack. Not magic but it helps me a lot(#4)I take whatever I want. It doesn't affect my asthma. Most of the time, it's the cold itself that messes up my asthma. But, if you take something and it negatively affects you, look at the ingredients and be mindful because one of those did it.(#5)If you have acid reflux, several cold medicines are going to make it worse which in turn will make your asthma worse. Try an antihistamine and an acid reducer like Pepcid.(#6)For me it's anything except NyQuil/DayQuil. Something in that sent me to the ER with an asthma attack.(#7)Vitamin c(#8)tylenol(#9)So with me i find robatessin ( i cant spell ) would relieve the cough for like 5 min , and at night would cause worse flare ups . but buckleys really does help along with inhalers and other treatments(#10)[deleted]"
"Spouse waiting for maintenance‚Ä¶ in the meantime, getting bronchitis for the second time. Anything we can do besides urgent care?",3,1.0,9,(#1)Sounds like you need to go-to Urgent care or ER for a Prednisone course.(#2)You need to go to urgent care.
Calcilytics - what's the latest?,4,1.0,2,"(#1)I haven‚Äôt heard a thing. Sorry OP(#2)[https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/376/1/51.long](https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/376/1/51.long)

&#x200B;

This was the most recent review I found.  The TL;DR seems to be that the calcilytics of interest seem to be promising, between the established tolerance from previous trials and established effectiveness in mouse models on targeting airway hyperresponsiveness, but as far as I'm aware there's no trial utilizing them for asthma in humans."
"My asthma comes and goes with no obvious pattern, what are some asthma triggers to look out for?",19,0.95,22,"(#1)Look out for acid reflux/ GERD asthma. I went on for years without realizing that my asthma was cause by acid reflux, which creates the acids to inflame the respiratory ways and basically is the cause of asthma. And if this is the case, if you cure your gerd/reflux you'll cure your asthma. At, least that's my case.  check this article that talks about it. 

https://memorialhermann.org/services/conditions/reflux-related-adult-onset-asthma#:\~:text=GERD%20can%20cause%20asthma%2Dlike,trachea%2C%20triggering%20asthma%2Dlike%20symptoms(#2)Keep a food diary. Look for common ingredients in foods, like sulfur dioxide or potassium sorbate. Especially dried fruits.(#3)Also environmental triggers, like air quality, outside time, using your heating or cooling systems, etc. Air quality is a big thing for me. Going to see my dad who smokes and my mom who vapes is a big issue. My controller works pretty well but I always carry my inhaler when I visit.(#4)There's really a lot of different things that can trigger different people, so it could take some real investigation work. As well as food triggers, weather can have an impact - changes in air humidity, temperature, wind direction (which in turn can change pollen distribution). Thunderstorms have a reputation for setting a lot of people off because they cause sudden changes in all these things. This time of year spring tree pollen will be just starting to arrive in some places and whilst some people react to the big pollen types (such as birch) other people react more specifically to others (I react to several, I've had some years I've had hayfever from Feb to Sept).

If any sort of allergy might be in play, rather than trying to worry about what it is, you could try adding an antihistamine (or rather, probably try a few of them to see if you get one that works for you) and see if that helps.(#5)In addition to what the others said - psychology can also play a part. So make a note in your diary as to how stressed you are.(#6)Are you around smokers, people that vape strongly scented smells, perfumes, burning wood for fireplaces inside or out, any molds, mildew, pollen or pollution? A lot of times it‚Äôs things that you would not necessarily thing of as a trigger. It‚Äôs not always easy to figure out but the things I listed are all triggers for me.(#7)Dairy, milk products, always gets me no matter if it's even just traces. Found it when I had to go through an elimination diet. A few weeks later had some cheese and my asthma kicked off big time.

Food diary, write everything down you eat no matter how small, its a good way try and spot patterns.(#8)I learned early on that for me it was mold, pet dander, and spring allergies that brought it on. Spring sucked but at least I knew it was gonna pass eventually(#9)Are you on a steroid inhaler? If not, get on one. If so, talk to your doc because it sounds like you need to up your meds.(#10)Most likely allergies for you, random things in the air, pets, plants, fabrics etc(#11)Humidity (I check three times a day)  
Exercise intensity (If my heart rate goes too high, asthma attack)  
Gluten  
Diary  
Sugar (I have to rely on fruit bars and dip them in Green and Blacks raw coco powder for treats)  
Processed foods with junk in them  
Refined carbs (That includes 'health foods')(#12)Im like this as well but lately my symptoms have been more persistent(#13)Air quality, allergies, weather, perfume/cologne, exercise, stress, dust, smoking. All kinds of shit really"
Types of doctors I can get a Rx from?,7,0.9,9,"(#1)Some PCPs will start prescribing those if they're comfortable with it, and pretty much any I've ever known have no problems continuing prescriptions started by a specialist, especially if it's something you've been stable on for quite some time. Allergists/immunologists are also very good for that as that's usually part of their specialty(#2)Any doc up to and including urgent care and ER docs. I always get mine from my GP.

Discontinuing a long term maintenance med is not good without medical supervision. Get that renewed ASAP. You can do a med switch in a more organized fashion later on if you need to.(#3)My pcp just looked at the previous script from my pulmonologist and gave me a look over and listened to my lungs‚Ä¶ he gave me a rescue inhaler and a new thing. So yeah‚Ä¶ your pcp can usually prescribe that. Usually, but not always.(#4)All of the PCPs I have seen have been willing to prescribe inhalers and nebulizer vials for me. My nebulizer was prescribed by my former PCP too.(#5)Your gp should be able to write a prescription for you.(#6)Primary care or urgent care can usually give you a bridge prescription until you can get another specialist on board.(#7)Your PCP or allergist, hell, you can probably go to an urgent care and have them give you a 1 month script to tide you over.(#8)I've only ever seen an allergist or my PCP, lol. Any good PCP will continue previously prescribed medication until they have a damn good reason not to. You can use that time to settle in with a new pulm or allergist."
Perimenstrual Asthma?,8,0.84,7,"(#1)I have been researching this within the past year or so too! My asthma seems to flare up a few days to a week prior to my period starting. I thought it was pretty bizarre and that maybe it was coincidental the first few times it happened, but I guess it isn't so bizarre after all.(#2)it could potentially be related to histamines? estrogen increases during ovulation and right before the period starts, which causes increases in histamines during those times. had to get off birth control because all the estrogen was messing with my asthma (allergy-induced, if that makes a difference)(#3)Yeah I absolutely have this! Going on the mini-pill pretty much fixed it. From what I remember reading, it has something to do with your menstrual cycle being triggered by inflammation. Apparently estrogen helps to regulate inflammatory responses so either during ovulation or a few days before menstruation you can experience flares. 

If anyone else wants to be an absolute nerd about this, [this article](https://mrmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40248-016-0065-0) is probably the best info I‚Äôve found about it! They recommend going on birth control and skipping the placebo week.(#4)That's super interesting! Yes, I definitely experience that too but never thought there was an actual connection ü§Ø(#5)Yup always. Allergies, exercise. I got pretty mild asthma but damn..."

Cream,0,0.33,2,"(#1)Yeah.  Dairy and asthma don't play well together for some people.  This is a known thing, it's not just you.  You get a lot more phlegm and inflammation as a reaction to the dairy.(#2)If you're allergic to dairy, you will have a reaction to it."
Feeling like my lungs are shaking inside my body,2,0.75,8,"(#1)Are you sure it's your lungs?  How's your blood pressure?  Are you sure it's not your heart?

I ask because in the last few years I've developed intermittent atrial fibrillation that definitely intersects with my lungs in weird ways.  I can make my heart go haywire by taking in a really deep breath sometimes, and then it feels like my whole chest is rattling, like a car engine that isn't bolted to the frame or something.(#2)So do you do it when you clear your throat or do a cough? I have this odd ‚Äúshake‚Äù feeling when I do it, but thought maybe it was my stomach? Not sure, but if it‚Äôs what I do‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs definitely odd for sure.(#3)It's physically impossible for your lungs to shake."
Symbicort Blood Pressure,7,1.0,2,"(#1)I don't know that I have the timeline quite down,  but now that you mention it, my blood pressure was borderline high for years (and I was taking Symbicort). I went off it for other reasons and my blood pressure has been at better levels in the interim.(#2)This is something you should discuss with your doctor."
Air purifier?,4,1.0,1,"(#1)Damn, that's rough. Long term, you've got to make some changes.

HEPA is a standard, so it doesn't really matter which brand you get. You care about two things: 1. Volume of air it can move, and 2. Filter cost.

The cost of the original unit will be supplanted by the cost of filters pretty quick, so that's what you want to focus on. I've hald Holmes and a brand that's no longer being made. I imagine there are probably cheaper filters, but I buy them in bulk. You can also build your own with a fan, a box, and some weatherstrip if you find a particularly good deal on filters, but the initial unit cost is high."
Problems with starting an exercise routine and getting sick,12,0.94,16,"(#1)I swam almost daily for years, in an ozonated pool. Chlorine can be a‚Ä¶lung irritant. Some pools get heavy handed on using it. I stopped getting weird lung issues when i switched to an ozone purified pool. 

( which granted, may not be an option). 


Other than that, are you sure it‚Äôs a cold? Start slower, and balance it with dry-land exercise?(#2)We are in the exact same boat. Although, I used to run in hs. Anyway, I‚Äôve been going on suuuuuper long walks and it‚Äôs helped significantly. Also, going up and down the stairs is much easier now. I gotta turn up the heat with caution because my asthma is actually pretty bad. I‚Äôve heard good things about swimming. In particular, swimming isn‚Äôt too stressful and you get your exercise. The next best thing for you is to go on really long walks. I get up super early to walk with the old people at the mall. It‚Äôs air conditioned and you‚Äôre probably not gonna run into someone you know.(#3)If you are getting frequent colds, you may want to talk to your doc about it. The most common way of getting colds is touching your face after touching other things.(#4)I'm right there with you. I picked up running and every time I start to make progress I get hit with a sickness and lose all of it in a few weeks. It's disheartening to never get to a point where I'm happy with the results.(#5)I recommend seeing an Immunologist as they deal with all this...I just started seeing one, my pulmonologist referred me to him because my asthma is or has become complicated and they think there's an underlying cause. 
I started swimming again to help strengthen my lungs as it's the best exercise for them, but start slow.(#6)You can break out if this loop, you just have to keep going to a certain extent.

Obviously you need to stop exercising if you are ill, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you lose everything you gained in the two weeks before that. Once you are recovered, pick yourself up and start again. Yes, it might be a slight step back, but in particular cardio vascular fitness (and this is kinda the important one here) does not die off so quickly.

If you can increase your level of fitness then your asthma will not be as bad. I‚Äôm not saying you will be cured, in any way shape or form, I still require as much medication on a daily basis, but asthma‚Äôs ability to knock me sideways on a whim is a lot less. I feel a lot better day to day (physically and mentally!) too, it really is worth it.

Exercise may make you a lot more tired which might make you more prone to getting ill, but as others have said maybe look to your other habits if you are getting ill that often. That being said I am relatively convinced the warm wet atmosphere of swimming pools is a haven for germs, but‚Ä¶

Keep with it and build up slowly, you *will* see results eventually.(#7)oof yes I've experienced this too! I definitely don't have it figured out perfectly, but it's been recommended to me to start with low intensity exercise. I try to go for walks and slowly increase your distance. Additionally, stretching and easy yoga are great ways to take care of your muscles and add a bit of strength into the mix. I find that after I've been sick I basically have to ""start over"" and ease back in. 

Avoid that really intense stuff like HIIT, fast paced cardio, etc. At least for starters. Good luck!!(#8)Wow, I thought I was just getting unlucky with this! Every single time I start to work out, after about 2 or 3 months I get an illness. If I don‚Äôt work out for a few weeks I love heart and it takes me another 2 months to start exercising again‚Ä¶(#9)I would honestly try another activity other than a public pool. I would at least try it and remove the possibility that you are getting ill from the pool chemicals or just an unclean space because they don't use enough chemicals. 

Additionally, make sure you aren't over training. Working out too aggressively can lower immune response too. So just make sure you are easing in enough. Nothing wrong with hard workout sessions, but make sure they don't make up more than 20% of your weekly workout time (80/20 rule). 

Look up the correlation between getting sick often and training. Athletes that get sick a lot in training, it can be linked to poor training habits. 

I will also say, feel free to workout sick. Don't let that stop you. Obviously as long as you can breathe and feel well enough to workout, keep working out. Keeping active while sick can help with prevention of pneumonia."
Chemical taste/feel/smell,18,0.95,9,"(#1)Yes, I get that sometimes, for me it feels like the chemicals are stuck in my throat. I've switched to no ammonia/bleach and natural cleaners(#2)I've kinda experienced this. My biggest trigger happen to be petrol fumes, which I was around daily before. Ever since I started getting lung problems because of this (started as chemical pneumonia), I...have kind of felt an odd taste (if that makes sense) in my exhale, when I've been around this trigger. I dunno if my lungs are trapping the fumes or whatever, but it is definitely noticeable. If this is due to my lung problems, or just me imagining it from the stress it causes (I quickly lose breath from being around this particular trigger, which is also very stressful when people around me think it's fun to introduce that smell to ""see if it's actually a medical issue""), which I guess I could attribute the symptom to aswell.(#3)I bought a cleaning company about 6 months ago, my asthma was never this bad but I agree when I'm not wearing a kn95 or n95 I taste and feel the chemicals EVERYWHERE lol.(#4)This is nothing to do with mils asthma‚Ä¶ you have some other issues.(#5)Nothing that I have experienced(#6)This is not normal."

Sounds more like anxiety or a panic attack.(#2)No, it sounds like anxiety and if anything it‚Äôs probably because you unconsciously started breathing too fast and too shallow. Do some deep, slow breathing exercises (breathing all the way out on each breath) or therapy to treat the underlying anxiety, and it should get better.(#3)Asthma is in the lungs, not windpipe/airway.

It can be very anxiety-triggered and can cause asthma symptoms easily.(#7)doesnt sound like asthma, its prob some reflex your body is doing when your anxiety kicks in or adreneline.  you should still bring it up to your doc.(#8)For me, asthma is more like a tightness of the chest, wheezing and it hurts to take deep breaths in times of lung distress. Asthma attacks and flair-ups will last longer than just ten seconds and may even require an inhaler or nebulizer.  This just sounds like an anxiety attack and is also triggered by your coughing. I'm so sorry you had to go through that!"
Neighbor's smoke through air duct,20,0.95,8,"(#1)also the neighbor prob has no idea its reaching you.  i used to smoke, i would go on my patio and i was ground floor of a 2 story apartment complex.  my patio was not under the upstairs neighbors patio so i never thought about it really.  then one day i heard them shut a window while i was smoking and it turns out my smoke would go up and enter their dining room window.  After that i always looked and if the window was open I would walk out to the street to smoke.   if youre comfortable talking to the neighbor i would mention it...and not as asking them to stop just let them know(#2)Buy a HEPA air purifier with a uvc light in it! You might be doing them a favor by ratting them out!! Smoking is terrible!!(#3)You should approach your neighbor and let them know.(#4)Honeywell air purifiers are great. Take all the dust out of a room. Not too expensive on Walmart.(#5)HEPA filters are better than nothing. 

We use small fans on the floor to blow air back at doors and such where smoke comes in. 

Also consider talking to them and asking them to smoke outside or in rooms that aren‚Äôt as big a problem for you. Many smokers don‚Äôt realize how much of their smoke gets into other units, and are willing to smoke somewhere else when you tell them.(#6)i know they make some good filters for the air and heating systems......otherwise just invest in a nice air purifier for your home.  ive seen some higher priced ones thatll eliminate the odor of smoke as well.(#7)I created the awkward situation bc it‚Äôs my health. Thank god my neighbor was actually understanding and smokes in the parking lot. But like, if you live in a rough neighborhood then, idk if I recommend talking to the person."
do you get out of breath from house cleaning ?maybe from the dust or ?,4,0.83,5,"(#1)If you are getting out of breath doing simple tasks, it's time to talk to your doc about adjusting your meds.(#2)Do an experiment. Wear an N95 (or P100) mask while cleaning. How‚Äôs your breathing ? 

Then immediately go outside and take off the mask. How‚Äôs your breathing ? 

If you‚Äôre having trouble breathing because of the effort, talk to your doc about control. If you‚Äôre having trouble breathing because of dust or chemicals, talk to your doc about allergens.(#3)You could be allergic to dust(#4)If there is a lot of dust or I am vacuum cleaning I wear a respirator. FFP2/3. Helps a lot.(#5)If you cough or sneeze a lot it‚Äôs probably due to the dust"
Is there an antiperspirant deodorant in this world that won't set me off?!?!!,22,0.92,46,"(#1)Have you tried any roll on ones? I've found that the aerosol ones set my asthma off but not the roll ons(#2)We use vanicream deodorant (antiperspirant type) at home.  My husband doesn‚Äôt seem to have any problems with the performance, and I don‚Äôt get triggered.  I have pretty severe allergies to fragrances and chemicals that cause eczema and asthma.  Highly recommend!(#3)Mitchum has an unscented roll on that works pretty well. There are also several natural deodorants that are unscented or use essential oils (is EOs are better for you than fragrance), but natural deodorants can be hit or miss and can take a week or two to really figure out if it works or not. Some people have great success, some have zero success with natural deodorants. 

But IMO the Mitchum is really good. Secret unscented is also really effective but it is marketed more feminine, but I do think it would work really well for anyone. Eta: I am a very sweaty person and the Secret stops any and all sweat ridiculously well. The Mitchum does too but I find it to be drying to my skin so it gets itchy.(#4)If i dont use any and my arms start smelling, the smell of my arm pits makes me cough a lot. Is that weird?  (Yes my own odor)(#5)No pong works for me(#6)I read this as antidepressant deodorant and was super confused(#7)I‚Äôve been using Schmidt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ there are mens and womens types scents. Seems to work well for me. 

Anything with artificial fragrances gets me coughing, and the more natural ones don‚Äôt always do enough of a job. Finally found this one that seems pretty good.(#8)I have issues with stress and emotional sweat ü§¢(#9)Coconut oil mixed with baking soda, essential oils if you want a smell.(#10)My daughter uses vanicream. She had decided that no deodorant worked with her allergies, but I couldn't ride in the car with her without deodorant, so I told her to just pick the least bad one.

I missed my xolair this month and I'm reacting to my husband's deodorant. I think it's the alcohol. I'm hoping once I get my shot, it won't be a problem, but for now he's applying it in the bathroom and putting his undershirt on right away. Then he showers as soon as he gets home from work and doesn't reapply deodorant until the next morning(#11)Have you tried a salt stick deodorant? It‚Äôs literally a salt stick with no fragrance. You apply it directly after a shower when your arm pits are still wet. Then it dries. You do have to put a decent amount on (or that‚Äôs what it feels like to me when I take a bit to rub it on my underarms). It works pretty decently! My only issue with it at times is if I just freshly shaved and I apply it it can feel a little burny. And I do feel like it lasts about a day (if you apply enough) and then I definitely need to either freshen up or shower.(#12)Michem‚Äôs unfragranced.(#13)I buy roll ons(#14)You can try making your own. It's real simple. Look up a recipe. It'll be coconut oil and corn starch, or arrow root if you're sensitive to corn starch, you can also add shea butter, then you add a few drops of essential oil for scent, or none if you prefer.  

You can look up the recipe online.  There's no extra chemicals or fake scents to agitate your asthma.

And actually, this deodorant works better than any commercial one I've tried, and way better than any commercial natural one.(#15)Have you tried [crystal deodorant](https://www.naturadif.com/en/deodorants/174-henri-bernard-stick.html)? - while not an anti-perspirant I find it works quite well for odour.(#16)I once had a science teacher who said that antiperspirants are the dumbest thing ever. He said: ""You're basically taping your sweat glands shut to stop sweating. You might as well tape your butt shut so you stop pooping. Your body sweats for a reason !"""
Covid test negative but asthma acting up,3,0.71,17,(#1)The anxiety really doesn't help. I feel breathless + anxiety = more breathlessness + more anxiety. They sorta feed off each other and you need a circuit breaker. Maybe it's meds (ask your doctor) maybe it's routine.(#2)At home Rapid tests have a roughly 72% chance of detecting covid if you have symptoms. So if you take another test and it's negative then the chances of it being a head cold are high.(#3)I experienced the same thing. I thought I had Covid as well. I went to the doctor and had a PCR test and it was negative. It turned out to be my asthma acting up.  I had shortness of breath and mild tightness of chest as well as coughing. After a few days it got better.(#4)Are you testing every day? I had similar symptoms and had 2x negative tests but then tested positive üôÉ

Nebulizer advice for non-asthmatic,16,0.86,29,"(#1)I've had a couple different brands, they all seem ok. The only one that didn't work was a portable usb rechargeable generic one I ordered from Amazon.

The best plug in ones are the pari trek or omron but also require a HHN kit. Knew air compressors usually come with starter kits. At least the pari trek ones do.

Stay healthy!(#4)As a social worker can I please add, find a secondary person for those kids. Also make sure your will and wishes are written down. 

You need someone (God forbid) who can legally be responsible for them short term if you're ever in an accident/emergency etc.  If you are their legal guardian you need to make this part of your plans. Otherwise, you're right. They will go to CPS and if you are sick enough, you won't get them back. It's horrible to think about but if you don't, it make the situation so much worse for them.

Sorry to be a downer :/(#5)Pari Trek S is fantastic. No judgement. To each their own. Just be safe.(#6)Very important Note!!!! Do NOT buy mesh nebulizers for budesonide, as they don‚Äôt atomize the suspension appropriately. You must only use a jet-nebulizer(#7)I kept a Symbicort inhaler after my ins stopped covering it specifically for covid. I caught covid right before Christmas, and whipped that puppy out the same day my test came back positive. I don't know if it helped, but I can tell you my husband had to deal with a cough about 3 weeks longer than I did!(#8)I will add that if you have a CPAP machine‚Ä¶ well this old wheezy guy contacted COVID-19 in March of ‚Äò20. And rather than go to the hospital and get a bigger dose of virus, I hacked my machine and used it 24/7 until my Pulse Ox went high enough. I told my doctor about it a few months later and he facepalmed a bit, then laughed‚Ä¶.. he was a buddy in Engineering school who went for an MD a decade later, so he understood.(#9)I bought a DeVilbiss on ebay for $35 almost 10 years ago. You can probably still find those on there.(#10)OK guys. Reddit is saving me so much on tips/hacks for skin issues and cough issues.

I just ordered an sdom with saline vials.

Non smoker with GERD asthma and 4 year chronic cough that continuesd after 2 sinus surgeries.(#11)Any table tops model that costs at $40+ should be fine.  More expensive ones are generally faster, but if this is only for a true emergency you should be good with a cheaper model.  I would avoid battery powered at this price point.(#12)I bought one at CVS years ago for my son for like $30 and it has worked well.  Just an FYI, they also sell oxygen cans at Walgreens.  You may want to look into getting a couple of those just in case.(#13)I forget the brand of mine but it was only $20. 

On a side note, I caught Covid a week ago and have asthma. My symptoms presented just like the flu and my sense of taste and smell never went away. I am vaccinated which I think is why I didn‚Äôt feel worse.(#14)Someone on here actually posted a pic of their nebulizer , after having issues with my asthma i bought the same one incase of another flare up . sdom"
Prednisone side effects?,14,0.94,38,"(#1)I have been dealing with chronic asthma & have a love hate relationship with prednisone...it dries my lungs up but the side effects are horrible, I always have to go on high doses. Every time I go on prednisone I get fluid build up on my spine and get back pain, same spot every time. Prednisone does make you retain fluid and it can cause pain in many areas of your body. I take ibuprofen when my back gets back as it helps to relieve the pressure.  One of the best things I've found to help me when on this stuff is eating foods high in potassium...Google this and will help you get thru your prednisone times.(#2)I haven‚Äôt experienced that, but I had lots of irritability, fast heart rate last time I had to take it. Stopped after day 3, couldn‚Äôt take it anymore but thankfully it was enough to stabilize my asthma.
I was also taking albuterol and Breo(#3)Only one I‚Äôve ever experienced is weight gain. It‚Äôs annoying. This doesn‚Äôt sound like a prednisone issue so much as a spinal issue.(#4)With Prednisone my main side effect is hunger and if I'm on them too long I'll get the bad mood changes.(#5)I‚Äôve never experienced that, but I do tend to get joint pains when I‚Äôm on Pred, especially in my wrists. It literally feels like my bones hurt üò©(#6)Anger (with alcohol) and weight gain(#7)I'm on long term inhaled but have been on/off the tabs for \~40 years.

It increases my appetite (a good thing because I'm underweight), increases my activity and doubles down on my short temperedness. I get very snappy and have to remain vigilant of this ('roid rage).

I've never noticed any joint/back pain but am aware that some of the big doses I sometimes need do require a very long drawn out decrease.(#8)Weight gain was all I had. Was hospitalized when I was 10. Full month of it. Gained 30 pounds in 30 days. Never was skinny again lol(#9)I've only been on Prednisone briefly, because I'm a diabetic, and prednisone raises my blood sugar to incredible heights that do not respond to insulin. So as a general rule I avoid steroids, but there are some times when that's the only way to breathe comfortably.(#10)I get horrible headaches and neck pain. My son does as well. He did some research online about the side effects. Turns out that methyl predisolone which is essentially the same drug doesn‚Äôt cause the back and neck pain. I can tolerate it. It still causes all the other side effects like mood swings, agitation and insomnia but I can deal with that because I start feeling better right away. I‚Äôve had pneumonia twice and Covid once and I think the steroids are the most effective drugs in the treatment.(#11)I've experienced pounding heart beats in my ear while trying to sleep.  I hate steroids.(#12)[deleted](#13)I get that exact feeling, like an electrical shock running up and down my spine. I'll usually have it for a while after I'm done with the prednisone, too.

My back and neck are usually pretty stiff, but I can move more easily while I'm on prednisone, so I've wondered if maybe I've got some sort of spine damage, but usually I'm too stiff to move in a way that triggers the pain zap.(#14)When I‚Äôm on prednisone I get insomnia, and lose my appetite. Oh, and I‚Äôve been on it twice and it didn‚Äôt actually give any of the intended benefits either time, so that was fun.(#15)My doctor refused to prescribe me prednisone he said it does real damage to your kidneys so I‚Äôve stayed away since.(#16)A while ago I took predneselone which is similar and nothing really occurred for mine(#17)Just wanted to echo the idea that not may be electrolyte imbalance from the steroids causing the weirdness. I used to take them whenever I got a chest cold or severe asthma attack, then in 2018 I was given a steroid shot for a bad sinus infection, and nearly died. I woke up in a state of paralysis, unable to move anything but my head and hands. I was rushed to the ER and because of negligence was left lying (even fell out of the bed) for 4 hours before anyone bothered to check my blood. It turns out the prednisone bottomed my potassium to 1.6, a few banana bags/pills later I was up and walking. Since then, I will not even use hydrocortisone cream lol be careful, and stay hydrated, some pedialyte might relieve some of your symptoms.(#18)I‚Äôve experienced joint pain, intense itching/burning on hands and feet, desperate hunger, weight gain/puffiness, insomnia, hot flashes, and anger. Those were all much worse when I was a kid when I was on prednisone more often than not.(#19)I‚Äôve been on 15mgs of prednisone a day for the longest time. I‚Äôve noticed that I do get roid rage & crazy weight gain.(#20)Prednisone is both an amazing drug and a horrible drug at the same time.  It definitely works and clears up lung issues for me almost instantly... but I hate the feeling I get on it.

I don't get back pain, but I get crazy head aches.  My face is like an olive oil press then turns into a pizza.  Like the greasiest thing in the world.  My appetite is insane... like insatiable.  I'm constantly full and starving, and my face is turning into a circle.  And while I fall asleep fine, I end up waking up around 4am and can't fall back to sleep for the life of me.  I also get rapid heart beat sometimes, and notice kind of a short fuse with my wife/son... and that just makes you feel crazy and not yourself.  Thankfully I have one day left on my current cycle and I can't wait to clear this stuff from my system.(#21)My worst side effects are cataracts and osteoporosis.(#22)I‚Äôve been on it for two weeks and am tapering down from 100mg, currently at 60mg.

My knee and hip joints are really painful and I‚Äôm starving. I eat every 3 hours.

But I‚Äôm not dead and can breathe üòÇ(#23)Prednisone is cortisol. I would only take it in emergencies. 

Look up the side effects to get a full list but it can cause elevated HR, anxiety, poor mood, high blood pressure, hunger (it screws with your insulin), and others. 
You also get a tolerance for it every time you use it requiring higher and higher doses. 

Only go for it if absoluteky necessary."
Out of breath when talking,4,0.84,5,"(#1)You could talk to your doctor about it, maybe they can help(#2)I‚Äôm a community college teacher. The only thing worse than talking/singing for my exercise induced asthma is jogging. And masks make it harder. For me the first sign that I‚Äôm going into a longer asthma exacerbation (usually triggered by seasonal weather or allergens) is that I get out of breath teaching. If you have a controller you only use sometimes, now is the time to start it (well, a week or two ago would have been better, but now is all you can do). Otherwise, see your doctor and discuss changing controllers or adding another one. 

Also, if you aren‚Äôt already using your rescue inhaler when you experience this, do so.

Edit: typo(#3)Masks do thos to me , especially if im already struggling. I hate them with a passion. Have you tried an unmask if you are wearing one when this happens or switching controllers?(#4)It sounds like it's time to get your meds adjusted. Symbicort may not be the correct med for you."

is zempreon different to ventolin and asmol ?,1,1.0,1,"(#1)That's a very good question, but given that the name of the game is 'Profit Before People', you more than likely won't get a truthful answer from either your quack or local chemist.

I would simply tell the chemist about the effect zempreon seems to be having on you and that you want either Ventolin or Asmol - and tell your quack that you don't appreciate him/her/it pushing something different when what you were using was working perfectly fine.

Believe me, not one of them cares a fig about you, me or anyone else - only profiting from the misery and sickness they can get away with prolonging for their own financial gain."
Help with understanding peak flow?,2,1.0,5,"(#1)I‚Äôm an A&E nurse and I see teenagers often come in with asthma attacks and their peak flow is around 200-250. Normal is usually 400-700. I personally reach about 650 on average. You should probably ring NHS 111 for some advice. Does she have a productive cough? Bringing up phlegm? What colour is it etc. If she has finished a course of steroids and still has that peak flow. She may need more steroids or some antibiotics if it‚Äôs caused by infection and maybe a chest X-ray. I hope you get sorted!(#2)Normal for that age and height should be around 400, varies widely depending on age, gender and height.  Im a 5‚Äô10 28 year old male and my normal is around 700-760. Which is a little higher than the average for my age/height/gender(#3)I hope she is doing better the same thing happen to me but I did grow up with asthma but went away in my teenage years I‚Äôm almost 22 my peak flow is usually 550 but recently it‚Äôs been dropping almost to 300 it‚Äôs been like this for month since it started and a month and week since I got Covid( I didint have Covid by the 5th day to, I was perscribed prednisone and albuteral, Flovent and amoxicillin flow vent was perscibed 2 days ago and I‚Äôm starting to feel better my peak flow reached a max of 621 today my highest ever, Ik some people that been dealing with it for months now, Covid is weird and it can give long lasting consequences.

Gerd sounds like a major possibility in my opinion, but I‚Äôm no dr. Most people don‚Äôt realize that gerd isn‚Äôt just heartburn, but you can actually inhale your refluxed stomach acid in your sleep into your lungs ... or even water or food or whatever‚Äôs in your stomach... and it makes your lungs swollen and inflamed.

Need advice on air cleaners/purifiers,6,0.88,9,"(#1)I researched on Consumer reports to find good recommendations for air filters. There are so many different kinds. Ones I was looking at were not in my local stores. I ended up buying two Homedics HEPA air filter machines at Costco. One I put on the family room and one in my bedroom. I really noticed less itchy eyes in the family room. We have a fluffy cat and an Aussie/Heeler mix. I could vacuum more often and keep on top of dust better, but I think the air cleaners have helped. No pets sleep with us. I have seen advertisements for wipes for pets to help with allergies. Baths for pets also help.(#2)The one I have is Austin Air Healthmate Plus. I got it because I'm allergic to the smoke from fireworks and I spend several weeks in December and July coughing up blood because my neighbors set off so many fireworks. It helps, this December I didn't have to take Prednisone.(#3)Honestly slapping a HEPA filter on a boxfan was the best thing i did out of the pandemic.
It‚Äôs cheaper and works great, one down side‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ugly, Real ugly‚Ä¶(#4)I‚Äôve used the same Idylis air purifier (Hepa and Charcoal filter) for my daughter since 2019. She is 10 now and her sleeping habits are drastically different if we forget to turn it on. We have a dog but the dog rarely comes in her room. I run it one high only when changing linens and vacuuming to help grab the allergens. Otherwise it is on low. It is considerably quiet when on low. I feel that the air purifier makes a difference for her.(#5)Think any with a HEPA filter will probably do just make sure it's powerful enough for the room you use it in. Think mine as helped. My breathing at night definitely seems better."
Need inhaler no insurance,17,0.91,57,"(#1)I have no insurance and I got a prescription filled for an inhaler from a pharmacy using Good RX for $22(#2)My allergy doctor and pulmonologist always have samples at their office. Might be worth a call to your doctor to explain the situation and ask for a sample.(#3)ER is a bad choice. It‚Äôll be a $2k inhaler. 

Why can you not just do a refil and use Good Rx?

If you need a new script go to a PCP and pay cash and then fill the script. Cash visits are usually inexpensive. I could get one for $50 but you have to have an established physician. A new Pt appt is more expensive but necessary if you need it.(#4)I‚Äôve heard of things like GoodRx that can be very helpful. Not free, but it‚Äôs significantly cheaper than it would be normally and sometimes even cheaper than it would‚Äôve been with insurance.(#5)Buy a plane ticket and come to Australia üá¶üá∫!

Feel free to PM me. I posted about it a while ago.

In the meantime, yes Primatene mist is $27, OTC and you don‚Äôt need to visit a Dr.(#9)sometimes drug stores will have otc inhalers but it‚Äôs epinephrine most of the time(#10)Over going to the ER, I would do a telehealth visit like Amwell. They cost $75 with no insurance. Explain your situation to them and they will write you a prescription. As mentioned, you can get an albuterol inhaler for around $20. As a long term solution, I would search for low income clinics in your area if you need a maintenance inhaler. Good luck!(#11)[inhousepharmacy.vu](https://inhousepharmacy.vu) This website is a fucking godsend. They send you inhalers for cheap WITHOUT ANY PRESCRIPTION NEEDED.

I have an extra one maybe I could send it to you?(#17)> Is there an over the counter solution?

I used to use Primatine Mist. That way there is no co-pay to go see a doc also.(#18)I‚Äôve been in this situation in the past. I ended up getting a new one for $100 no insurance.(#19)There's an app called SOS-Asthma for users to lend/borrow inhalers during emergencies. Coverage isn't great and is highly location dependent, so I wouldn't rely on it but it's nice to have it as backup. I always recommend my friends with asthma sign up for it because the more people on it, the more likely there is to be an inhaler available when you forget/lose yours.(#20)In the same boat, I've been using the Primatene OTC inhaler. It sucks (makes my mouth feel bad and tastes bad) but it works. It's also like $30 which majorly sucks.(#21)I‚Äôm showing my age a little on this reply, but many, many years ago I was able to buy Pimatene Mist over the counter without a prescription. It‚Äôs available on Amazon now in the US for ~$28. It‚Äôs similar to albuterol (a prescription rescue inhaler.(#22)u/Delicatebody  OP if you are in USA, you can try walgreens who carried over the counter inhaler Primatene (Mist Epinephrine aerosol).

"Dad doesn't think I have asthma despite diagnosis, and it's getting worse....",15,0.94,10,"(#1)Tell your doctor. Explain the situation and tell them you need help talking to your dad. Maybe you should make an appointment where both you and your dad can talk to the doctor about the diagnosis, risks, and your father's concerns.(#2)My parents have been very similar with my health issues, including my asthma and cptsd. 

To start: if you can't get your hands on your inhaler (if you have the money and access, you \*can\* go pick it up yourself - my parents started having me sign for and buy my meds when I was like 7), you can try some alternatives. I went a long way before my official asthma diagnosis controlling it with caffeine and benadryl. You can also do what you can to avoid your triggers, depending on what they are - wear a scarf or a balaclava when you go in the cold, stay away from chemicals that bother you, and keep exercise to what's manageable. I do a lot of walking and hiking because more rigorous exercise is hard on my lungs - something that was true at 150lbs and at 220lbs, because exercise can only help so much.

Since you said you have cptsd, if you're in therapy, you should definitely talk to your therapist about this. CPTSD can affect asthma (you can end up in a spiral of anxiety and asthma attacks that build off each other), so working on controlling your anxiety and hyperarousal symptoms (anxiety, anger, unusually high activity levels, etc) can help. You can do this with grounding, meditation, and breathing exercises, as well as techniques like DBT and CBT. They also might be able to help you more directly with your situation with your dad. 

fwiw, it might be worth it to acknowledge that your dad has legitimate concerns - my pysch nurse straight up admitted that she knew I didn't need anti-depressants or mood stabilizers for my cptsd, and instead misdiagnosed me with bipolar disorder to justify them. When I called her on it, she asked if she could prescribe me sleeping pills just so she'd have something to give me. On the other side of things, my inhaler makes me shaky and anxious, and can be really triggering for my cptsd. It's only been by getting off my psych meds, making lifestyle changes to reduce my interaction with asthma triggers, and attending therapy that I've seen improvement all around. Not saying this is you - lots of people \*do\* need anti-depressants for cptsd and aren't in a position to eliminate most asthma triggers from their life - but I think it's important to acknowledge that his fears have a real foundation, even if that foundation isn't actually applicable to you.

You should also talk to your doctor who prescribed your inhaler about both your dad and your symptoms. I haven't technically been ""officially"" diagnosed (I'm still waiting on a PFT which was delayed due to covid), but my doctor told me that if I was taking my rescue inhaler more than a couple times a week or if I didn't feel like it was helping, she would need to prescribe me something stronger/more regular. If your symptoms are severe enough that you feel like they could become life threatening, it sounds like a rescue inhaler might not be enough.

If it helps, it might be worth it to show him some statistics on [asthma treatment and deaths](https://www.aafa.org/asthma-facts/). (TW talk of dying) >!The number of people with asthma globally is increasing, and in the US alone \~10 people die of asthma each day - deaths that could be avoided with proper treatment and management. It might help to make it clear to him that a rescue inhaler can be the last resort before a trip to the ER, and that it could genuinely be the difference between life and death. !<The goal can still be to reduce your overall need for the inhaler, but having it means you have a safe option if things go sideways.(#3)I guess the next step is who else is in your family or community that could help your dad understand? Anyone who would advocate for you? 

Alternatively, can you call up your doctor yourself and ask for their help? 

Or, can you talk to a school nurse? 

I‚Äôm assuming here, forgive me, but there is often a cultural translation piece that needs to happen, that is often missing in medicine.(#4)I second asking your doctor to help explain it to your dad. You shouldn't mess around with asthma. If you can get to the pharmacy through other means, try to get your inhaler without him. Friends or other family members maybe. 

But get your doctor to help explain that this is really dangerous to mess around with. He may as well be withholding an epipen.(#5)If you are in school tel the school nurse.(#6)Call your doctor or talk to a school nurse, counselor, or teacher. 

Be aware that this can be considered child abuse (specifically, medical neglect).(#7)exercise definitely helps. When I was younger and skateboarding I rarely ever needed my inhalers. And I completely stopped using my once a day preventative. I'm not sure if I was prescribed Symbicort back then or prednisone. But I basically didn't need any medicine. Every one is different though, but maybe if you can talk you dad in to getting the inhaler if you start some light exercise to build up your lung health. It's not necessarily about losing weight, it's about breathing easier. cardio is the way to go. just go for a walk before or after dinner every night. then eventually you'll notice you can breath easier and walk farther. But you'll need something to help until your lungs can handle it on their own.

edit: also you can buy primetime mist without a prescription. it is OTC so you have to ask the pharmacist for it. Not sure the situation, maybe you can pay for the primetime mist instead of your dad buying the albuterol. I've used it when I didn't have insurance, it is like 10-12 bucks. As far as I can tell there is no age limit, if that is a issue."
How many candles would you need to play this game? 3? 4?,92,0.99,21,"(#1)Would taking Albuterol before doing this be considered cheating?(#2)When I go to my asthma doc and they test my breathing, the test is trying to blow out virtual candles on a laptop screen.(#3)What are your peak flows?

How do I know when my rescue inhaler is out?,4,1.0,13,"(#1)It feels much, much lighter and you can physically feel that it is spraying less. Also, if it is completely out,  it doesn't do anything lol

Definitely get a backup inhaler if you can until you get accustomed to how to tell when an inhaler is running low!(#2)Put the canister in a cup of water, if it floats at the top it's pretty empty.(#3)Give it a shake, you can feel the medicine inside(#4)You can generally tell by how the canister feels and sounds when you're shaking it. If it seems like there's not much more liquid left sloshing around while priming, put that refill order in with the pharmacy.(#5)Shake it. Can you feel the content of the canister? If not, then it's either out or almost out.(#6)I usually get about 15-20 more puffs after zero.(#7)Are you on a controller med? This will make a huge difference with exercise.

Mild asthma but only acts up certain times. Anyone in Massachusetts having slight breathing issues? The lady few days ugh,2,1.0,0,
What do you do when you‚Äôve ran out of an inhaler?,11,0.92,44,"(#1)Hi UK asthma sufferer here, when i ran out i went to the pharmacy where i get my meds from and told
them the situation and gave me a emergency as mine was on order(#2)I refill it and pay for it. Your health and life is a priority like food water and shelter. 

Try Good Rx if you don‚Äôt have insurance.(#3)Steam is probably the best thing you can do without an inhaler.  Head over a bowl of hot water with a towel over your head to keep the steam in. Breath normally for a few minutes. 

For anyone in the UK I'd advise look at if the prescription pre payment certificate works out cheaper. It's not going to help right now but worth looking at as it will probably save you money long-term if you need more than one thing a month.
 https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs/prescription-prepayment-certificates-ppcs(#4)Coffee and naps. Which are kind of incompatible..(#5)Vics vapor rub and minty gum or candy works for me.. at one point I truly couldn‚Äôt afford and those items worked for me(#6)Magnesium. Pills, topical, whatever. I mix mine with dmso. You don't have to do that. It relaxed the airways.(#7)Have you tried Zinc? It has worked wonders for me. 50mg per day for a couple weeks, then you can drop it to 20-30 or as needed. I take zinc citrate,  but other forms may work just as well. It might take several days before you see any benefits.(#8)Hot coffee will help but please buy an inhaler. Nothing is more important than breathing.(#9)Ah I  didn't realise you had that situation in England.  As all prescriptions are free in Scotland I've never had to consider costs of asthma medication.(#10)Do you know how much it cost?(#11)Do you have a family doctor? When I was between insurances, my doctor knew how expensive my meds were so she gave me a sample for free. It helped for a month until I could get the new insurance and then prescription filled.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a free sample (or even discounted).(#12)My doc also gives me meds sometimes bc insurances can be real assholes.(#13)Preventative inhaler (ex. steroid) or relief inhaler (ex. Albuterol)?(#14)How much does it cost in UK?(#15)I never run out cuz I get a bunch at every hospital visit so I‚Äôm set for months at a time"
Is rescue inhaler what I need?,1,1.0,6,"(#1)At this point it doesn't sound like you would need a preventative since you only flare up when sick. The side effects of some of the daily  steroid inhalers would prob be worse for you than dealing with one or 2 flare ups a year.(#2)I'm the same. Just use when needed. Especially of you exercise. I know stress and emotions get me as well as my period,weather hay fever, food allergies, Etc. It's mild but I've been having problems a few days because of the weather changes.(#3)You should not be using a rescue inhaler on a daily basis. If you need something on a daily basis, your doctor should prescribe a controller med."
Looking for recommendations!,8,1.0,24,"(#1)I have moderate, controlled asthma and I had covid the first week of the year. Fortunately it was a very mild case and I had hardly any lung related symptoms. I've been on Symbicort daily for years and I personally believe that helped reduce my symptoms. I drank lots of water, took my vitamins, and had lots of sleep!(#2)Good news is, if you are on regular inhaler preventatives, you are already a step ahead of regular folks when it comes to Covid medications from what I hear.

Good reason to remember to keep up with preventative meds right now! :) (Something I struggle with...)(#3)I'm really glad this thread exists.  I've been taking the pandemic VERY seriously on account of my asthma (also obesity and high blood pressure, which I imagine aren't uncommon for severe asthmatics), and it's really interesting and reassuring to hear asthmatics talk about their experiences with Covid.(#4)Do you have a nebulizer? That always helps with bad asthma attacks for me & im currently taking advair which is a preventative low steroid inhaler!(#5)What were your symptoms ? i might have covid and im freaking out rn(#6)I have moderate, controlled asthma. I just had Covid few weeks ago and still suffering from asthma attacks regularly. My coughing was so bad until vomiting, chest pain & upper back pain. I went to er on my fourth day because of those symptoms, they ended up prescribed me cough medicine could be used together with my rescue puffer because at that time, I already maxed out the puffs allowed for a day. Also during those times, my Dr. Suggusted to use 4 puffs instead of 2. 
I‚Äôm triple vac, on con 

So i think you should monitor your symptoms, if It getting worse, seek for emergency immediately. And talk to your family doctor if your asthma gets worse. 

I(#7)Try the wim hof method, and oxygen advantage, combining those 2 things helps a ton, for me ar least"
Possible asthma? Asking here because I can‚Äôt get a doctor‚Äôs appointment atm,5,0.86,5,"(#1)The symptoms when prone sound like GERD/reflux.

Asthma does not cause itching or red flaky spots.

Shortness of breath and elevated heartrate when walking fast would be more indicative of being out of shape if you don't engage in a regular exercise program.(#2)Do you have heart problems? Does it get better if you  raise your arms above your head? Does it go away with rest?"
Recurring chest congestion,2,1.0,5,"(#1)Asthma would not cause you to cough up green blobs. You may susceptible to recurrent sinus infections. I was constantly getting sinus infections and an ENT figured out I had a deviated septum and damage to some of the sinuses. It took 2 surgeries to get things straightened out but I haven't had a sinus infection in almost 20 years.(#2)I had the same issue but it was my ENT who told me how to solve it! I get mild allergies and my nasal passages get swollen so mucus stays there, gets infected, then the infection eventually reaches my lungs and I get a horrible cough which turns into bronchitis that could last for months without antibiotics.

Her solution was to irrigate my nose with NeilMed twice a day when it gets stuffy and use a corticosteroid (flonase) to reduce the inflammation. Every time seasons change I also use zyrtec and montelukast to prevent allergies.

Maybe you could bring this up with your Dr and see if your issue is similar to mine. 

Hope this helps(#3)I was getting repeating infections. Turns out it's down the Excessive dynamic airway collapse. Basically because I can't breathe out properly the mucous doesn't get cleared from my lungs. Which then causes it to get infected and causes my asthma to get worse. Definitely worth mentioning to the specialist and getting some lung function tests."
Diagnosed with moderate uncontrolled asthma,4,1.0,5,(#1)Allergy meds are just as important as asthma meds.(#2)Are you taking an allergy med like Claritin/Allegra/Zyrtec to control your allergies?
How does alcohol affect you?,10,0.92,17,"(#1)I‚Äôm fine in general with alcohol, but for some reason red wine often triggers my asthma. Not a crazy amount but I do get wheezy.(#2)I used to drink a lot when I was younger without any issues at all. Now idk if it's due to my Hep C or being asian/older but I can't drink at all anymore. Just makes me feel overall crappy and I can't breathe. Feels different than another asthma  attack like I can't empty my lungs or take a breath. Nebulizer nor an inhaler helps so I just stopped drinking entirely.(#3)I sometimes have trouble with wine and wheat beers and avoid cedar-aged beverages due to allergies. A full tummy in general can create some extra problems for me if there‚Äôs internal jostling for space in my chest and abdomen. Asthma is weird and annoying to say the least.(#4)Regular liquor does not affect me, but a wine cooler or regular wine can put me in the hospital because of the sulfites(#5)I noticed that alcohol and heavy meals can trigger it probably due to gerd- I find I can tamp down problems with a few tums.(#6)Can't have it. I feel generally unwell very quickly and it makes me feel tight. I also worry if I've had alcohol and then needed help, it would cause problems. I also have ADD and Aspergers so that's enough without alcohol making it worse aha.

I did have an asthma attack on a night out and the security personnel there just kept insisting I was ""obviously drunk"" and kept trying to force water on me until someone got my best friend out who set the record straight and helped me with my asthma - that's pretty much sealed it for me so I don't drink at all, just so when my friends are asked ""how much has he had?"", they don't have to guess, they just KNOW it's none.(#7)Heck yes . i get anxious when i drink so that would flare up my asthma lmao(#8)I haven't noticed a correlation.(#9)Zero correlation between the two.(#10)I found out that I was allergic to sulfites pretty early on in my drinking life. Really, really sucks.(#11)It doesn‚Äôt affect my asthma at all.(#12)For me, wine often increases mucus production and mild breathing issues.(#13)Alcohol was the trigger that made me realize I had asthma in my early twenties. tightness and shortness of breath, wheezing, etc. Happened with hard cider and a bottled margarita, i think it‚Äôs connected to allergies for me though."
Adult-Onset Asthma Associated With E-Cigarette Use,0,0.5,0,
Gaslit by A&E Doctor Whilst Having COVID,6,0.88,15,"(#1)I get gaslit all the time and I'm a middle aged, married women. Not just with asthma too. Last month I broke my ankle and the ER doc was going to send me home without an xray because it was highly unlikely I broke it she said, although, I couldn't bear any weight at all. Xrays came back and yes broken. Then they were not going to cast it because it wasn't bad but did because they didn't want orthopedic to yell at them. Guess what? I'm in my 5th week of a cast. Orthopedic said it was essential, even a boot wasn't good enough.Just stick to your guns, only you know how you are feeling.(#2)Pleurisy is freakin painful.  I had a bout of it when I was about 22 and was in so much pain.  It may be the pain is more tolerable for some when they are younger but it always caused me pain.  Sorry to hear you are dealing with it.  Grab a pillow to hold to you when you breathe or lean over.  Sounds silly but it helps.  
  Did the doc say what they thought might be the cause of the pleurisy?  Typically it happens with respiratory infections.  Covid can cause pleurisy.
Did they mention if you had effusion or empeyemas?
That is kinda important.  I can see how they may not want to drain unless absolutely necessary but they should let you know.  If one ruptures you might suddenly feel much better but be in danger.
Do you have anyone you can follow up with?
Not that guy obviously, maybe a PCP.(#3)No I‚Äôve never gotten anything like that. I‚Äôve always been taken very seriously. People around me just constantly think I‚Äôm on the verge of death and are very nice even when even I‚Äôm having symptoms and being a dick to everyone(#4)Sorry you had a rough experience. I find that the incentives of the medical system on doctors tend to push them to be dismissive of anything that doesn't quite align with what they expect. They have limited time and have to see lots and lots of patients. They're under a lot of stress and often times don't have the time to be as polite as would be ideal.

As unfortunate as it is, you have to be your own health advocate. If anything similar happens again, I'd encourage you to insist on a second opinion with another doctor. 

As for doctors insisting on referring you to you by your birth gender, I think there should be the benefit of the doubt given in both directions, you to the doctors, and them to you. For various tests, likelihood of outcome, etc, your biological gender is still very relevant. If a doctor described you as a, '20 year old male' when you present as a female (sorry if that's backwards), it's likely not because they mean to be disrespectful or question the validity of your chosen gender, it may be because there could be an important medical reason for describing you that way. Obviously a doctor should never treat you dismissively and referring to you as a 'silly little girl (or boy)' is inappropriate. 

It sounds like you're on the mend, so I hope you feel better and can put this behind you. I hope that my comments don't come off as insensitive. I just wanted to point out that there could be explanations to what happened that don't necessarily justify your treatment, but could help you understand their perspective. Maybe that doctor had an experience with a patient who was vegan and wasn't responsibly managing their nutrition, and it killed them. They could be talking to you, but thinking of that other patient. Doctors are like police - they have a really tough job, and often don't set aside what happened earlier in their shift as well as they should. We should strive to be compassionate while also having high expectations of them.(#5)I was once told in an ER that I was fine and I was just panicking and overreacting. What annoyed me the most is that I paid for the visit although I have a cam get  free help, because I thought that if I pay I'll receive more attention.(#6)Anytime I‚Äôve gone to the ER once a nurse hears I have anxiety they tell gossip to the whole staff that they think it‚Äôs just anxiety, and that I must not understand what asthma is despite having it for 26 years. I‚Äôve also never been to the hospital for anxiety because I‚Äôve had enough therapy to recognize the difference between anxiety and asthma symptoms with my body, and try to keep it under control. Unfortunately when I had covid it was the one time the doctor decided to take the nurses opinion that it was anxiety despite saying other symptoms as well as an actual diagnosis, and refused to do any tests on me. They even half assed taking vitals. It wasn‚Äôt until an older nurse who said she used to work with asthma patients all the time, and could tell something was really wrong with me spoke up after checking me herself that they gave me any assistance. Granted it was just a nebulizer treatment and prednisone, but I felt validated in that moment. Especially since the nurse was pushing for tests and scans, but they didn‚Äôt listen. Ended up going somewhere else after and got tested positive which they had to notify the other hospital. I always wonder to this day how that gossiping nurse and doctor felt, and I really hope I didn‚Äôt infect the nurse that listened. It‚Äôs honestly ridiculous though and makes me hesitant to tell any doctors my mental illnesses due to stigma.(#7)Ugh.  I'm so sorry this happened to you. 

I've never really been gaslit by doctors about my asthma.  In fact, that's one of the only things they tend to take seriously, whereas a lot of other problems or potential problems are waved away with, ""well, you should lose weight."" 

But because I've had asthma my entire life I'm able to talk about it in extreme specifics and detail, and I think that really forces them to take it seriously. 

Having to advocate for your own health in a healthcare setting is a dreadful, obnoxious, demoralizing experience.(#8)>he told me I should eat more meat, even after I explained I'm vegan due to a dairy allergy

there's no dairy in meat."
"Desperately need help, bf ran out of Albuterol inhaler, no insurance",36,0.95,73,"(#1)Have you checked out the GoodRx website? I plugged in Albuterol inhaler and I can get one at Rite Aid for $18.26. I know that could be cost prohibitive to some, but it's better than full price.

This website links to some other prescription discount cards similar to GoodRx.

https://www.verywellhealth.com/best-prescription-discount-cards-4801786(#2)Go to CVS minute clinic, they can write a new script for your meds. You won't need insurance, but you can provide a credit card and negotiate payment plans for the visit. It shouldn't be too much if they are just writing a script.(#3)If you have an Rx, Mark Cuban's new generic drug company sells for $30-40

https://costplusdrugs.com/medications/

If you're close to the border (like Mexico) you can walk across to buy the Rx and bring it back, you just need the prescription.(#4)Albuterol neb solution is really cheap (inhalers are much more expensive). Go to goodrx and try to get a coupon, and then go to Walmart, costco etc. I would call ahead first and ask for pricing.(#5)Primatene Mist is sold over the counter at pharmacies. You can get it in an inhaler form or a pill. Should hold you over. Call pharmacies around you and ask if they have any. Where do y‚Äôall live?(#6)I know you said you were trying to avoid the ER, and I thank you for trying to be judicious about it. However, if he is struggling to breathe, please just go. They can give him systemic steroids then some continuous albuterol if he‚Äôs having a severe attack.

When he is insured, see if he can be referred to a specialist (pulmonologist). If he was using his inhaler that often with a maintenance med on board (inhaled corticosteroid), he may need a higher dosage or additional med to control his asthma. 

I am so sorry you all are dealing with this. The state of this country‚Äôs healthcare is a mess.(#7)Get them mailed in from another country.   
I live in Thailand and an inhaler is like $6 - $9 here. I used to pay $60.  
I'm sure you can find something online where you pay a local to buy a bunch of medicine for you and ship it to you.(#8)He needs to get on a controller med if he's using the albuterol more than 2-3 times a week. He's going to need to go to the doctor and get a prescription for the correct med.

The longer he goes untreated, the more likely he is going to end up in the hospital.(#9)I don‚Äôt have insurance either but my doctor still refill my prescription when my pharmacy requests it so that‚Äôs odd. You can always hit up an emergency room have him tell them he‚Äôs having problems with shortness of breath and he doesn‚Äôt have insurance and his script is out. I find this works for me. I‚Äôve also had to use a telehealth service and they can fill 1 inhaler prescription for you before they require you to see a doctor in person. Also as someone else mentioned GoodRx for coupons which is what I use as well. Also, I‚Äôve asked doctors for coupons to help my prescriptions be cheaper. All this is for my albuterol script.(#10)Urgent cares and teledoc can dispense prescriptions, it may cost more than you want but you‚Äôd be able to obtain a script that way. There‚Äôs some free discount prescription cards that do help, and sometimes you can get mfg rebates to get them real cheap. Is Advair the preventive? It may be worth looking into an alternate preventative like Singulair. Singular has worked wonders for me but I have to take it in the AM otherwise I get really jacked up dreams if taken in the PM. Singular comes in the generic Mononukleast I believe it‚Äôs spelled and is significantly cheaper than the brand name. Some doctors will give you a ‚Äúsample‚Äù if you don‚Äôt have coverage, i do not know if such a thing exists for Albuterol though.(#11)Hi. Go into an urgent care to get a covid test. Tell them you don‚Äôt have insurance. Then ask them to write you an inhaler script. They won‚Äôt charge you(#12)Doctors on demand app can get the script, of course its somewhere between 60 and 80 dollars. It is done via videochat.(#13)The new Cost Plus Pharmacy (mark Cuban‚Äôs venture) has albuterol! They don‚Äôt take insurance because all drugs are priced at cost plus 15%. I get my Effexor from there, it‚Äôs 1/3 the cost vs my normal pharmacy with insurance copay.(#14)His previous physician who denied seeing him or refilling his scripts because of no insurance, go to the state licensing agency and report that physician.

Not seeing a patient because they don't have insurance and refusing to refill a prescription for a potentially life saving drug is a violation of a physicians licensure and a violation of ethics. A physician cannot refuse to refill a script just because you are uninsured. 

He should see a new PCP And get a script for it. Good Rx is pretty good for rates and honestly you can get some affordable meds with it.

But he needs to call someone TODAY. It will be a miracle to get an appointment in 2 days. He doesn't want to have to resort to the expensive urgent care. So get on the phone and call places. He also needs to ask his previous physician to just refill the script for one more refil to get him through. You shouldn't need to physically see physician for a refill of abuterol.(#15)Just an Fyi... I've had asthma since I was a kid, and I've taken my share of medications for it. I am in my 40's now. I started taking Zinc for an unrelated issue and as a side effect it has nearly cured my asthma. Try taking Zinc citrate 50mg a day for a couple weeks. Then reduce the dosage to 30mg. It might work for you.(#16)Sorry for off topic, but damn how much is asthma meds where you live that you need insurance to afford it?

I literally pay 2$ my prescription asthma meds without insurance. But even without prescription it wouldn't be more than 100$ (and that is for both of my meds).

If you're from USA, I have to say... Your health care system is fucked up. Seriously... Not to be able to afford meds you need to live is outrageous. Public health care has its downsides but sure has a lot of upside benefits.(#17)Have you checked out GoodRx? I see several generic Albuterol coupons making it between $14-22. He may also have some luck with his preventative.(#18)I just wanna say good on you. I‚Äôve been in a similar situation and the people around me didn‚Äôt understand how helpless you can feel in those moments. Hopefully you managed to get something for him. Goodluck(#19)CVS will give you a preventative inhaler with no insurance, so will Walgreens.(#20)I was recently without insurance for about 6 months, and I use one rescue inhaler per month usually. I bought off people from Craigslist and offer up. It's a gamble, but I never had any issues personally(#21)He can do generic budesonide (steroid) Neb solution and get albuterol nebulizer solution (if you guys have a nebulizer)(#22)It‚Äôs a global problem when someone loses an inhaler, pharmacies should be bale to give emergency supplies(#23)OTC brochodiolator

Coming from someone who has never paid more than like $8 for Ventolin, I‚Äôm very privileged and hope that you can experience that soon(#27)How close are you to the border?(#28)I use an online pharmacy it's pretty cheap with out insurance for albuteral and montelucast(#29)[deleted](#30)He can go to an urgent care, out of pocket it will be anywhere from $150-$300. They will give him a breathing treatment and cortisone shot for immediate relief as well as an inhaler script. He can make very small monthly payments for the visit. In the mean time, allergy medicine can help to a degree. Hopefully he feels better soon, it is scary and dangerous having difficulty breathing especially for such a long time.(#31)Go to the pharmacy and ask them again for a refill. I've had this happen a good number of times. If they say they can't, they can give you a limited supply of what you want until it's time to refill your medication. Get on the phone with the doctor and tell them your situation. Don't take no! And the preventative inhaler or diskus you have might be Advair or FLUTICASONE PROPION-SALMETEROL.(#32)I might be able to help, message me if you like(#33)Cheap in mexico 5 dollars a pop(#34)My inhaler was literally $30! Do you guys use GoodRx?! Holy crap like wtf(#35)Go to an urgent care or do an urgent care visit through an app like Amwell. Explain your situation.
They can provide you with a generic alternative like symbicort or wixela which are cheaper and generic brands. Ask for a rescue inhaler as well. Then check good rx for the cheapest option to purchase them out of pocket. I am sorry you are in this situation! It is so scary. I wouldn‚Äôt let him go without it because an ER visit will cost more than the inhalers. Good luck!(#36)you can buy albuterol and flovent without a prescription from [inhousepharmacy.vu](https://inhousepharmacy.vu) . It takes some time to arrive tho.(#37)If you want, can send you some Wixela and/or Albuterol, I have 3 extra Wixelas and 2 extra Albuterols.

"Asthma, omicron, at last‚Ä¶",8,0.91,8,"(#1)Omicron gave me pneumonia smh(#2)Hope you get well soon. üôèüèª(#3)I was sick about three weeks. At the end of the first week, there were several days I was short of breath and the nebulizer didn't help much. I felt better for a few days, then at the end of the second week, I started having shortness of breath when speaking or eating and the pulse ox said 88, so I took prednisone for five days and felt better.

It's been a month since I got sick. I've got a cough that sounds worse than it feels, still taking sudafed and Mucinex. I missed my xolair injection, which usually makes me feel pretty bad if I get it late.(#4)i just had omicron on the 18th.  i was freaked the F out too...i have not well controlled and severe asthma, also COPD (im 39).  I had ZERO issues with breathing or coughing during the 2 weeks and then i developed a super small cough for a couple days after that.  

if you can, go get a real test....PCR. i have had false positive rapid tests in the past. Also, theres a covid pill, monoclonal antibody treatments, and remdesavir infusion.  I called my DR as soon as i got my positive test because i was scared, he had me do a 3 day remdesivir cycle for preventative (i am also unvaxxed by the way).  My omicron experience was flu the first night and then a headache and congestion for about 5 days.  Lost my smell and taste for a couple days but it came back......fever just for 1 day of 101.  

Try not to freak out and stress too much because that can have an effect on everything too.(#5)I feel like im having an asthma flare up right now but i have a fever . but recently today im really tired , im getting tested today(#6)I tested positive for covid Jan 10th. Pretty sure it was omicron based on the symptoms I had. I had really bad congestion and my sinuses felt like they were on fire but thankfully nothing went to my lungs. Had a chest xray now that the initial symptoms have subsided and it was all clear. But now I'm showing symptoms of chronic fatigue (tho it has to go on for 6 months to be diagnosed) so it's been fun with random sore throats and fatigue"
Venting while sick,1,1.0,2,"(#1)i had a really bad period for like 2 years straight. multiple hospital visits, i was using a full rescue inhaler within each month.  but a major factor for me was i was a smoker at the time.  i quit after almost needing to be ventilated during my last ER visit but it didnt make any real difference for many months afterward.  

the main thing that helped me was getting on the right daily maintainence inhaler.  ive gone thru so many (advair, singulair when it was inhaler form, stiolto, flovent, qvar, alvesco, etc) and i finally found one that really works for me which is suprrisingly just the new generic version for advair called wixela.  it was a miracle inhaler, literally changed my life after the first dose.  also request a referral for an actual lung specialist (pulmonologist) and get one of those allergy tests done where they put like 100 different allergens on your back to see what youre allergic to.  there could be something specific to your area (tree, pollen, etc) that is causing you issues. 

ive grown up with cats my whole life, currently have one as well.  ive never noticed any allergy to them except one specific breed.  my last hospital stay they did some allergen blood test and found that my cat dander allergy was thru the roof.  so now no cat in my bedroom and if i do let him in i run the air purifier the whole time hes in there.  t"

Had to shop local pharmacies to find one that had _one_ in stock. My usual pharmacy tried 3 times to order it, X-d out each time.(#4)Yeah, my pharmacy is trying to get an alternative approved.

But if you can‚Äôt wait and are in the US I believe you can buy some rescue inhalers over the counter. It‚Äôs not the same Albuterol but it‚Äôs suppose to work.(#2)Can you identify a trigger? I‚Äôd be safe and get a new Rx. But your doctor will probably want you to come in first(#3)ALWAYS have a rescue inhaler on you.theyre usually good for over a year when you have a new one.....cant hurt to just have it around.   asthma attack can come out of nowhere.  When i was younger and my asthma wasnt that bad i could sneeze, or laugh and it would send me into an attack.(#4)As someone who has been In that spot I can say you will definitely want to find a long acting  bronchodilator at least try the fluticasone inhaler. It's usually $20-$30 with no insurance. Doctor bill online is like $50 and yeah they can write all the appropriate prescriptions, I've done it. Trust me don't put it off or you will end up going to the hospital 9 times in one year like me and racking up $10k. Also life is not near as depressing and hard when you can breathe.(#5)Get in to be seen, or ask for a video appointment with your GP and ask for a new prescription for a rescue inhaler. Should be able to get a new one thru a local pharmacy such as Walgreens pretty cheap using GoodRX. Keep your old inhaler on hand until then (efficacy goes down once its expired, but if you're afraid of a repeat attack, it's better than nothing - I keep my old ones for just such a reason, since I have flair up attacks so rarely)."

Why switching asthma inhaler could be better for you and the planet,10,0.81,31,"(#1)[deleted](#2)Yeah next time I have an asthma attack I‚Äôll just go fuck myself. It‚Äôs better for the planet right?(#3)My inhaler is a dry powder, whenever I show it to people they always look shocked that I got to do the work of inhaling it rather than it spraying into me; I've never had a spray one, but the powder works well and I wouldn't think of switching(#4)I lived in Morocco for two years recently and went back to the old school CFC Ventolin inhalers‚Ä¶ sooooooo much better.(#5)I think the damage of sugar production and consumption should be addressed first.

Especially being that it‚Äôs the source of a lot of illness and disease.(#6)Probably the healthcare systems in different countries will take time to catch up with this.(#7)I use bricanyl and  symbicort turbohalers mainly because aerosols caused me to cough when taking them. I have been taking them about 15 years.(#8)Really interesting read. I hadn't realised ""dry powder"" inhalers were a thing, but great to hear how much better for the environment they would be. Has anyone made the swap? How do you find these?(#9)I'm glad dry powder works for some people but it didn't for me. Something about having to suck out medicine into my lungs while I was struggling to breathe just didn't work for me...

But sure BBC, blame me being sick for climate change. Not those who have the decision power to reduce pollution and climate change.(#10)At one time these ‚Äúinhalers‚Äù were changed.   Someone had also given me that purple dinosaur Barney looking dry inhaler Advair.  And the second I tried it, I was not happy at all but felt like I am going to die.  I had to let a doctor go because he was a dick to me asking me again his face getting meaner and I said what part of it made me feel like I was going to die didn‚Äôt you understand?

And there was not enough propellant to get the medication into your lungs properly.  Also if you saying my inhaler contributes 4 percent to greenhouse gasses I am finding that number hard to believe, very hard.

Also I lived before inhalers it was not a nice time and I ended up in the hospital a lot because of it.  One when we lived up north as a kid I would end up in an Oxygen Tent ‚õ∫Ô∏è in Hospital and when we moved to Florida I would end up in the Emergency room getting shots of Epinephrine and Susphirine both or these options were pure adrenaline and I cannot stand another adrenaline shot because the last one I received my head felt like a blood vessel was ready to burst in my frontal lobe.  I told them to bring me something for pain please my head was killing me.  So 25 minutes later the nurse shows up with nothing BRING ME SOMETHING FOR PAIN NOWWWWWWW I‚Äôm sure most of the hospital heard that.  And the small morphine shot helped only dull it a small bit.

So I can‚Äôt even have the Adrenaline shot anymore."

Asthma has been bad now for a year,11,0.93,14,"(#1)Have you spoken to your doctor about this? 

Mine got bad after being controlled when I got sick. First they put me on Singulair which helped a bit. And then Spiriva which is so far a game changer for me(#2)My asthma is greatly affected by my weight and diet.

At 160 lb. my asthma was a rarity, when I hit 260 lb. it got out of control. Every ten pounds that I've lost since hitting that top weight has a noticeable affect on my asthma.

Diet-wise, the lowest carb my diet, the better.  When I'm on keto, I do better. Even 20% of my diet being carbs helps.

When I'm eating tons of carbs and sugar, I tend to have more attacks.(#3)Not to wade into shitty waters here‚Ä¶

And full disclosure, I‚Äôm vaccinated‚Ä¶

But did you get the vaccine? I feel like my rescue inhaler usage went up a little when I got the Moderna vaccine‚Ä¶ Not sure if its in my head or not(#4)happened to me and this was after i quit smoking ( makes sense right?) i switched from advair to wixela and i was able to cut my rescue usage down by over 50% on day 1.  A lot of people say wixela doesnt work but it sure did for me. its supposed to be just a generic for advair......so idk why it would work and advair doesnt.  

anyway, my point is you may just need to try other options.  Alveesco was another one that helped me.(#5)look into what you're doing. you have some kind of allergy you need to figure out.

Sulfites is a big one for me.

also I don't use inhalers anymore now that I know my trigger.

Products that help keep the house and aie clean,5,0.86,9,"(#1)She needs to see a doctor and get on the right controller med along with allergy meds.(#2)Great question! Cleaning is definitely helpful but sometimes the act of cleaning can trigger symptoms. Is there a lot of dust in your house? Does she know what cleaning products trigger her asthma? I can‚Äôt use harsh chemicals like bleach, but certain things like white vinegar to mop the floors don‚Äôt bother me. That said, if mold and mildew is an issue in your home, you may have to clean it with bleach while she is out of the house and then air it out.

Here‚Äôs my routine:

I dry swiffer the floors a few times a week since I have a dog, vacuum once a week, dust every 2 weeks (with a damp cloth or swiffer), mop every 2 weeks,  and wipe down bathroom surfaces weekly / as needed. If you have a lot of carpeting, it‚Äôs a good idea to vacuum more frequently and invest in a good quality vacuum, like a Dyson. I‚Äôd also recommend washing your sheets after vacuuming and dusting to get rid of any dust particles you may have disturbed during the cleaning process. Lastly, make sure you‚Äôre changing your HVAC filters regularly. You may have to do that more often than recommended.

If your girlfriend is doing the cleaning or in the house while you‚Äôre cleaning, she should try wearing a mask and opening the windows in the house. Usually cleaning doesn‚Äôt bother me too much, but if I‚Äôm already flaring, I may have to step away and know when it‚Äôs time to take a break.(#3)Get an air purifier (portable) with UV light (to kill any mold spore in the air). Check the filtering efficiency for your room size too!(#4)Bissell and Honeywell make great Air purifiers. Get a good HEPA vacuum. Allergy covers for mattress and pillows."

Asthma has been bad now for a year,3,1.0,0,
Why switching asthma inhaler could be better for you and the planet,1,0.67,6,"(#1)We‚Äôve been through this circus before. CFC inhalers had a tiny impact environmentally but were better at propelling medication and didn‚Äôt cause as many reactions as HFA inhalers. The price of inhalers went up because drug companies could claim it was a whole new inhaler even though the medication itself stayed the same. People have been harmed by the switch. 

There are a thousand other things to go after before medical devices for disabled people. How about banning cars from London altogether? Invest in better trains. The roads we don‚Äôt need can be replaced with green spaces. Pay for solar panels for every home. Then fewer people would need their inhalers and kids could play in their neighborhoods without dodging cars. Win win. 

It‚Äôs like the straw bans - lots of harm for disabled people, a fraction of a tiny percent of an insignificant impact measured against corporate decisions about plastics.(#2)I have to say‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not a fan of the newest inhaler. Give me back my old school one like the photo, the digi inhaler is not conducive to the worst of my attacks because it I HAVE to take a deep breathe in to get ANYTHING and that isn‚Äôt always possible."
"Just started Singulair, when should I ask about a rescue inhaler?",7,1.0,17,"(#1)NO PRIMATENE !!! Nasty stuff. Only in emergencies. 

Your doctor didn‚Äôt give you a rescue inhaler ? WTF ? 

Also waking up / backdrip symptoms are common to we wheezies with allergies. Something to knock back the allergies helps too.

Have a serious conversation with your doctor about root causes, maintenance, and rescue inhalers.(#2)i find singulair stops me from having flare ups or even attacks from happening but even on singulair alone i still get flare ups . you need a rescue inhaler(#3)Please be cautious on Singulair. It is a hardcore truly last resort medication. It recently was labeled with a black box warning. It had to change its notice from it might cross the blood brain barrier to IT WILL. It can and may cause severe neuropsychiatric events and a myriad of other symptoms. Doctors downplay said side effects because it‚Äôs been on the market since the 90‚Äôs. But the testing done in the med trials back then was far inadequate compared to todays studies. 

I can‚Äôt go down the rabbit hole. But if I could go back in time and give myself a full warning of the drug rather than, ‚Äúoh it may cause nightmares.‚Äù

It helped me a ton initially. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was missing. But in a matter of time the poison got through. 

Some of us with life long damage from the drug have undergone genetic testing to find we lack certain processors that breakdown the sodium which must get trapped in our brains. While that is not indicative of symptoms. It does typically show more with individuals effected after stopping meds post 4-6 month withdrawal. 

Leukotriene receptors are a bitch. 

 I just want you to know that if you‚Äôre on that med where you could procure and have a knife to your wrists and your trying to figure out why you should be alive and you can‚Äôt remember how you got there. 
Or if you keep imagining and seeing terrible things happening. It‚Äôs not you. If your weight severely fluctuates, you hear voices, get extremely moody, feel tingling in the elbows, have a change in diet, have a sudden loss in interest of previous habits, if you start developing temper tantrums, if you start imaging hurting yourself or a loved one. 

If you feel something off to your gut. Get off that med in an educated tapered fashion. Know you‚Äôre not alone.

Weird dyspnea,10,1.0,10,"(#1)Yes, this! No idea what causes it. But because of so much mucus I try to drink enough water. Usually feel better after a good cough and clearing. Never got prednisone for it. If you find out what it is or how to stop it please post an update?

edit to add that I also have eosinophilic asthma and just had a 3rd dose of Fasenra. I use much less albuterol and I'd say it cut the mucus in half so far. in 6 weeks is the first maintenance dose so I think it's still working it's cellular level magic.(#2)I have mild/moderate controlled allergic asthma and I get the same thing quite often. I‚Äôve never had an oral steroid for it and I honestly rarely take ventolin for it and just wait until it passes. I feel like I need to take a super deep breath or force myself to yawn to get enough air. I only recently mentioned it to my allergist and she ordered a spirometry test. I‚Äôm still waiting on the results 6 weeks later (yay free healthcare???). 

I wish I had something actually helpful to contribute but you‚Äôre not alone!! I hope you can get it figured out soon, and please update us if you do!(#3)yes and i have to constantly yawn to get the feeling of being able to take a deep breath(#4)I have small airways asthama, so the symptoms of that can be short of breathe but no so much wheezing or even a very long drop in lung function. 

Lots of doctors don't know much about this. They think asthma is in the large airways where it is easy to see the decline when inflamed, in small airways asthma you might actually show new normal lung function, and main symptom might be a short of breath feeling.

Also ventolin really doesn't help much or at least as instant as other types of asthma.

it might be related to cough variant asthma (or start as it) , might also be related to GERD, allergies ..

they didn't even think asthma could be in small airways until they discovered it durning otopsiy research, and sure enough, some people have asthma in their small airways but not so much in their large.. so different symptom.

also, for this need small particles in the ICS, and there is other meds that help that aren't always for asthma (COPD meds)

Advice for someone struggling with asthma living in a big city?,10,0.87,14,"(#1)Air purifier(s) at home, possibly new or additional asthma and allergy meds.  Might not be realistic, but consider moving back.(#2)Find the trees, visit them often. Seriously. Find the clean air, and visit it regularly.(#3)If your not opposed to masks they can help to, especially on smoggy or fire days. I have a brand of washable ones I like to use. And I also second the more or different medication talk with your doctor about it. Sometimes it takes a few tires to find the right combo.(#4)Yeah, monitoring your air quality inside is important. Hopefully you have windows that seal well and a house/apartment that doesn‚Äôt leak air and dust/smog.  If you have your own HVAC with a filter you can change, use high quality filters and change them every 3-4 months (more if you have pets).

Other than that, she should talk to her doctor about changing up her controller medicines, either the dosage or trying different ones.  There‚Äôs a dizzying array of controller meds available now and they all work a little differently. 

Allergy meds might help, too. 

And also time will help. She‚Äôll aclimate. 

Best of luck.(#5)Is she on a controller med? If she's using the rescue inhaler more than 2-3 times a week, she needs to see a doctor about getting on a controller, not having a nebulizer to use more albuterol.(#6)Air purifier inside and a mask when you‚Äôre outdoors. What is the humidity in your new place if it‚Äôs low that sometimes messes with me too so possibly look into a humidifier.(#7)Many good tips already given. 

Something else that helps me is going to a Turkish Baths (steam bath) or trying to recreate the experience at home in the shower or over a bowl of hot water with a towel over the head. Salt water treatments also work well for me sometimes (but I used to get those at the doctors office, so not sure how practical that is).(#8)+1 to air purifiers with HEPA filter

+1 find a local park you can visit as often as possible. Daily walks would be awesome. It helps!

Air out your home every day if you can, if it‚Äôs cold, I do this when I‚Äôm out for an errand/walk then close the windows when I return.

Asthma <> Sleep Apnea,5,0.86,6,"(#1)My asthma was diagnosed during a sleep study. I have very mild asthma, and moderate sleep apnea (around 12 apneas per hour). I use symbacort, but that never helps my sleep apnea. What did help was becoming more physically fit. I figure that my lungs got ""stronger"" and thats better for breathing, and thats better for reducing apneas. Losing weight will most likely help too if you are overweight like me.(#2)This sounds like a discussion you should have with your doctor.(#3)Have you had any spirometry done recently? Had asthma all my life but have recently been  diagnosed with excessive dynamic airway collapse which can be the cause of sleep apnoea. It effects the large airways so they aren't open enough when you breathe out. If you often feel that something is blocking your breath as you breathe out it would be worth looking into.

For runners with EI asthma - do you run faster in warm weather than cold? Does the cold temperature slow down your times?,10,1.0,16,"(#1)Colder temperature than 0 gives me asthma attacks if I dont take mesures - wear a buff over the mouth and go at a reasonable pace. I definately cant go fast or even compete in winter. As far as the science goes, it has been proven that doing intense endurance exercise in cold temperatures is not ideal even for healthy individuals. The cold dry air dries up the lung tissue that can get damaged overtime - xc skiers asthma is a real thing.(#2)In short, yes. Best times I ever had were in Florida, mid-70s, with humid air. Worst is anything below like 40 or 50 depending on where I‚Äôm at in the country.(#3)Ooo thanks for the response! Let me edit a little with a few more details.

In Summer, around 75 degree (23c weather) I was running at 9.3 minute (5‚Äô30) mile pace and now it‚Äôs winter and I‚Äôm running at 10‚Äô36 pace in 57 degree weather (14c degrees) and I‚Äôm wondering if the time loss is due to the asthma and lack of airflow or if I‚Äôve just gotten worse haha. Eager to know if other runners with asthma might experience this with seasonality!(#4)I do parkrun every Saturday, over the last couple of months I have been 2 to 3 minutes slower than my summer runs. Training sessions with my club have been much harder since around November and I have had a few attacks that have left me feeling rough for a couple of days after.

So temperature definitely affects my times.(#5)So there are actually people with EI asthma that can run?!?! I can‚Äôt run, regardless of outside temp. I walk to stay in shape and I have to bring my rescue inhaler with me. Most times I pre-dose and I‚Äôm fine, but not always. Even hot yoga causes flair ups and I have to use my inhaler.

For reference I use a daily steroid inhaler and use my rescue inhaler as needed.(#6)Yes, I run fast in heat, very slow in cold(#7)Everyone slows down regardless of asthma when the temps get over 80F because the body cannot shed heat fast enough.(#8)Running outside in the cold is unbearable for me with my asthma. I think anything less than 40 degrees causes me pain. However (thanks to COVID) I found out that a cloth mask helps me out. So in a pinch I can wear a mask if I need to run outside.

But usually I just find a good treadmill and use it instead.

ETA: to answer your question it absolutely does slow me down. I factor that in part of my runs though and try to not get disheartened.(#9)Yes 100% cold weather slows me down."

most asthmatics cannot take IBUPROFEN as it gives them an asthma attack

I can't go near the stuff, not even gels(#6)In winter some people get kinda low vitamin d levels, so if I would be you beside going to see a doctor, I would take low vitamin d supplements, since low levels can make asthma more servere. Other supplements you can take (but of course always in low dosages since no doctor told you to take them) are: Omega 3 and Vitamin C (but not at the same time, theres at least one study I know about negative effects when taken together)

Drink and sleep enough(#7)I‚Äôd say get started on prednisone ASAP please speak to your doctor(#8)I have morphine as a back-up plan, it sorta takes the panic out of my brain at the same time it helps with the pain.(#9)You could try buying a steam inhaler and using it for 1-2 hours a day. Helps with my minor winter asthma but I recognize your asthma is much worse.(#10)You need see a doctor and no, you can not wait till monday. If you can't breath properly while laying down then thats a big red flag for some major problem. The way you are describing things it sounds to me like you might have pneumonia. If you do not get medication for this it will only get worse untill you damage your lungs beyond repair, or even die.  
Stop asking random people on the internet, stop browing reddit, go find medical help, today.(#11)My friend used to sit his daughter in front of the freezer with her face in there to breath in the cold dry air. Also, he'd try the hot humid air, just sitting on the toilet in the bathroom with the shower on to steam it up. 

I personally have never tried either, but as a kid I noticed the nebulizer would help with tough attacks. Same meds were in it, but it takes longer and forces you to sit and focus on breathing deeply and slowly.(#12)Have you tried a cough suppressant with an expectorant?"
How do I survive an asthma attack without an inhaler?,39,0.95,65,"(#1)I would start with finding a different doctor.(#2)Check to see if it's also an anxiety/panic attack. I was having the same issues (I'm asthmatic) and found out I was having some mild panic attacks. The fact that you say you stiffen up and you remain still and it passes makes me feel like it's something like that.(#3)None of us are doctors and if you‚Äôve been to a doctor and they‚Äôve said it isn‚Äôt asthma, that‚Äôs worth listening to, at least a little. 

Are you an adult?  If so, it might be worth pressing your doctor to help try to diagnose what‚Äôs going on.  It could be a lot of things.  

Be carful with Primatine Mist. It‚Äôs basically pure adrenaline, and it can help with asthma symptoms, but it‚Äôs not good to use long term. 

Also, I gotta ask: ‚Äúafter getting hit?‚Äù  Are you okay?(#4)Okay‚Ä¶ ignoring the doctor / diagnostic concerns‚Ä¶..

Here is what to do when you‚Äôre having trouble breathing.

First‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt panic. Let your anxiety flow out of you. (This is a hard skill to master). Relax‚Ä¶..

Deliberately breathe slowly. Exhale fully slowly , then inhale slowly. Ignore wheezing noises and just focus on slowing your breathing and breathing completely.

Once you are under control, you can slowly move into other remedies.

Warm water vapor helps calm the sinuses and bronchia. Hold a hot teacup of water under your nose and breathe the steam. (Don‚Äôt scale yourself). Set your shower on super hot, and sit in the bathroom and breathe the steam. And so forth.

Coffee is a natural bronchodilator. Have a cup. Relax. Don‚Äôt do too much caffeine because you‚Äôll get a bit twitchy.

And rest and relax.

Personal story:
I‚Äôve been an asthmatic my whole life. And before Albuterol inhalers existed, I had to survive based on my wits and take some pretty gnarly medicine. 

I was cross country skiing a few miles from my house in my early teens. Farmland. A blizzard blew up. And I started having an acute asthma attack.

I dug a hasty snow cave, put the skis in an ‚ÄúX‚Äù over it, crawled in, and passed out. Woke up several hours later , the cave mouth was buried in snow. Asthma attack had passed, so I dug myself out and skied home. If I had panicked and tried to ski home I would have passed out in the field and frozen to death.

Don‚Äôt panic !!!(#5)Sitting in a room with a warm shower running used to help me as a kid. 

People here saying you need a new doctor - get a second opinion - learn about **why** your doctor says you don't have athasma as well.(#6)As an asthma sufferer, I have ‚Äúsurvived without inhalers‚Äù by opening up coffee grounds an smelling them every once in a while. Idk what it did but it helped and eventually got rid of the attack. 

That said. Please talk to somebody about anxiety. Also you may be having gas from food triggers. There are many things that can make you feel like it‚Äôs difficult to breathe 

All the best(#7)You may have anxiety. Anxiety mimics some of the symptoms of an attack.

Wheezing does not necessarily mean asthma. Someone who is out of shape can wheeze heavily after exercise and not have asthma.(#8)I know exactly what youre talking about . does it feel like you cannot get a deep breath in and you feel like you needfor air as well as coughing along with a wheeze ?(#9)Sometimes a PFT can be normal but then a methacholine challenge can show asthma. Have you had a methacholine challenge? 

Another thing to ask about is VCD, vocal cord dysfunction. Not all pulmonologists seem to be particularly helpful with this but ultimately treatment is often thru a speech therapist teaching breathing techniques to get the vocal cords to relax during an episode. VCD triggers can be the same as asthma triggers and the patient can often report similar symptoms to asthma.(#10)Sounds like a panic attack.(#11)I've been without an inhaler and had an attack. This only applies to mild asthmatics. Stop physical movement. I would take a deep breath and hold it.  Then slowly release it. As best as I could. I would repeat until my breathing calmed down. I would still feel tightness in my chest, but the sure attack was over. 
For reference: the first time this happened was in middle school and the school required all meds to be in the nurse's office. I was in the middle of gym class and couldn't climb the stairs to the nurse. The second time happened in high school. I had just gone from 1st period (which was the bottom floor of a 4 story building) to second period (which was on the opposite side and the top floor). Not two seconds after getting to class, a fire drill hit. So, I went back down to the ground floor and exited the building. Only to go back upstairs a few minutes later. Yeah, asthma attack ensued. My teacher panicked, put me in her chair while another student ran to the nurse's office for my inhaler. The nurse's office at my high school was in a different building on the opposite side of campus, and on the second floor. There was no way I was going to make it. 
It took the nurse like 10 minutes to get to me. All while I'm trying to calm my breathing, my teacher is half in tears being me not to die. 
Once I was better, she rose hell with the principal and vice principal, and I was allowed to keep my inhaler on me from that point forward.(#12)I could be wrong but my understanding is any wheezing = asthma or allergy. Neither one is nothing. 

I‚Äôm almost positive wheezing is not a sign of an anxiety attack. Now you might have anxiety during an asthma or allergy attack (especially an untreated one!) but the wheezing is not from anxiety. 

Get a new doctor.(#13)Ok here is the question: why did the doctor say it wasn‚Äôt asthma? We‚Äôre you tested? They can give you a test where they provoke it and if you have asthma it will happen and they can measure it. Did you get this test. What was your doctors reason? 

What was happening when you were wheezing? We‚Äôre you exposed to an allergen that could trigger asthma like smoke? Exercising? 

At the very least, get a second opinion.(#14)Haven‚Äôt really heard of people stiffening up from asthma. *Being hit?* When you have an asthma attack and it passes on its own you will be physically drained. Like every single muscle will be aching for oxygen and it becomes a chore just standing up.  People don‚Äôt realize how much energy your body actually uses when you breathe.(#15)I'd go see another doctor for a second opinion, but I have anxiety/panic attacks and asthma and sometimes a panic attack can feel like an asthma attack.(#16)I‚Äôll tell you a little story;

Back in 2020 I drove down to California from Vancouver, 20 hour drive. On the way home in the middle of California and literal nowhere I started to have an asthma attack and didn‚Äôt have my inhaler. I‚Äôve never felt so scared in my life, but I managed to park on the side of the road and focus on my breathing; inhaling in slowly, exhaling slowly with some mental reassurance that I was still in fact breathing ok, it took about half hour and I was able to calm myself down.

It sounds more like a panic attack, so I‚Äôd just focus on your breathing and positive talk. You‚Äôre going to be ok, just breathe. 

Best of luck(#17)Different doctor asap(#18)better doctor that will actually test you.(#19)I‚Äôd recommend a second opinion. 

This said. Not all asthma is the same and some things can be allergies or anxiety. Also people out here suggesting nothing else going on must be anxiety‚Ä¶ either don‚Äôt have anxiety or need dif ones themselves. 

If you feel like there is a physical cause for this then push for finding it. 

Some causes can even surprise you(and doctors too sometimes). 

That said I‚Äôm not a doctor. Please seek medical advice and take Reddit with a grain, even here.(#20)Agreed with everyone to get another doctor. Asthma is linked (or is, I‚Äôm no doctor, lol) a histamine response. Taking an allergy pill helps that response. It‚Äôs important to learn your triggers and avoid them. Steam baths help. Warm water helps. Avoid dairy. But, for real, go to another doctor. It‚Äôs not that difficult to get an inhaler.(#21)"" doctor says I'm just lazy and need more exercise.""  -  I very much doubt they said that.

&#x200B;

maybe you are exercising too hard for your ability, get a heart rate monitor and make sure you are not going into the anaerobic zone to much. (burning more oxygen than you can breath in) - google Heart Rate training and stay in the cardio range.

&#x200B;

what do you mean ""I get an attack after exercise or being hit"" ??  -  are you boxing?  not many people can box for 3 mins even with good lungs - again check your heart rate and maybe work with a trainer who can advise you how to train for you current fitness level(#22)Depending on where u are u can often get primatine mist inhalers OTC although you should really see another doctor for spirometry(#23)Get a second opinion, asthma or not something's up.



Also, don't try to stop these attacks by inhaling whatever people tell you to inhale. Every body is different, someone's cure may be your trigger. For example: the warm shower solution would make my asthma attack worse because of the humidity. On the other hand, I wait my asthma attacks out by laying in my bed, which is discouraged because breathing in this position is more difficult. But I do that because my asthma attacks can get so bad sitting would be a huge waste of energy.


So, until you'll get the diagnosis and meds avoid getting triggered - don't exercise or at least do it safely. If you'll still get an attack don't panic and, you can wait it out if you want go but don't wait for too long. I suggest you to go to the hospital asap. Even if the attacks don't seem severe you can't know that without seeing a professional. I tried to wait my last asthma attack out, it was painful so I went to the hospital feeling like a huge drama queen and turned out that it was an actual emergency, I could have died and the doctors wanted me to stay there for a few days but hospitals freak me out so I left.(#24)Get a second opinion from another doctor ASAP. Do not put it off! As for the advice, try to stay calm, take slow and deep breaths, hydrate, maybye make a coffe (caffein helps tiny bit). Call an ambulance if you feel too sick. If you start choking, just call immediately or have someone do it.(#25)Google breathing techniques(#26)Depending on where you live you should be able to get an over the counter inhaler. It‚Äôs called Primatene Mist where I live. I use it instead or prescribed Albuterol because my doctors never give me enough refills because my asthma is very mild but I need multiples because I travel for work just in case. Primatene Mist works well for me.(#27)when im without ins or its too soon to get a refill i buy off craigslist or offerup(#28)If you are having an attack have a cup of coffee, can have sugar but no dairy. This is not a full time solution but it can help when you got nothing else.

Also as others are saying plz get a new doctor, if u do have asthma it needs to be taken seriously.(#29)See a new doctor. Also hot coffee usually helps in give you some temporary relief but you should definitely see a doctor.(#30)Heard you chew a coffee bean(#31)Drink Coffee. Take Mucinex- it will clear the lungs."
Anyone with a similar timeline?,0,0.5,4,"(#1)Thorough accurate allergy testing, to include food. zlook up cross pollinators in allergies. Lastly, look into genetic testing. This is what I am doing.  Allergies have been worse,  developed asthma like 3 years ago.  Started shots, but take long time to work. I have a moderately high Ige. Inflammation is at the root of evil I believe.(#2)Have you been to an asthma and allergy specialist? If not, you should. Helps a lot. My asthma came on when I was about 30, I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs now. The specialist got me on the right meds so my life is pretty normal and I can exercise or do whatever I want. Any time I get a respiratory cold, flu, etc I go to him instead of my primary doctor."
is it my asthma? is it covid? is it my GERD triggering my asthma? is it just the cold? seeking advice!,6,0.87,6,"(#1)I don't know what that sensation is called but I know what you mean. It's like a warning signal I might be asking for prednisone soon....or maybe not!

And I am in a similar boat this week. Known covid exposure, symptoms with dry cough, significant SOB congestion seems limited to sinuses. Started developing GI symptoms yesterday. No fever though. I have asthma and LPR....and three negative rapid tests.(#2)Things like fever, joint pain and migraine most probably arent caused by asthma. From what you are saying it looks like you are sick with flu/covid/common cold and you might be having asthma flare up on top of that. Respiratory infection is a massive trigger for many asthmatics. Ofc this is just a guess and I‚Äôm not a doctor so its for the best to keep consulting it with them.(#3)Fever, migraine, joint pain are not asthma. Some of the other things could definitely be GERD.(#4)i had major back pain and other joint pain with covid.  my first day and a half felt like a bad flu and then it was just some congestionand a scratchy throat.  

i got lucky and it didnt affect my asthma at all.  althoughi have developed a mild cough now ( 3 weeks later).  honestly youl just have to wait for the PCR.  with omicron the symptoms and severity are soo all over the place from one person to another."
Advice Needed! Using a spacer and peak flow for first time.,2,0.75,10,"(#1)I do it in the morning after I use my inhaler. Best of 3 tries gets recorded.

With a spacer, you don't take a deep breath. Watch a YouTube on how to use one.

Rinse it with water the same as you would any other thing that goes in your mouth.(#2)1. I personally don‚Äôt have to use a peak flow, but it‚Äôs ideal to do it in the morning before you take your inhaler, later on during the day, and if you‚Äôre able to remember, before and after you take your rescue inhaler during an exacerbation. 
2. It honestly depends on if you have a spacer or if you have a VHC. The spacer doesn‚Äôt have a little one-way valve that holds your medication inside , so once you press it, you gotta breathe in through your mouth, or it‚Äôs just going to the air after you take your mouth off of it. 
The VHC lets you press your inhaler and holds all your medication until you take a slow, deep breath. I personally do a couple deep breaths in and out to ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù before I take a hit of my inhaler, and it‚Äôs helped a bit. If you still feel like you can‚Äôt get a nice, deep breath in with a VHC, you can try a couple times before you do another puff (if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve been prescribed). 
3. The most dreaded part - actually cleaning the spacer. I personally have a Phillips OptiChamber Diamond, which is a VHC. It comes apart in several pieces, so you‚Äôre not struggling clean every little tight space. I rinse mine in warm water once a week, then soak it in a small tub of warm water and a little dish soap for a bit and then let it dry. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using a brush because it can cause microabrasions inside your spacer/VHC and damage the anti-static properties (?), making the medication stick to the chamber itself and not fully go into your lungs. 

That was super long, but I hope it kind of helps!"

Your experience with Xolair for asthma?,3,1.0,8,"(#1)No side effects whatsoever. Literally saved my life. I am 22F and have been on it since I was 15. I get 2 shots every 3 weeks. Its a literal godsend. I can now use shampoos and other beauty products that are actually good for my hair.  I used to have to pick products solely based on if the scent would trigger my allergies/asthma. I also have 2 cats now. (Im still allergic to cats but I adopted ones that don‚Äôt trigger me). My grades went up because I can actually breathe now. My asthma and allergies were so bad I was taking a nebulizer every morning and night, I had so much brain fog that I barely remember middle school because I was just constantly struggling to breathe. Xolair is the only reason I have been able to get my shit together. I graduate with a bachelors in a couple of months and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it without Xolair. 
I got new insurance this year and they are giving me a really hard time getting approval for Xolair so this is one of the few times I am off of it. Last dose was December 3rd and I was due on Christmas. Due to scheduling conflicts, I couldn‚Äôt get in till after the new year and now my insurance won‚Äôt approve me. Since going off of it, I can‚Äôt walk and talk without getting out of breath, I was having 12+ asthma attacks/day and now I am on 50mg of Prednisone/day just to function until i can get my insurance to cooperate. When I am on Xolair, I am still on the highest dose of advair and I tend to need my inhaler anywhere between 0 and 5 times a week depending on the weather. When it‚Äôs below 30¬∞ outside, I always need my inhaler from breathing in the cold air so that could be multiple times in one day but my asthma and allergies do bot get in the way of my life when I have Xolair. My dad is exactly the same way and it changed his life to. I hope it helps you like it helped us.(#2)On it since May 2021, and it's made a big difference for me. I was able to reduce my asthma meds, and foods that I was allergic to don't bug me as much (but they still do a bit).(#3)Did absolutely nothing for me and I don't recall any side effects.(#4)I've been on it for years and it's wonderful. I haven't had to take steroids for asthma in years (only one for bronchitis). I'm off of advair and will hopefully be off of singulair soon. 

It does make me really tired each time after my shots, but it's totally worth it.(#5)It worked well for 1 year. Like things that usually triggered me didn't. After one year, it stopped working and I was having attacks almost daily. So I stopped the Xolair and added more inhalers.(#6)My asthma got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt tolerate perfumes and certain smells. Xolair changed my life and not only am I off all inhalers, but my allergies have improved too. It took about 6-8 months to start to feel a difference, and at about month 9-10 is when I was substantially better to the point where I‚Äôm  off all inhalers including rescue inhalers, as well as off singular. Also in better shape because I can exercise without my asthma interfering. I haven‚Äôt noticed any side effects. I don‚Äôt feel the tiredness like others are saying. Like someone else send, it‚Äôs been a godsend. I have much more energy and feel better overall, and more productive. Give it a try and be patient with it!"
Drinking a daily vitamin C supplement improved my asthma,12,0.8,15,"(#1)I think theres nearly no studies which proof that vitamin c has a positive effect on asthma in adults. But I also take it and if it helps you, definitly go on taking it!(#2)I guess I'll double my c and see if I get the same results !(#3)I mean, I'm not downplaying it, but that's just what a healthy diet does for your lungs. 

There are lots of good foods that have some anti-inflammatory properties like ginger. 

Your medicine is not the enemy, the price is.(#4)More than likely it's the placebo effect. You honestly don't need supplements if you eat a healthy diet.(#5)I do the same. I have vitamin C tabs and dump half of one to my water bottle, at least a couple of times a day. I noticed it makes a difference for me, and I notice it when I don‚Äôt do this for a while. I find I recover way faster. 

Also sometimes use electrolyte drinks, especially if sick or it I‚Äôm exercising a lot. That seems to help too.(#6)[deleted](#7)Doh, those particular ones actually set my asthma off. Can take vit C in tablet form without problems though. Will try that.(#8)I did a few years of Hesperiden (Vit C) as a teenager because Mum *made* me.

Is it possible to train your body enough it will operate like you don't have asthma?,1,0.67,9,"(#1)Joining choir helped me work on breath control, which can help, but beyond that‚Ä¶medication is really your best bet.(#2)There are probably things you can do to improve it. I've heard nose breathing works miracles if you ever get a chance to read ""breath"" by James Nestor. It takes work though. Breathing exercises are great and good medication and healthy living all help.(#3)It all depends on the kind of asthma you have. For some people building up enough stamina makes them symptom free, for others it only improves their condition. Your pulmonologist can probably tell you more about that. You can also go to a physical therapist specialized in asthma/lung diseases to work on stuff like that.(#4)Wear a mask over your face to prewarm the air. It's what I used to do when I was a ski instructor.(#5)I wouldn‚Äôt think so‚Ä¶?  Are you on a controller med?(#6)I do a lot of backcountry skiing and ski touring. My asthma has been well controlled for many years, and I‚Äôve had very little or no problems in the backcountry at all. Now I‚Äôm on the wrong meds and everything is a mess. So I suggest getting a preventer that works well for you as a first step. Then do lots of relevant training all year long to get better strength and stamina. I find circuit training very good and relevant for skiing and ski touring, as you train both muscles and stamina.(#7)I find that as my fitness improves my baseline (outside flare-ups) threshold for when exercise induced asthma kicks in absolutely rises. So in a sense, yes, but you can temporarily lose all that improvement at once in a flare-up (I'm having one now, it's great fun /s). Similarly, an old asthma treatment used to be to send people to the mountains (good air with low pollutant and allergen levels, it is helpful up to a point)

Controller medications are more reliable though and coexist nicely with improving your fitness and living at altitude.(#8)I'm sure within reason it is. 

Mental and physical training is a good idea for us all. Doesn't mean you won't still have some struggles but almost certainly will help anyones symptoms improve.(#9)There are definitely things I can do to limit my experience with asthma. One thing thar helps me is intentionally triggering my asthma with exercise before the actual activity I want to do.

If I have a basketball game in 30 minutes I'll make sure to warm up by running to the game and pushing hard enough to trigger my asthma. I use my inhaler and keep walking/jogging and generally by the time the game actually starts my asthma has gone away and will now stay away for the remainder of the game. Idk if that would work for others, but it's a way to manage it for me"
Heart palpitations from shoveling snow,13,0.89,27,"(#1)Skipped beats/palpitations are very common in most people. But can also mean an underlying condition.

Asthmatics should do a pre workout, some low level cardio before you want to exercise to stop a bronchospasm.

Your opinions,3,0.8,5,"(#1)general doctors are bad at diagnosing asthma. find an allergist or pulmonologist for a real look.(#2)My doctor thought mine was anxiety too, I basically had to beg for more than a rescue inhaler. What‚Äôs the harm in trying inhalers and seeing if it gets better?(#3)Go on amazon, buy a pulse oximeter that goes on the end of your finger and measures oxygen saturation. see it drops when you are experiencing symptoms. Also get a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. listen to a family member that doesn't have asthma, then listen to yours. listen to yours both at rest a d when you experience symptoms. These tools may help you see whether your problens are real or maybe more anxiety.(#4)Yeah, I had a doctor who almost killed me this way.

"Just got prescribed Breo 100/25, I am a bit scared of the side effects.",1,1.0,7,"(#1)I‚Äôve been on Breo almost 3 years and it‚Äôs been fine for me (double your dose). I do get a bit jittery for about 20 minutes when I take it, so I make sure I take it in the morning and walk around a bit (but that might just be me)(#2)no side effects when i was on it. but also didnt feel it worked. Ended up getting Symbicort HFA instead(#3)People are more likely to report bad side effects and a med not working for them, then not getting any side effects and a med being brilliant, so you can get a really skewed impression by looking at reviews online.

A lot of medication for various conditions, including asthma, is all trial and error to find one that works well for you. What works well for one person might not work well for someone else, and vice versa. The only way to know is to give it a go and see how *you* find it; some side effects only last a short while whilst you first start a medication, others listed with the medication will be really rare, others will be things some people find intolerable and other people don't mind putting up with, and you might not even get any side effects at all.

If it doesn't agree with you (i.e. doesn't work well, gives you side effects you can't tolerate) *then you can stop* and go back to your doctor to discuss trying something else.(#4)The mouth issues people are reporting could be oral thrush. It's important to rinse your mouth out with water after using steroid inhalers like Breo to help prevent this.(#5)I was on Breo for a while and it worked great. I didn‚Äôt have any side effects. I‚Äôm on Trelegy now (it‚Äôs basically Breo plus another medication)."
anyones asthma triggered by strong scents ?,71,1.0,37,"(#1)Yes.

If I smell it, I start having breathing issues(#6)Yep, this is super common.(#7)Scented hand sanitizers are my personal definition of hell.(#8)Yes, absolutely. It doesn't seem to matter if it's a ""pleasant"" smell or not, although if it's artificial in any way it will get me.(#9)I had asthma problems once because a coworker near me was using strong nail polish remover.  I also have been triggered by strong food scents in the office.  Thankfully I am now working from home(#10)Absolutely. Whenever  my sister uses perfume l use my inhaler.(#11)Yes(#12)Me mostly all of Cologne(#13)Absolutely. My latest horror are some of the strongly perfumed, almost incense-like vaping scents. The minute it hits my nose, I know and then when I breathe it in, I start to wheeze. I just got over a really bad asthma exacerbation that was started by one of those scents. My neighbor loves them and it is allowed where I live. Cigarette and cannabis smoke (legal where I live) are also triggers for me.(#14)Me! Perfumes, cigarette smoke, etc triggers my asthma.(#15)Yep. My four triggers: Smoke, icy/cold wind, viruses, and strong scents. Whenever my mom or a date would throw on an excessive amount of perfume it always triggered some irritation; I'd immediately have to get outside or open up a bunch of windows or I end up paying the price.(#16)Yes, perfumes, chemicals, burned things, marijuana, nail polish remover, nail polish, paint, and so much more...(#17)I remember one of my professors hated perfume for this reason(#18)Bleach, strong cleaning chemicals (e.g. KaBoom, CLR, Super Clean etc.), incense, strong candles, people smoking (tobacco and marijuana), paint, and acetone/ nail polish remover. It‚Äôs a miserable life. 

I‚Äôm also triggered by cold air, humidity above a certain range, exercise, viruses, and anything cute and fluffy or feathery.(#19)Candle section anywhere.  1 Whiff of a Marlboro cigarette, one whiff of stanky ass cat shit cigar, one whiff off of a cat shit smelling pipe or hookah, god they stink(#20)Yes. Going from outdoors (cold) to indoors (warm) and vice versa. I once walked in an old-fashioned hardware store and the smell of rubber caused an unstoppable coughing fit. Perfume, on the other hand, is fine. Getting anxious can also make short of breath or provoke a cough.(#21)Perfume is a no-no for me. Always triggers my asthma.(#22)YEP. Meeting rooms at the office are like gas chambers.(#23)Yes.(#24)I HATE perfume sections especially the stores where that's the only entrance. It takes my breath away.(#25)Oh yes. 
I was telling my pulmonologist how my family seems to believe that, because I‚Äôm allergic to their dogs, the best thing to do has to be to soak everything in FABREEZE before I come over (like, to the point where my clothes reek and my hair stinks of it). So, now I‚Äôm itching and wheezing from dogs AND FABREEZE! üòÇ(#26)Absolutely. The laundry detergent/cleaning supplies aisle in the grocery store is the absolute worst.

Nocturnal Asthma,8,1.0,27,"(#1)Wearing an allergy mask to bed helps me if it actually stays on. Some night are better than other I haven‚Äôt found a solid solution yet it mostly just happens to me in winter where I get wake up from it every night(#2)It sounds like your sleeping environment may need to be changed. How often you do wash/change your bedding? How do you clean them, and what detergent do you use? Do you have dust mite covers on your pillows and mattress? 

My allergists have always instructed me to change my bedding at LEAST once a week, and to wash and dry my sheets on a high temp. I was also told to you use a detergent with no scent. The dust mite covers will also need to be washed weekly as well, but they typically aren't washed at the same temps as the rest of the bedding (just read the label).(#3)Nocturnal asthma is a thing. See your doc because you probably need stronger meds. Also, I agree with the folks saying dust may be an issues for you.(#4)Make sure you are not having acid reflux (gerd) that is irritating your airways at night, that ""dust"" feeling in your throat is very suggestive of that. Also, make sure you are not having sleep apnea episodes (specially if youre a loud snorer). Both issues trigger inflammation and both can be happening at the same time specially if overweight. Bring up these possibilities the next time you visit your doctor. Wish you the best!(#5)I wear oxygen to bed(#6)Oh I get this too.

My doctor says gerd. ENT says sinus infection. Pulmonologist says triggered asthma.

None of them can agree and meanwhile I still can't breathe.(#7)I had a lobectomy at 2 weeks old and only really have one functioning lung. Small piece of the other. I went through most of my life without having any asthma symptoms, but after 15 years of smoking weed and one year of living in a gangster ass moldy house, I developed meaningful asthma. It would always come at night time, and would really never be present in the daytime. That was how my asthma journey began. 

Dust can be a trigger for me as well. If my room gets cleaned that day, or if I'm processing vegetable seeds, I'm a vegetable farmer, then I will likely have asthma in the evening time.

The biggest reason that this happens is actually because your body is preparing for sleep by reducing your breathing rate. There's not much that you can do about it. If it feels scary and meaningful, I recommend at least trying to get a prescription for Ventolin, however if this is happening to you every night you should not just be using ventolin to go to sleep, which I did. That devolved into me just using dental in two to three times a night as I woke up every two to three hours with the same breathing problem. You may be looking at a steroid inhaler in your future, which I have had excellent success with. I was hesitant initially as I'd read about some side effects, and had some stigma around the idea of steroids. Symbicort has changed my asthma symptoms in such a meaningful way. I don't have daytime asthma anymore, my capacity to do aerobic exercise and work is back to a place that I'm comfortable, and I'm never waking up at night time to have ventolin. 

Good luck!(#8)This sounds like gerd to me.  Do you ever have a raspy voice?

If you have bad enough gerd, you can actually have aspiration, where you end up inhaling stomach acid... or food or water... whatever's in your stomach.  Obviously this can irritate your lungs and cause a lot of issues.

That or sleep apnea, which can also cause reflux.  Allergies are a possible cause, but if it seems to happen right when you're laying down/falling asleep, I'd assume reflux/apnea.(#9)Nights were always worse. Flovent is amazing though. No more issues."
Viral Induced Wheezing,3,1.0,2,"(#1)It is possible to ""outgrow it"" as the human body is very capable of compensating for problems while still in development. There are a huge number of people who were asthmatics as children but have never had asthma attacks as adults. This is not a certain thing, and it is very important for your child to be evaluated for any underlying condition that might make him extra susceptible to recurrent viral infections and Identifying all the trigger allergens so they can be avoided correctly. 

Asthma means that the lungs are overreacting to some insult, as any of the ones you mentioned. As the lungs go through more and more consecutive episodes of inflammation, its cells adapt for it to attack whatever comes next very aggressively (you can say they become oversensitive). If you manage to control your boy's episodes, further down the line it is possible that the lungs don't react that aggressively and he will not need to be as strongly medicated (less sensitive to overreacting). However once an asthmatic you're always an asthmatic, its just that it is possible to control it to a point that an asthmatic episode is very rare or very far in the past and preventive medications are very minimal or none.

Wish your son the best and Im happy that you are looking for information to help him give his best in life.

sincerely;

An asthmatic med student who is sleep deprived studying for his boards.

Advair and Rescue Inhaler Don‚Äôt Help. What else is there?,4,1.0,14,"(#1)Does the albuterol help immediately at all? If it's doing literally nothing, then it might not (probably isn't) asthma acting up. It could be vocal cord dysfunction, GERD, or LPR.(#2)As you explained that you are on your 30's and it started recently you should really consider further medical examination. ""Adult onset asthma"" as they call it. Is usually because an underlying new problem and it will remit when the issue is solved.

Usually this problem is GERD, specially if you are overweight but there are a plethora of other causes like a new environmental allergen or some occupational exposure. 

That being said, shortness of breath can be caused by COPD or emphysema (which some confuse with athsma but are very different things). Those would be more common to develop after the 20's and have a lot of possible causes. 

I strongly recommend being completely honest with yourself and making completely sure that you are following your treatment correctly and making sure you're not partaking on any activity or behavior that can make your symptoms worse (eg. Smoking, binge eating, exposed to a lot of strong chemical smells without protection, heavily polluted area, etc.). After that, don't stop looking for medical attention until you have a complete diagnostic and they are sure they are treating the correct problem.

As for symptom relief advice, purse breathe for as long as you need when you are feeling out of breath. The main mechanism for shortness of breath in asthmatics and COPD is airway colapse. Using your lips to create resistance as the air comes out makes sure there is still some pressure inside and the airway doesn't colapse trapping air inside (feeling of tight chest is getting more air in than you can get out because of this). Make sure to stay very hydrated and take chest expectorants until you are sure there is no more mucus stuck. This may take a long while, but you can do it!

As a fellow asthmatic I feel your frustration and wish you the best. Don't give up your life is going to feel a lot brighter when you control it.(#3)Got to an asthma and allergy specialist. I was put on Breo ellipta and it helped(#4)There's a lot of different inhalers out there. I can't do the steriod in advair or breo. Just makes me worse. I'm on symbicort currently. Go to an asthma or allergy Dr(#5)Sounds like you need to practise your breathing technique. Some breathing problems are caused by NOT breathing out enough so eventually your lungs are full.  You need to consciously breath out to a count and only breath in the same count, many panic attacks occur as people find they can‚Äôt breath in - because their lungs are already full.
Inhaler technique is also very important, again breath out a lot more than you think. Use your diaphragm  and stomach muscles.
Go to an asthma clinic not a general doctor. In the uk, most doctors have asthma clinics(#6)If the rescue does not work, it may not. be asthma but one of the things that mimic asthma like GERD/LPR/silent reflux.(#7)You may have a flair that a zpack can settle but everything is pointing you towards a doctor. Go to a specialist and start there."
Heart Rate Increase,3,1.0,1,"(#1)I wouldn't use it. Just let the Advair and pred do the job. If you need it still after your HR has calmed down, then use the neb again."
Does Budesonide really help?,4,0.75,23,"(#1)Yea, please give your child hos medication. Children die from uncontrolled asthma.(#2)It‚Äôs really good and the steroid load is minimal. It really helps. Identify triggers, teach him to avoid them and never ever smoke.(#3)Daily use of maintenance medication is the thing that gets asthma under control. I know you are probably scared about putting your kid on medication permanently, but I think it's time to readjust your expectations and realize that asthma is life altering and will likely affect many aspect of your kid's life, and therefore your life. 

For example, you'll need to find out his asthma triggers and eliminate as many of them as possible. For me, my triggers are pets, seasonal allergies, strong smells, excercise, dust, smoke and wood fires, and quite a few more. You can imagine how avoiding all these things can really alter the activities I can do and the places I can go. Between avoiding as many triggers as possible, and taking two types of asthma meds for maintenance (once which I have to inject into myself), and one for flair ups, my asthma is manageable. 

When I was a kid, my mom has the same feelings as you. She didn't want me on meds constantly from a young age, and so she only had me take my rescue inhaler when it got really bad. As a result, I was hospitalized for asthma serval times as a child and developed bronchitis and pneumonia about 4 times each. Please pull out the stops for your kid and learn as much as you can about asthma. And most importantly, follow your kid's doctor's advice. When they tell you to give your child preventative medicine: give him the preventative medicine. It could be much, much worse if you don't.(#4)As scary as corticosteroids sound, they really are the standard treatment and have been around for a long time. Systemic steroid treatment was used in the 50s. Inhaled corticosteroids have been used for 30+ years. I'm sure there must be people on here who have used them long term. 

While inhaled corticosteroids for prevention and albuterol for flair ups are pretty standard, there are different types. If one isn't working great or is too difficult to administer bring it to his doctor's attention and they can help you.

It may take a while to find a routine that works well but don't lose hope. Also, don't stop a medication without the doc's say so. Plenty of people get better with a controller med and think they are cured but it's the medicine doing what it's supposed to do. Untreated asthma can cause lung damage.

Idk about any exact parent groups but this site has links to a whole bunch of info and parent resources.

Best of luck(#5)Seriously. I was 2 when diagnosed. I remember being 7 and a kid in my brother's boy scout troop (he was 8) had to be hospitalized for a severe asthma attack and didn't have meds for. The kid almost died. Give your child the medicine. 
I want you to think about the last time you were so congested in your chest that it was difficult to breathe; that's what it's like for someone with asthma- there's a tightness and it makes it difficult to breathe properly. The medicine helps us to breathe normally. I assume you want your child to breathe; worry less about giving him ""so much medicine,"" worry more about if he is able to breathe.(#6)Yes a preventative inhaler made a huge difference to our son (5 this week) this is the first year he hasn‚Äôt been hospitalized with a respiratory illness. He hasn‚Äôt needed a rescue inhaler apart from when visiting a house full of cat hair. Running around outside no longer triggers an attack. It‚Äôs life altering.(#7)Yes budesonide works exceptionally well. Avoiding triggers should be part of the plan too. Cromolyn sodium is also used in the pediatric population for those who wish to avoid steroids. I am switching to it myself, it is slightly less effective but very good side effect profile. If it doesn't work well enough I'll switch back.(#8)If his asthma is bad, it's better to be on meds than have him suffer. You can always take him off it or switch to something else if it isn't making a difference.(#9)Yes and yes. Preventing an attack is just as important as treating one if not more. I also take those two meds though for me it started in my 30s.(#10)If you are concerned perhaps get a second opinion.  It‚Äôs possible your child could be a borderline case.(#11)Yes! Budesonide is fantastic! it's also the best ICS against covid."
Anyone here take Symbicort?,2,1.0,5,"(#1)Depending on how mild your asthma is, Symbicort might be able to relieve your asthma without having to use it on a daily schedule, rather using it as a ‚Äúrescue‚Äù like Ventolin/albuterol. 

I used to be a Ventolin junkie until my doc switched me to Symbicort and I very rarely need to use it anymore. Maybe 2-3x/week maximum and often none at all. 

Also, I still would still HIGHLY recommend Symbicort but for future reference, you should look into if your insurance company allows you to request ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù medications that are not usually covered but can be if you demonstrate a history of previously covered meds that you‚Äôve been prescribed and taken and yet haven‚Äôt helped you effectively alleviate the problem sufficiently.

If that is the case, there will usually be a form that your dr will have to fill out that lists past meds and recommends the desired non-covered medication that they feel would be beneficial to you.

Best of luck(#2)What dose are you on? They will often start you on a lower dose and then change if you need an extra boost. There are two dosages of Symbicort, I believe. 

I went from Flovent to Symbicort a couple of years ago. Flovent wasn‚Äôt doing as much for me at that point, I was having to use my relief albuterol inhaler more and more. I went to an allergist for some help with my allergies. He started me on Symbicort and it made much more of a difference. I wasn‚Äôt able to continue with allergy shots due to covid making a mess of things visit wise, and my asthma is worse when my allergies are worse. Anyway, I was on the 160/4.5 dose at this point after a couple of years and back to using my relief inhaler more and more. Symbicort doesn‚Äôt go up any further in dosage, so my regular doctor started me on Breztri. I saw a difference pretty quickly and didn‚Äôt need to use the albuterol. Breztri is actually the same two meds as Symbicort but with an additional med added. However, it made my throat really scratchy and made me so hoarse I could barely talk and   answering calls and dealing with things at my job and at home was affected. I followed the instructions to wash out my mouth, etc and gave it a couple of months but nothing changed. So I stopped it, resumed Symbicort for a while and the side effects went away. Gave it a couple of months and tried the Breztri again, same side effects. So I‚Äôm back to Symbicort. 

Check your dose. It was a good med for me for a couple of years.(#3)Symbicort works better for me than Dulera. You may need to experiment to find what works best for you.(#4)Dulera slightly cheaper at canadian international pharmacies."
Am I the only one that gets terrified kf having asthma?,2,0.75,8,"(#1)Not really. I've had asthma since I was 4 or 5, had a fair share of asthma attacks since then - a few without inhalers. I don't generally carry a rescue inhaler on me anymore, and I suppose my asthma is ""under control"" enough that I don't need a regular asthma regime (or I could just be ignoring it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). That being said, I've learn what my triggers are, have learn to recognize my symptoms, and know what to do if an attack occurs - particularly in the event I don't have an inhaler on me, so having an asthma attack sucks, but doesn't really scare me. Also, I've learned that panicking and or having anxiety during an asthma attack makes things 1000x worse, so being calm during an asthma attack is super beneficial.(#2)Nah. I was born with it so.. life is fairly normal for me to have it. That being said, I‚Äôm now in my 30‚Äôs and am mostly in control. When I am not, I carry my rescue inhaler. My roommate and my gf  are aware of my medication mix in case something happens but I have yet to have needed someone to administer for me since I was a child. 

Just take your daily. Take it every day by the script and avoid your triggers the best you can.(#3)Not in the slightest. I've been dealing with this for most of my life and I'm almost 60 now.(#4)Absolutely yes. I am sometimes still terrified of falling asleep because I used to wake up in the middle of the night, hardcore choking. One time, I even thought that was it‚Ä¶ Its much better now as I got diagnosed and use meds, but just the thought of it still haunts me. Hang in there brother, believe its gonna get better.(#5)i never used to even when i had to go to the er.  but after my last severe attack where i was almost put on a vent, i have major anxiety about it."

Wondering if I might be experiencing asthma?,2,1.0,8,"(#1)You should definitely see a doctor. Asthma can start at any age. It also doesn't necessarily stop you from breathing completely; I've had asthma my whole life and I've never even been hospitalized for it. Some people have mild asthma that goes unnoticed for quite a while because it isn't always the stereotypical coughing and wheezing.(#2)Asthma can be different for everyone from what I‚Äôve noticed, a lot of my asthma is allergenic and when I get worked up and it only started happening in the past few months and I‚Äôm only 18, best thing you can do is go talk to a doctor and maybe get a true diagnosis and they may prescribe you a puffer or something(#3)I really encourage you to talk to your dad about seeing a doctor, or talk to your school nurse. It could be asthma or it could be something else or even nothing at all, but you deserve answers and health care!(#4)None of us are doctors, but you pretty accurately described asthma symptoms.  Definitely talk to your doctor.  If you aren‚Äôt exactly sure how to do that end you don‚Äôt want to bring it up with your dad, your school nurse or councilor is probably a good start.  

Some things that might help if indeed it‚Äôs asthma: sipping warm water (helps to relax your chest), anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen, breathing long and slow in through your nose and out through your mouth.(#5)You need to ask your parents to make a doctor's appointment for you.(#6)Had the ""worst asthma"" my doctor had ever seen in his office.

Don't know if I should the albuterol again",3,0.81,5,"(#1)I don‚Äôt remember the maximum amount they recommend per day‚Ä¶ but my doctor frequently reminds me that in the case of a crisis, use it as much as needed to be able to breathe(#2)If you have a nebulizer you're already on montelukast for exercise-induced asthma attacks right?"
Unusual symptoms,7,1.0,13,"(#1)When my asthma starts to flare up I get really bad back ache. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but it‚Äôs like high up, in between my shoulder blades. I‚Äôve Googled it, but never really found a definitive answer why asthma causes back pain. It tends to be one of the first symptoms of a flare up or that an attack is likely. Once my asthma has calmed down, the back pain completely disappears. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs to do with inflammation or pleurisy maybe? I think it‚Äôs unusual.(#2)Yeah I did.  I ran out of ventolin (two puffers emptied) and I couldn‚Äôt walk a step without feeling like someone was stepping on a hose. If I stood still I could get a little oxygen in. If I took one step someone was stepping on that hose. It was terrifying. I had to call 911 to just get home.  In hindsight it‚Äôs so ominous because three weeks later I had a near-fatal asthma attack and was intubated in the ICU.

I don‚Äôt wish the symptom on anyone but I‚Äôd love to talk to anyone who has.(#3)Not the weirdest, but I sometimes have cough variant asthma. Not always. But when I do, it starts with a small cough from what feels like an itch in my throat, and it can vary all the way to coughing until I vomit.(#4)one time after a day of flying i was just totally sick, never felt so bad. I assume it was the 20 hours of cold, dry air from the plane combined with the mask and lack of sleeping. shortness of breath & cough are normal for me, but this was also body aches, chills, etc.(#5)Extreme lower leg pain after. Like my legs will be in so much pain that if I try to run they'll just start burning.(#6)nausea lol"
Tested positive a month ago and still having shortness of breath. Anyone have helpful advice?,4,1.0,7,"(#1)I had SOB both times from COVID for about 3-4 months after the infection. Fatigue and SOB were bad up to 3 months after then started to taper off.(#2)Go back and see your doc again. You might need more than 5 days of pred, or a stronger maintenance med.(#3)had a similar experience (not covid tho unless i had a false negative PCR). had a cold/flu, bad symptoms for just a day or so, but the fallout was really frustrating for my asthma. lots of coughing and shortness of breath.   


couldn't get a hold of my pulmo but my primary doc helped me. 5 day course of prednisone, plus some random various meds to help with cough (OTC and one Rx, was benzonatate capsules). OTC stuff was guafenesin and DM. non-medicine wise, tons of steam, hot tea, sleep, and anything to reduce life stress were all helpful.  


this was the longest asthma exaggeration ive ever had, it was like 3days of being sick plus 4w of shortness of breath. realistically i probably should of gone on prednisone right away or something, i need to work with my pulmo for a plan on this.(#4)I'm the same timeline as you almost, got it on 22/12/21, recovered by the 1/4/22 or so and was feeling pretty good but weak for a few days there (still + on PCR test a few days after it). I was vaxxed and COVID was chill, I barely had to use albuterol.

Aaand since then my allergies and asthma have been creeping up to overdrive, and I suffer walking up a flight of stairs. I used to be a hobby jogger, that's not very doable anymore either.

Here to read those success stories because the past month has been a living hell of waking up and coughing for 30 minutes and then my airways annoying me all day. I don't remember the last time my asthma was this out of control for this long.(#5)ask for an inhaler for a month or 2"
Scented candles?,3,1.0,3,"(#1)Basically, look for anything without volatile organic compounds. Benzene and toluene are especially bad with asthma. Def avoid essential oils too because they ARE volatile organic compounds. 

I‚Äôve found a few candles from bath and body works that don‚Äôt take me out, but I normally need to be on like the other side of the room when they‚Äôre burning and only leave it going for like 10-20 minutes. The one I‚Äôm using right now without major issues is called Harvest Pomegranate if you‚Äôd like to check it out.(#2)I don't allow scented anything in my house. If I want a nice smell, I simmer some cinnamon sticks/cloves/etc."
"Saw a pulmonologist today for mild asthma, went directly to Advair 500/50, is this normal?",1,1.0,4,"(#1)Probably best to clarify with the doc. If you‚Äôre quite symptomatic right now, they may be giving a larger dose to start and then taper down . But, it‚Äôs still best to ask for your situation. 

For the Ventolin, also check if you should be using it before exercise - it would be helpful if you have trouble when exercising.(#2)Seems kinda high to me. I always start low and go higher if I can handle it. I literally contact my doctor's and request a smaller dose. I have had some nasty side effects from taking a normal dose of long term inhalers.

Why they started you on the highest dose seems illogical to me.(#3)Seems on the high side for mild asthma. She may step it down once the inflammation is under control.

The rescue inhaler is SOP. Ideally, if your asthma is in control, you should rarely ever need to use it."
Asthmatic endurance athletes,18,0.95,46,"(#1)Im not, but its awesome you are doing it!(#2)Became a long distance runner in my 50s. Currently starting training for a duathlon.(#3)Could I ask, has the training helped your asthma symptoms? My asthma seemed much better controlled when I exercised regularly in the past.(#4)I'm in my 20s and I adore hiking, I wanna get into good enough shape to go back packing but it's like I get close then I get bronchitis or something and it set my asthma back to level 0(#5)Yes!

After my entire childhood and teenage years avoiding any and all kinds of exercise like the plague, I got really into long distance running and hiking in my 20s. Good to see there's more of us!(#6)I‚Äôve been a swimmer all my life but only had asthma about 3/4 years(#7)Ultrarunner and lifter here. 30M and just diagnosed this year.

I have never had an attack so bad I was in the hospital. I've had pneumonia and sicknesses that bad where my O2 was low but that was about it. 

I have allergic asthma for the most part. Which sucks when I run in nature during certain times of the year.(#8)I had chronic asthma as a kid.  In/out of hospital at times.  Inhaler almost every day in middle school.  I started Triathlon and endurance sports when I turned 20.  Ironically, my asthma symptoms disappeared after a few months of training.  

I'm 32 now and my symptoms return when I stop training.  I've had my VO2Max tested and increasing cardiovascular strength thru training seems to be the only thing that helps my asthma.(#9)Long distance backpacking. I've done about 100 miles over four days before.(#10)I ran cross country (5k) in highschool. All I can say is carry your inhaler and if you need to stop stop. Your coach would rather have you alive than dead(#11)I‚Äôm a huge fan of long hikes now! I think my longest is 12 miles but im planning on going for 15 in the spring! I was undiagnosed for a pretty long time so I think it‚Äôs because I got really used to working out with basically no air lmao! Free high altitude training I guess?

My asthma generally isn‚Äôt a problem unless it‚Äôs really steep and above like 5000‚Äô? I do have a mesh nebulizer I bring with me on long hikes in case I have a serious issue, never had to use it though.(#12)Road cyclist here! Not quite an endurance athlete, but working towards it. Didn‚Äôt start real exercise until I was 40. I‚Äôm now 49 and am training to do a 300 mile cross-state ride. Asthma is definitely a consideration in my planning as I have to make sure I avoid very cold temperatures and take appropriate meds when certain plants are blooming, but exercise has hugely helped my lung health.(#13)ran XC and track in HS, was rough but my PRs were 5:02 mile and 18 min 5k(#14)I've been a distance runner and hiker since I was a teenager.(#15)I like to say I'm the only person to bike from Boston to Amherst with a nebulizer in my backpack (about 100 miles). One of those things where plenty of people bike 100 miles, and plenty of people have  a nebulizer, but very few of them do both. And if they did it'd be in a legit bag attached to their bike not a crappy backpack. I'm talking the old school neb as well, not the portable mesh one. 

Turns out I didn't need it but I wanted it with me just in case and I couldn't afford inhalers without insurance back then.(#16)I play soccer. Was previously at a very high level if that counts. Can run, swim and lift with the best of em. Just need to be consistent with the inhaler and it never comes.(#17)[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/10/151007140619.htm#:\~:text=%22Just%2030%20minutes%20a%20day,shortness%20of%20breath%20and%20attacks](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/10/151007140619.htm#:~:text=%22Just%2030%20minutes%20a%20day,shortness%20of%20breath%20and%20attacks).

""Just 30 minutes a day: Regular exercise relieves asthma symptoms  
Those who undertake physical activity year round breathe easier"" article from Science Daily about the potential for exercise to relieve asthma symptoms.(#18)Used to be. Loved swimming and hiking. Swimming was always recommended by doctors because it's great for training the lungs.

Started training for triathlon and completed a sprint triathlon. Unfortunately I then developed anther illness that means I can't do any of it.(#19)I‚Äôve learned I can handle high altitude hiking (better than many) and running amazingly well after really shitty asthma most of my life.  Couldn‚Äôt do any running in my younger years."
How do you guys avoid morning cough?,5,0.86,11,"(#1)Are you taking any sort of allergy medications? I am assuming that the reason that your cough is productive is because you have drainage from allergies, and that drainage is trickling down to your lungs at night and irritating them. I have the same issue, and I use Zyrtec and Flonase daily, and Benadryl and Mucinex as needed to dry up my sinuses.(#2)Ask your doctor about a prescription for Singulair (montelukast), it may help with that.  Also you need to try to get your bedroom as clear as possible of potential allergens.  Looks into getting a new pillow, make sure your sheets are clean, and if you have an older spring mattress look into replacing it, you can also put a hypoallergenic mattress protector over it.  If you have pets that sleep with you, kick them out for a few nights after you clean up everything real well and see if that makes a difference.(#3)Humidifier?(#4)You may need a daily controller medication. Singulair as a pill is one lots of people like, but nowadays it‚Äôs not a first line med bc some people get bad mood symptoms. Flovent inhaler twice daily is another good one.(#5)Hoover your pillow & mattress. Dust mite faeces causes allergies. I have my mattress a few years, hoovered it at high strength with the Dyson Animal and couldn‚Äôt believe what came off it. Might not be a silver bullet but we‚Äôre looking for marginal gains.(#6)Raise the head of your bed so you don't sleep flat. These are special bed wedges for this but easiest way to try it is put pillows or a rolled up duvet under your mattress.(#7)You may also have GERD. It's a common culprit with the coughing. As someone said, try sleeping with your head and shoulders elevated.(#8)Singulair."
"Very ""irritable"" lungs and poorly-controlled asthma. Help?",7,1.0,18,"(#1)I'm allergic to everything also. I have no eye watering or typical allergy symptoms. I do have a cough and my lungs are irritated all the time also. It gets worse in the summers for me. I notice sometimes my longer term I halers like Simbicort makes me worse. You could ask your doctor to try something different and even ask them about singular it's a allergy\asthma medication that could help maybe.

I get this vibration issue also when I cough and pound on my chest. I'm allergic to everything also. Try getting a HEPA filter air purifier in your home and see if that helps.

Ps. I used to have normal allergy symptoms and then I developed lung issues when I turned 25 due to allergies. Normal allergies disappeared and only lung issues remained.

Also you could try taking Omeprazole and see if your getting acid reflux. Cut back on soda and anything that causes heart burn it makes asthma worse. - ask your doctor.(#2)Test is better than mine! Looks good but these never accurately show asthma severity at every point in time.(#3)Sounds like your symptoms tend more towards the inflammation side of the spectrum than constriction. That vibration sound you hear might be the rattle of fluid moving around in your airways. Do you have a nebulizer at home? I find that helps my coughs become more productive, whereas the inhaler doesn‚Äôt do much for that dry feeling. Not sure what type of climate you live in but a humidifier might be helpful too. It can be exhausting coughing all of that gunk up, but better out than in.

Are you taking any oral antihistamines like Zyrtec or Allegra? Also, how long have you been on your current routine? My doctor usually has me switch mine up every few years. It might be time to rotate to another long acting bronchodilator and steroid combination and a new nasal steroid. I currently take Flovent (switched about two years ago after taking Advair for a while), Flonase, Zyrtec, Singulair, and prescription eyedrops for my allergies. I hope you can get a check-up soon and get some relief.(#4)Does vibrating sound come from your airways(bronchial tree) when you exhale hard or forcefully? Do you feel breathlessness on exertion or in doing any activity?"
Inhaler,1,1.0,1,"(#1)Vannair is just a different name for Symbicort. I've used this in the past, and had no issues."
Do I have asthma or not. Left results are pre covid in 2020. Middle results are 1.5 months post covid pneumonia. Last results are from last Friday. The middle one is best but I also lost a ton of weight from the pneumonia I think that's why my numbers were much better. Gained my weight back lol üòÜ,5,0.73,27,"(#1)The numbers alone are not sufficient to diagnose you with asthma, though they can certainly outline (and do here) many breathing difficulties, which can result from bronchial infection(s), allergies, asthma... or all of the above. Also, you have not outlined your symptoms over time and any medications.(#2)If you were breathing better when you lost weight then your symptoms may be more weight related than asthma.(#3)My numbers were perfectly fine, but I was diagnosed with asthma based on symptoms. It sounds like you're in the same boat. I was diagnosed by an allergist who has determined I have a very mild allergy to oaks and horses, and neither are really triggering my asthma. The oaks might be triggering in pollen season. She said that I should take preventive meds to prevent future damage to my lungs. Asthma untreated is a progressive disease and the more scarring a damage you get now, the worse your lung function will get over time. 

I went to a wedding this past weekend. It was outside (Florida), but we were having record cold temps and the next day, I was wheezing. So apparently cold is one of my triggers.(#4)You stated some of my results show breathing difficulties which ones? Thanks"
"Was on Brezti, but it's stopped working and it's way too expensive for me, what other meds are out there for resistant asthma?",3,1.0,2,"(#1)There is a zero dollar copay card from the manufacturer. Also, per my pulm, Breztri is like maxing out in asthma meds.  Next step would be biologics. I‚Äôm getting blood work done tomorrow to see if I qualify for them."

Yo am I gonna die,2,0.75,14,"(#1)You won't die in your sleep, you will wake up if it gets that bad. It's actually easier to breathe in your sleep than when awake since alot of inflammation goes down while asleep. 

You definitely need to get on controller mods. Sounds like something to talk to your doctor with tomorrow. Should probably ask them to refer you to a pulmonologist also. If the ER sent you home it means they didn't think you were in immediate danger. You can also ask for prednisone to hold you over until the controller meds kick in but all of this is up to your doctor. Again, really should try to get in with a pulmonologist they know alot more than regular docs.

Lastly, obviously smoking is bad. You may die if you continue that. Could cause an asthma attack and kill you suddenly or will just kill you slowly.(#2)Go back to the ER and ask for a nebulizer. Ask them if they think you need a short dose of oral steroids, and then follow up with your primary care physician to see about controller meds like Advair. 

And stop smoking that shit. No use beating yourself up about it while you‚Äôre sick since that will add to your stress and anxiety, but once you‚Äôre well you can take some time to develop more healthy ways to manage stress. Or even just replace it with another once in a while vice that doesn‚Äôt trigger your asthma, like an edible. 

In the meantime, try to stay calm, take a hot shower with lots of steam, drink some coffee / tea, and go get checked out again. You got this.(#3)Your going to be fine just take it easy. The more you get worked up the worse your asthma can get. When you can't breath you get anxiety is a vicious cycle.(#4)Oh yeah I also don't get jittery from Ventolin?? Like it takes 6 puffs to make me jittery. Not that I usually take 6 puffs. Rn I've used it every couple of hours and sometimes every hour.(#5)I realise I'm a dumb ass I have really bad medical anxiety but relapsed on smoking tobacco Im kinda freaking out a bit(#6)Use your inhaler when you need it. If it isn‚Äôt helping, or if you‚Äôre using it 4 times a day or more, see a doctor to get on a daily controller medication.(#7)I wonder if your lung troubles might be allergy induced? You specifically mentioned the rain, and rain can sort of kick up certain bacteria and dust into the air. Have you considered trying an otc antihistamine to see of that helps calm down the issue? Might be worth a try to eliminate one potential trigger."
Alvesco not working?,5,1.0,10,"(#1)for me i am on flovant . it took quite a while to see it working . alvesco is a steroid inhaler right ?(#2)Alvesco doesn't sound like the med for you. If Symbicort controlled your symptoms, why did your doctor switch you to Alvesco?(#3)I‚Äôm on it. I‚Äôve been on it for months now. It didn‚Äôt work for me at the low dose (once a day), so now I‚Äôm on 2 puffs twice a day. It‚Äôs still not really working and my peak flow is 20-30% below what it was before I switched meds. My asthma has never been this bad. I don‚Äôt know why my doctor insists on this medicine, but I‚Äôm going back next week, and I‚Äôll try to get switched to something else. I‚Äôm also on Serevent.

What dose are you on?(#4)I *was* on Alvesco and symbicort 400 and spiolto.

Since changed to Fostair and now changed again to Trimbow.

The Trimbow is meant to be 2 puffs twice a day, but I'm taking 2 puffs three times a day at the moment to get by (and not have to prop up with prednisolone). Have a review with specialist this morning, he not going to be happy ;)"
Question: what does asthma fee like to you?,54,0.96,90,"(#1)My sinuses start to get irritated and then my throat feels like it's squeezing kinda. My chest gets heavy and I cough alot. It also progresses into feeling kinda faint and spacy also. It's fun...

Environmental allergic asthma style...(#2)Tightness in my chest. Then I try cough to clear the restriction but it does nothing so I end up in a bit coughing fit that makes me very tired.

When my asthma is really bad I breathing very shallow.(#3)Drowning in my own mucous.  Spastic coughing. Next few days after the attack are kind of painful in my chest and tired.(#4)I get a lot of chest tightness, pain, and cramping. I started out thinking I was fat and out of shape, but it turns out the chest pain and shortness of breath was not normal at all. It was a sign of a clincal problem (asthma). It was confirmed with a PFT (spirometry or pulmonary function test). Meds have helped a lot.(#5)I developed asthma in my mid 30's during pregnancy, so I vividly remember what it feels like to have normal lungs.

I say all the time ""I miss not having to think about breathing"". I'm on Symbicort daily and it for the most part keeps the worst symptoms at bay but my lungs don't feel normal anymore. Even when they're in decent shape it's like I catch myself thinking about how they're a little tight. I don't typically have asthma attacks, I've had 2 in the last 4 years, but any kind of cold or respiratory infection and its like someone is sitting on my chest and all I can do all day is think about my breathing and hope it doesn't get worse. Any kind of cold has a 50/50 shot of landing me on prednisone and antibiotics. 

I love my youngest son but damn do I wish I still had normal lungs.(#6)Heavy and tight chest, shallow breath, wheezing, itchy eyes, itchy throat, sneezing, coughing and sometimes itchy back.(#7)Non attack days? Just the forever wheeze. 

When I get an attack it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm being choked by a hand from the inside out. I can‚Äôt breathe out, I can‚Äôt breathe in anymoee, then queue panic attack(#8)Grab one of those coffee stir straws and breathe thru it after jogging in place for 30 seconds.  That's a similar feeling.(#9)My throat and lungs feel like its burning accompanied by the feeling of brinks piling on top of your chest(#10)It depends on what caused it. If it just happens for whatever unknown reason, my lungs feel tight and uncomfortable. When it is caused by exercise/laughing, I get wheezy. During pregnancy, I've had this annoying extra symptom where I feel like I constantly need to clear my throat. Asthma can present in many different ways. Surprisingly, I hardly ever actually cough.(#11)When I exhale it sounds like mice having an argument and the sounds wake me up all night. Then I‚Äôm exhausted all day because I hardly slept which doesn‚Äôt help me get much better. It feels like breathing through a straw and it gets me very emotional and frustrated. If it‚Äôs from bronchitis I feel like I‚Äôm drowning and my chest feels so very heavy and I wish I could get a special vacuum and get it all out! I‚Äôve had it since I was a baby and I just turned 50. Wish they would find a cure(#12)To me it feels like air hunger (I can‚Äôt get enough air or the lungs can‚Äôt expand, I don‚Äôt know). The chest and back also hurt, sometimes I have white mucus as well. During a life threatening attack it feels like breathing through a straw(#13)The feeling of your lung capacity shrinking with every breath(#14)It starts as an itchy, scratchy, kind of fuzzy tightness in my upper chest.  Usually a difficulty getting in a good deep breath.  As I struggle to breathe it gets worse.  My breaths get shorter and shallower, and that sets into a cycle.  I struggle and strain to breathe, which exacerbates the asthma attack, which makes it harder to breathe, so I struggle more, etc.(#15)Tightness in my chest, like someone has strapped down my lungs with belts, wheezing, and lots of extra mucus(#16)My lungs feel irritated like itchy and scratchy and sometimes like there‚Äôs a ball in there. Tightness and like I can‚Äôt take a full breathe in. I try to cough to see if I can get phlegm out but usually nothing comes out.

When I lay down it feels like someone is sitting on my chest and I struggle to breathe well.(#17)I get the feeling like someone is sitting on my chest, that tightness(#18)When I need my inhaler I feel like im breathing every single air particle but it‚Äôs useless for a comfortable breathing pattern.It‚Äôs a similar feeling to being congested with boogers in your throat but the difference is clear you can‚Äôt breath as full a breath. An analogy I think of often is *A fish without water grasping for the tank it maged to jump out of.*(#19)Bad asthma attack feels like someone takes my lungs out, beats them with a baseball bat, then puts them back in my chest. Plus extremely fatigued.(#20)Feels like a heavy weight is on your chest, preventing you from getting a full breath in. 

I've had asthma my whole life, so don't remember what the start felt like.(#21)It gives me a lot of back pain and it's difficult to breathe out. I'll get a cough and have trouble walking any distance because I'm out of breath. This makes breathing in feel really difficult because I feel like there's already air on but I still need it. This is when it was really bad but luckily it's well controlled now.(#22)When mines real bad it feels like im breathing throurh like a milkshake . i get shortness of breath and chest pain . those are my worst symptoms and of corse coughing but that can be relieved with a rescue inhaler . Those other symptoms i mentioned lol nothing can be done(#23)I always explained it to non-asthmatic friends like this: put your hand tight over your mouth, make a very very small space between your fingers, now breathe through it, if you can. Also, your windpipe is full of gunk.(#24)For me it feels like I've a very very dry throat.. To a point where I am choking and simultaneously my chest feels very heavy and it feels like no air is going in or out no matter how hard I try.
I know it's too bad when I feel like I'll pass out.(#25)If you think you have symptoms, go see. doctor for evaluation.(#26)It feels like 50% of my breath is locked, like DLC from EA games. Also sometimes it feels like a circle is getting tighter and tighter in my throat.(#27)So. Much. Phlegm.(#28)Chest tightness and nonstop coughing to the point  where sometimes i‚Äôll almost pass out.(#29)I‚Äôve had life long asthma (diagnosed very young) and I don‚Äôt know life without asthma. My asthma is allergy induced and exercise induced.

For me, the allergy induced asthma comes on slower while the exercise induced comes on very quickly. It starts with a tightness in the center of my chest, just below my thyroid and collar bone. Then I feel a ‚Äútickled irritation‚Äù and I image that‚Äôs the mucus building as my bronchial tubes are tightening. From there, the irritation and bronchial righting increase. At that point I will need a rescue inhaler.

Exercising (even low impact yoga) causes a much more rapid onset. I feel like exercising is more of my bronchial tube tightening and less mucus. 

To prevent attacks I‚Äôm on a daily antihistamine (Xyzal works best for me) and Breo steroid inhaler (the mid-grade dosage) and I pre-dose with my rescue inhaler before exercising.

When I get refills of my rescue inhalers I ask the doctor to double the prescription so I can keep one in my night stand and one in my purse. I‚Äôve been doing this so long that I now have inhalers all over the house in strategic locations: night stand, home office, work office, purse, car, etc. 

If I can ever help you with strategies for managing your asthma, I‚Äôm happy to help. The best thing for me has been working with a doctor that specialized in allergy and immunology.(#30)Tight chest, painful to breathe. I never wheeze.(#31)I‚Äôve had asthma my entire life. Suddenly I cannot exhale fully. I feel like I‚Äôm strangling as my CO2 level increases. I cough and cough but it doesn‚Äôt help. And then I feel like someone is sitting on my chest because I can‚Äôt get any air.

Over the years I‚Äôve learned to not panic. To relax. To force the stale air out of my lungs (even with a modified self Heimlich maneuver ), calm myself, sit or lie down and slowly get over the attack.

I can usually stop it with a shot of Albuterol. But before rescue inhalers were invented, I had to learn those coping skills. (I‚Äôm in my 60‚Äôs)(#32)Depends if I‚Äôm wheezing or not. Wheezing feels like bees in my lungs. When it‚Äôs just constriction, it feels like someone is sitting on my chest.(#33)For me, it‚Äôs chest tightness and wheezing. The wheezing is the worst part, it feels like I‚Äôm trying to breathe through a tiny straw and no matter what, I can‚Äôt get enough air.(#34)it feels like i have to think about every breath during an attack. my muscles feel the strain of taking a deep breath but i still can‚Äôt get any air.(#35)Itchy throat/chest, so much chest tightness and pressure, which can progress to coughing (trying to open and clear up the mucous). I sometimes get upper back pain (lung inflammation), so I‚Äôve starts sleeping on my side. Wheezing when my asthma wasn‚Äôt controlled. Now I‚Äôm on Symbicort twice daily and use a rescue inhaler when symptoms are triggered. I live in a fully carpeted apartment and have dust allergies :(. As of late, I find that scents are also a trigger.(#36)I have two modes;
1. (Cold air trigger- smoke trigger- dry air trigger- strong fragrance trigger) Sudden coughing that won‚Äôt stop until I vomit, take my albuterol or get away from the trigger. Chest tightness 

2. (Illness trigger, possibly stress trigger) My breaths get less and less productive slowly over the course of the day, until it takes 10 breaths to get air one breath should get. I can‚Äôt finish a sentence without taking a breath. My chest is tight and my blood pressure skyrockets(#37)Mine started after I got bronchitis and I had to do a 2 mile jog in the cold of Feb. Chest was really tight, limbs were weak and it felt like no matter how much air I breathed it never felt like enough. 

Eventually went to the middle east, and the air quality was bad and now if it's really cold, or the air is smoky it tends to flair up. 

Similar stuff, now with added slight vision darkening, inability to focus. Tripod position is the only comfortable position, coughing fits, lots of phlegm, and feeling a little weaker. It has gotten better with medication, and more jogging but that is a long long process for jogging.(#38)I just got diagnosed with moderate persistent asthma a day ago which i didn‚Äôt know i had. When breathing only through my nose, oxygen does not go all the way down to my lungs. There is something that‚Äôs not letting me consume 100 amount of air. And the inhaler helps me consume all the air that my lungs need. I‚Äôm so sad cuz i‚Äôm only 20, no one in my family have asthma, i also don‚Äôt have any allergy; i‚Äôm gonna take an allergy test soon tho.(#39)It feels like someone is sitting on my chest waiting for me to die.(#40)I‚Äôve had my asthma since my first pregnancy in 2010. I‚Äôve always had allergies but the lung issue was new to me. My triggers are similar to everyone else. Strong smells of any kind, pollens, dust, animals, and exercise even in small amounts like an easy hike or walking up the stairs. 

My lungs fill up with mucus. I feel like I have a brick on my chest. I‚Äôll cough so hard that I get pin prickly feeling all over my body and especially in my back. It hurts so bad and makes me itchy! I‚Äôve blown the little blood vessels in my eyelids from coughing so hard. Sometimes I even throw up. That‚Äôs when it‚Äôs severe. I learned it‚Äôs a mind game. You have to calm yourself down immediately. Talk to yourself inside your head and breathe slow and low. Arms above your chest may help you as you focus on your little breaths. I like to drink hot coffee when this happens too. The warmth and caffeine seem to help! Of course, I get my emergency inhaler immediately and take 2 to 3 puffs. 

The wheezing can be so bad everyone will keep their distance because they think I‚Äôm super sick. Sometimes I think I need a sign to wear that just states I have asthma not Covid. Lol. I also bought a nebulizer for home. I love it! Means less money spent going to the doctors office. Spriva works great! So does Symbicort. I use both daily. I also have to take monelukast for allergies. I always have prednisone on hand too. If my lungs are so bad that you can hear every breath in and out I know I need additional help. I‚Äôll take prednisone for 2 to 3 days along with all my other inhalers and after that I‚Äôm fixed up for a while till something else triggers me again. But a simple cold turns straight into bronchitis. So I also take Quercetin immune health support vitamins. 

My allergist told me there is a cure. Of course health insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it. It‚Äôs expensive costs but not terrible. It‚Äôs about $10k for all of it. Once I can afford that I will get the shots! Otherwise I‚Äôll just keep paying $700/ month for my inhalers and meds. It‚Äôs crazy we have a cure but our health system won‚Äôt pay for it. They are so greedy!(#41)My lungs wheeze internally and im coughing up alot of phlegm, breathing more heavily, feels like im drowning, throat burns, cant stand the smell of rose perfumes, cant play with the cats, but everythimg else is normal, i can be very active during the day but when i come home i have trouble breathing and living with the cats.
My new to me blankets have lots of dust and are givi.g me asthma attacks ihave to wash them, my sinuses burn everytime i get in bed and cant go to sleep without a puff of albuterol.(#42)during an attack it feels like i‚Äôm being squeezed tight against a wall, or something is sitting on my chest, prior to sprinting for 10 hours straight, coughing up phlegm nonstop, freaking out bc my medication isn‚Äôt working, all while having a mental breakdown bc i think im gonna die üôÉ 

but on a ‚Äúregular‚Äù day i‚Äôll have moments where i have to remember be cautious of what i eat or drink, (even though it‚Äôs pretty ingrained in my mind, how much i can or can‚Äôt push my body and taking medications as soon as i wake up and before i sleep.(#43)So very difficult to catch my breath. The worse my attacks get the harder it is to breathe normally(#44)Environmental/allergic and exercise induced. It feels like somebody is adding cotton balls into my windpipe, bit by bit. First it's just a little cotton, so the air moves slower, but it's still moving. As the attack progresses, it's like they're adding more and more cotton until almost no air can pass through.(#45)A pain in the ass I‚Äôve had asthma since I was a baby and I can‚Äôt do the things I love like running or swimming because the simplest things trigger it and it hurts so much when I can‚Äôt breathe it‚Äôs never gotten better only gets worse I wish it would go away I had dreams of joining the army but now that‚Äôs ruined(#46)For me, it feels like this:

It begins in my throat, which feels like it's closing up.

Then, the spot right in between the bottom of breast bone will get super super tight.

Then, my chest will start to feel like there's something on it. 

After all of that starts, I'll begin to take deep breaths to make sure I'm still breathing and can still breathe. Most times I can breathe fine, but it'll feel uncomfortable. No wheezing, no coughing, no dizziness for me. Just that terrible, uncomfortable feeling. 

This is when I take my rescue inhaler.

And all of that goes away within 15-20 minutes. 

It's the absolute WORST fucking feeling ever. It's usually pretty bad if I'm around my triggers. It was TORTURE when I used to drink beer, wine, and dark liquor, since I have allergic asthma. It's also pretty bad if I pet a dog, get exposed to pollen, dust, or rubber from car tires at a dealership. Cats and chlorine (since I'm a swimmer/lifeguard) are mild triggers for me. Usually not much of a problem.(#47)The wheezing sound starts. Interestingly I never cough when I‚Äôm having an actual asthma attack. I typically have a productive cough but that stops when I have an asthma attack. If my lungs are like a meter, every breath I take feels like the meter is only a quarter full as opposed to a normal breath which would make the meter 100% full. After some time of labored breathing my lower back starts aching as well.

My allergies subside when I have asthma too. It‚Äôs as if my body is too distracted to deal with allergies üòÖ(#48)Depends how bad it is. When it‚Äôs really bad: i can feel my airways sticking together, and I can feel my lungs fighting itself to breathe in and out. turning me into the human whistle. Also my back starts hurting a lot. Have to swallow a lot. While I don‚Äôt get coughing my instincts tell me to cough and it just doesn‚Äôt make it better."
Mystery diagnosis.,24,0.91,52,"(#1)Mold put me in the hospital. Maybe she‚Äôs allergic?(#2)I don‚Äôt know anything, but I didn‚Äôt develop asthma until early middle school. Can you see an allergist?(#3)Maybe she is being exposed to mold or something at school(#4)Thank you I will! I wasn‚Äôt aware she even had asthma until she had these spells‚Ä¶ when she was two her doctor said she developed bronchitis from her asthma. She‚Äôs been on Zyrtec and singulair since! Now add on Flovent and albuterol (which I rarely ever use or need Thank God). But the other doc she‚Äôs seeing now agreed something is triggering it. She goes for a consult to an allergist on the 11th. I‚Äôm hoping I get some answers.(#5)I‚Äôm sorry that you are experiencing this. Please update with what you find out.(#6)This sounds horrible so sorry. It sounds to me like maybe two things are going on- exacerbated asthma maybe caused by sleeping environment like dust mite allergy and then separately catching minor colds (from kids at Church?) that provide an extra viral trigger to the asthma. My son (5 this week) experiences both and his pulmonologist said colds can be worse than covid for little ones. I think the flovent/flonase will help tremendously. We now have some prednisone on hand for flare ups after some hospitalizations and an asthma action plan about when to use. Do you have a nebulizer? I have been encouraged to use instead of rescue inhaler whenever we are home especially when LO is already sick (e.g. has fever). Also helpful to work on bedroom triggers- setting a max limit on snugglies in bed, boil wash bedding, allergy covers on pillow and mattress etc.. honestly it‚Äôs exhausting and at times expensive but after 5 months on flovent we have really seen the difference. Good luck!(#7)My son has Down's Syndrome.   Weakened immune system and more prone to respiratory illnesses.  


When he started preschool he was constantly sick, we'd send him back after only a few days thinking he was well enough, and he'd just be worse again within a week.  By kindergarten he developed pneumonia from it.  


What we were told is that there are small viruses every where, the classrooms are already infected, and kids will bring in more from their homes/surroundings.  Most kids won't really be effected, a few might get a runny nose at the start of the school year and then be fine, but some kids can get really sick.  


After the pneumonia we had to start keeping him home for as long as possible, we actually made a standard of two weeks just to be safe for a while, that way he'd have time to get through one virus before catching another, he slowly started to improve and get stronger after that and we were able to calm down a bit.     


  


As a side note based on my history though, colds are my biggest trigger and I can't seem to recover without a round of prednisone.  As a child I spent months of every year with bronchitis and not being able to breathe, I was only diagnosed a couple years ago, and now I know to call the drs as soon as the attacks start.  Otherwise I am not going to get better.   Even with my maintenance inhaler and so on.(#8)Mold, dust allergies or other allergies most likely. Are the antibiotics making any difference when she takes them (as they clearly aren't 'curing' anything if she needs them so often)?

Try changing washing powders, soaps and shampoos for the least perfumed, gentlest ones you can. If your house suffers from black mold, get that sorted. Try a good quality air purifier in her room at night.

Unfortunately it's often a trial and error thing, and your average GP-level doctor is not the best with asthma or broader breathing complaints. With any luck, the cause is one of the things you can control.(#9)Maybe she is allergic to something that triggers it. A prick test done by an allergologist or pulmonologist could maybe help figure it out(#10)Our five year old daughter has viral induced cough variant asthma, experiences similar symptoms and has ended up in the hospital for oral steroids too many times. She was on a higher dose of Advair, along with Ventolin and Pulmicort via nebulizer when having episodes, but it was effecting her cortisol levels and behaviour. We have recently switched from Advair to Zenhale based on a recommendation from our pulmonologist at the Mayo Clinic. She does not have any allergies and we are hopeful that she will grow out of this eventually, however it is very concerning for us in the meantime. Hopefully you can narrow down the diagnosis and find something that works well for controlling the symptoms.(#11)I agree with mold but it also sound like it could be GERD making it worse. My asthma dramatically improved when I started GERD meds.(#12)37yo asthmatic here, had catastrophically bad asthma as a child, it's mostly fine now as an adult.

Correlation isn't causation, and it's important to keep that in mind, but the obvious first step is to look for something at her school.  It could be a lot of things.  Mold, cut grass, plants nearby she's allergic to, dust or mold in the HVAC system...

It could also be impacted by seasonality and things like humidity, temperature, etc. which will make tracking down the source a lot more difficult.  It could be something at home that just wasn't that bad until it got cold and/or damp and/or dry.  Maybe the HVAC system at home wasn't really on until recently.  So check the home for all the suspects, as well:  mold, dust, dander, etc etc etc.  Feather pillows were AWFUL for me as a kid.  It can be so many things.

When's the last time she was thoroughly allergy tested?  I don't know how it's done now - when I was a kid they put a big plate of little needles in my back, and each one was tipped with something different.  Didn't hurt at all, it doesn't puncture the skin.  Then they waited and observed and circled any reactions with a marker (I remember the marker was worse than the needles, because it was cold and it tickled).

I would highly, highly advise getting her thoroughly allergy tested by someone with a good reputation, and cultivating a doctor or group of doctors who specialize in upper respiratory problems like allergies, asthma, bronchitis, etc.  Having a sympathetic and specialized team of doctors is going to be very important as she grows up.

And finally, be very cautious and careful about what controller meds and steroids you put her on, and for how long, etc.  Prolonged steroid use can have dramatic and profound effects on kids that last well into adulthood.  I was on nonstop steroids until I was about 10 years old and then suddenly my doctor decided to take me off of them, and I gained about 100lbs over a few years which I've never been able to lose.(#13)I had the same thing happen to me, I was allergic to dust mites. 
Go to an allergic right away and get a skin prick test to see what‚Äôs she‚Äôs allergic to and after that get immunotherapy to fix it. Keep taking medicines until the doctor asks to stop. If allergies are the only reason then your daughter will be fine and immunotherapy will reduce her reliance on medicines within 6 months.
And if she‚Äôs found allergic then please start immunotherapy right away, it‚Äôs the only way to fix it. The medication just reduce the symptoms not solve the problem(#14)Only happens at Night? then it's not the school - its the bedroom or diet could be bedbugs, house mites,  bedding allergies  such as duck down. chemicals in the memory foam or the  carpet if its artificial - could be eating too much close to bedtime (stomach pushes up against the diaphragm reduce breathing capacity)

Are there any signs of mould or damp?

my Asthma is alway worse when the seasons change. for the colder Its weird between summer and autumn and the autumn to winter.  then once we are in the season proper it recovers.(#15)ive had the same issue as a kid coughing till i threw up . is it like a clear substance ?(#16)There are a lot of good suggestions here so I won't go into much detail on what people have already covered. Air cleaners (hepa filter, avoid the ozone stuff), allergy testing, try to find out what she reacts to (both environmental and food) and medications are a great start. Seeing an allergist and/or pulmonologist is also a very good idea. I really hope you find answers that way!  


If nothing works and you are at a loss, start looking for more uncommon things. 

\- Does she have diabetes? That would come with other symptoms, but would make a person more likely to get sick. 

\- Does she have any kind of airway disease where she can't cough stuff up properly so whatever she's reacting to stays in her lungs. That can give you the germ of the month club type of response. I know sometimes airways can be floppy and collapse under pressure such as coughing or just exhaling with force (trapping the allergens/mucus). I have also heard of stuff where the cillia don't work right and make it hard to get stuff out of the airways and lungs. Hopefully the specialists would know what to look for. Again, only look for unusual stuff if the most likely causes have been ruled out.(#17)It looks like a ""hypersensitivity pneumonitis"". You need to consult a pulmonologist.(#18)I used to(and still do)get these exact same symptoms from a combo of asthma, bronchitis, and acute sinusitis. When I was kid it was way worse as an adult I've learned what things help make it easier and help me cope with it better.  I still can't cry without going into a coughing choking vomit fit tho.(#19)Is it at night after dinner? I have copd/ asthma and pollution and food allergies trigger me bad(#20)As a kid I coughed till I puked almost every night about an hour after falling asleep.  We could not figure it out‚Ä¶. Then I got my tonsils and adenoids out, for unrelated reasons, when I was 7 or 8 and it never happened again.(#21)I'm not sure if it has been mentioned already but very rarely children can inhale small foreign bodies that can cause asthma-like symptoms and give persistent fevers/bronchitis requiring antibiotics. Inhaled food particles may not show up on an xray either.

I think I'd be looking at getting a CT scan and then think about a bronchoscopy.(#22)Shower in tab water with chloramine can cause asthma. Check to see if the water she use when the symptoms developed has changed.(#23)üò¢"

1925,149,0.99,13,"(#1)Well first off they weren't necessarily pure tobacco cigarettes like you'd buy at the gas station. But they did eventually have tobacco in them. 

They generally contained things like stramonium leaves, tea leaves, chestnut leaves, gum benzoin, and kola nuts. Here's a quick article about it

[https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/when-cigarettes-were-medicine-looking-back-on-a-popular-asthma-treatment](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/when-cigarettes-were-medicine-looking-back-on-a-popular-asthma-treatment)

And here's a long article about the history of using stramonium as an asthma treatment before we had good, safe meds to help asthmatics.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844275/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844275/)

But basically, there was a misunderstanding of what caused asthma back then. Here's a quote: ""Believing that asthma was more likely to be caused by spasmodic constriction of the bronchi than by the accumulation of mucus, Laennec recommended a variety of anti-spasmodics, including opium, belladonna, stramonium, tobacco, hyoscyamus and coffee.""

And of course, in the nineteenth century, smoking was growing as a popular leisure activity. So never underestimate the desire for merchants of all sorts to jump on the bandwagon to make some extra $$$. That WAS the era of snake oil salesmen and garbage medications with zero oversight.(#2)An inhaler or nebulizer the size of a vape pen would be so nice(#3)More proof that Kelloggs has always y sucked.(#4)I wonder if they actually had some different ingredient that they thought would be better for asthma users . Probably just the same cigarette but with ‚Äúfor asthma users‚Äù on it .(#5)Inhaling fresh smoke from burning tobacco must have been beneficial for asthma then lol(#6)Do. Not. Inhale. Particulates.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.(#7)'For when your asthma isn't bad enough'.(#8)What was their mindset? ‚ÄúHe reacts by coughing to these cigars so it works as a treatment right?‚Äù"
Symbicort coupon.,4,0.84,9,"(#1)There is a generic for Symbicort. My copay for name brand is $50. For the generic, it's $10.(#2)There is no more coupon for symbicort as there's a generic out now that's made by Astra zenica..(#3)I just noticed in the WebMD app they have a section for prescription coupons (a lot like GoodRX). You can also search online for manufacturers coupons, I don‚Äôt remember symbicort ever costing me that much on my insurance but I can‚Äôt keep straight which inhalers I‚Äôve had coupons for and how much I paid once they disappear out of the app I use for prescription management through my pharmacy. Sometimes your doctor can give you some coupons or samples in office, I had that from my pulmonologist when I first started Symbicort years ago, he gave me two samples and a handful of coupons to lower the price at the pharmacy. 

I also saw other say there is a generic, that can also be helpful if it is signed off for by your doctor or works for you!"
Can I take prednisone while on Xolair?,3,1.0,13,"(#1)Yes you can - not a doctor but I take prednisone sometimes while on xolair. Reach out to your doctor to confirm 100% but I think you will be fine.(#2)Why would you ask us when you can ask your trained pharmacist?

If your pharmacy is closed, look up a 24 hour pharmacy and call them.(#3)If your doctor says you need pred, then you need pred.(#4)Yes. During one of the drug studies they found no negative interactions between Xolair and prednisone. That's not to say anyone can't have a random, weird unexpected reaction but there is no known contraindication between the two drugs.(#5)Yes, you can take prednisone while on xolair.

Xolair usually makes me feel pretty bad for two days after I get it, then I start feeling better. I don't know if it does that to everyone.(#6)Just want to share- my mom has severe asthma and xolair has been life changing for her. At her worst, she was on 100mg of prednisone a day, nebulizing, etc. Since being on xolair, she has only had to be on prednisone once time for an illness. I hope it works as well for you as it does for her. Also, I do know she is still prescribed prednisone in case of a flare up so it is okay to take with xolair, but of course always check with your Doctor. I hope you feel better soon. I am dealing with an asthma flare up and on prednisone now too and it is just so frustrating.(#7)I take maintenance Prednisolone (chemically similar to Prednisone) and I'm on Xolair. But tbh your best of speaking to your doctor.(#8)Wear a n95 mask in the short term. Like all day."
Can someone tell me why I only got one inhaler but the QTY says 12? Also why is the retail price for Flovent almost $600 for one single inhaler?,39,0.95,68,"(#1)The above comments are incorrect. Flovent 220 is a 12 gram inhaler, quantity of 12 is one inhaler.(#2)$600?! I'm from the UK and it's absolutely wild to me to see prices on medication. We just pay a flat fee (around ¬£10) for any prescription. Never appreciated the cost of individual meds!

Edit: I believe this applies to England only, not the whole UK. Thanks u/pretend-its-good(#3)I had to pay $400/inhaler when i lost my health insurance üòëüòëüòëüòë(#4)What‚Äôs sad is that in my country it would probably be cheaper than for you after your insurance. Or in any country with universal healthcare.(#5)Flovent HFA and Advair HFA are the only meds that I can take that keep my asthma under control. Unfortunately my insurance no longer covers both so I have to use something else. I wish I could take them but I could not afford to pay $600 a month for it.(#6)The price is almost $600 because American ""healthcare"" is a fucking joke.(#7)If you have no insurance or commercial insurance you can use manufacturer coupons or ‚Äú loyalty cards‚Äù that really lower the cost. Ask your dr‚Äôs office or google it or even call the manufacturer. 

There are also discount cards like singlecare, GoodRx, etc. that can lower costs. You have to do some comparison shopping on their apps(#8)Holy crap. Prescription medicine is free here in NZ. Apparently there is something good about my country after all. üòû(#9)Bro im not paying anything for my flovant(#10)Your doc was trying to be clever and get you a year's worth of Flovent at once. Your insurance absolutely will not allow that. They MIGHT allow 3 months (which mine does). 

It's expensive because there is no generic version of Flovent, so Glaxo Smith Kline can charge whatever they want.(#11)All 12 means is that is the max quantity your insurance will cover during the specified time period.(#12)So I had this happen to me but w quantity 3 instead of 12. You were supposed to receive 12 of those for 600 dollars not 1. You need to contact the pharmacy asap.(#13)Have you worked with your doctor/allergist to see if there is a medication in the same family that you can try. My allergist has a poster like this on the back of the door. Price checked through my insurance then tried a different med. now pay 150 for 3 months instead of 300 power month. https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/inhalers-at-a-glance-posters-resources/(#14)10 -30 bucks Max in Oz(#15)in spain with recipe is around 12-20 euros. without is around 60. without recipe is cheaper in uk, it gives you more flexibility this later case(#16)Others have mentioned how, in the UK, we would pay from nothing to a maximum of around $13 USD

Just to add what the UK pays for the drug from the manufacturer means that the ""retail price"" is clearly bull!

Here in the UK, the brand name for Flovent is Flixotide and due to where the dosage is measured we would call the 220mcg a 250mcg.

The NHS price for a 120 dose inhaler is ¬£36.14 which is about $50.

On the basis your insurance was able to negotiate the same deal as the UK's NHS, then your insurance only paid $12 towards the medication!(#17)USA! USA! USA! We‚Äôre number one! We‚Äôre number one! /s

I hate living in a country where medicine is just another for-profit, capitalistic endeavor.(#18)I wanna recommend inhousepharmacy.vu. Each Flovent is like 60 bucks from them and you don‚Äôt need a prescription either. I‚Äôve used them and they‚Äôre a lifesaver. Seriously please consider this, they‚Äôre an absolute lifesaver.(#19)I have found this.  The real price of the Inhaler is what you pay and a small amount of agreed money.  The insurance industry and the pharma have Bullshit jargon to make it look like they are saving you butt tons of money but in fact they pay a lot less than that.   Never lease ANY at home durable medical goods it is a scam and a half.  You end up paying for the item such as a home nebulizer or a cpap 3 times. Your better off buying direct from Cpap.com and having a doctor send the script.
Same for home nebulizer that uses liquid albuterol.  Don‚Äôt ever lease from a durable goods store, freaking worse than the mob.(#20)America is the answer"

Londoners with lung or heart issues told to avoid strenuous activity on Friday due to pollution,28,1.0,3,"(#1)Article:

Londoners should avoid strenuous physical activity on Friday due to ‚Äúvery high‚Äù levels of pollution, experts have warned.

The poor air quality is the result of an intense area of high pressure covering western Europe. The associated lack of air movement means emissions from vehicles and other pollutants are not blown away as they usually would be.

The government‚Äôs forecast predicts pollution levels will hit band 10, the highest level on the scale. The last time pollution levels hit this mark was in March 2018.

Older people and those with lung or heart problems should avoid strenuous physical activity, the government‚Äôs official advice stated, while people with asthma may need to use inhalers more often.

Even healthy people should ‚Äúreduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, especially if you experience symptoms such as a cough or sore throat‚Äù.

The worst pollution is forecast to be in the city centre, with the dirtiest air stretching from Stratford in the east to Hammersmith in the west, though pollution levels are expected to be high throughout the entire city.

Earlier this week Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said car use had returned to close to pre-pandemic levels, and that the effect on residents could be disastrous. ‚ÄúIf we do not double down on our efforts to deliver a greener, more sustainable future, we will replace one public health crisis with another ‚Äì caused by filthy air and gridlocked roads.‚Äù

Pollution levels are expected to return to normal by Saturday.(#2)It's the same in the Same Francisco bay area today (and has been on and off for a month). RIP my workout routine and general health(#3)This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/londoners-told-to-reduce-physical-activity-on-friday-due-to-pollution) reduced by 59%.

Weird symptoms? Asthma?,6,0.8,19,"(#1)I am no expert at all - especially not in asthma (recent diagnosis) - but it gave me the feeling you might want to look into anxiety or panic attacks.

Edit: They can happen without fear.(#2)I didn't have asthma or even allergies as a kid but in my young adult days experience something very similar to what you're describing. In my 20s I developed many environmental allergies and after several years started experiencing very mild, fleeting asthma symptoms. 

My primary sent me to a pulmonologist who did all the tests, pulmonary function, methacholine challenge, and various labs. My eosinophil count and pulmonary function during the methacholine challenge were both right at the border of whether or not it's determined to be asthma so the pulmonologist said no and that he thought I must just be out of shape. I don't deny that I'm out of shape but that didn't sit right with me or my primary given the borderline results. 

I then went to an immunologist who said that my allergies getting so much worse was causing me to develop mild asthma and that's when he started me on allergy shots twice a week. After 6 months went down to once a week, then every other week, then monthly. My symptoms started getting worse at monthly so I went back to every other week. 

I've been at that dosing for a few years now. It took maybe 2 years or a little more to really get the full benefit of the allergy shots which from my understanding is normal. I'm also still on several allergy meds taken orally. I haven't had much trouble breathing for quite some time except for the occasional wheezing and chronic sinus symptoms. I was getting hives badly almost every day and now I only get hives once every few months. Definitely bring it up with his doctor but personally I'd just make sure he keeps the inhaler with him (although don't use it too much because albuterol and similar meds can cause things like heart palpitations or increased heart rate) and keep in mind it may take quite a bit of time for the shots to be fully effective. My doc made it sound more like this plan was to stop the progression rather than actually undoing it so you may want to clarify those goals with his doctor as well(#3)I was diagnosed with asthma at about 12 and your son's story sounds very similar to mine. I was diagnosed with lots of allergies and then we had a mile run outside in the fall in PE. Full on attack. I would say for sure watch for allergy/exercise induced asthma.(#4)If I were you I'd get him checked out by the cardiologist again. He might be getting self-limiting runs of supra-ventricular tachycardia (SVT). A cardiologist could order a holter monitor for him or do an exercise stress test to try to induce the symptom.(#5)Not a dr. Today I was reading about a link between anemia and shortness of breath.(#6)I am just coming back to update on this! I appreciated everyone‚Äôs posts. 
We met with our allergist today and he said he is confident it isn‚Äôt asthma. He felt it may be a vocal chord dysfunction issue (maybe a mild one) OR he said it could be the heart palpitations, so he agreed that a monitor would be a good follow up route on that side and if nothing shows there, we may take a look at the vocal chords and see if that is what is going on. 

Anyway, thank you all so much and I will try to remember to follow up once we do the heart monitor."
Vomiting from asthma attack,18,0.96,15,"(#1)Vomiting from asthma or severe coughing is a common occurrence for me. Honestly it sometimes feels better when you can cough up some of the phlegm blocking your lungs/airways.  But is also means your asthma is poorly controlled. Since you have been experiencing this flare since October and the cold air is triggering, I would highly advise you see your PCP or pulmonologist. They may need to change up your maintenance meds, recheck your lungs to make sure the bronchitis had cleared or hasn't turned into a walking pneumonia,  and/or do a covid test. You may need a short burst of steroids to get the asthma under control or a different maintenance med. Good luck.(#2)It sounds like it's not controlled. Yes I get diaphragmatic spasms and vomit or dry heave.  With asthma I have to use my preventative every day, year round to prevent the mucous from building up and causing constriction in the lungs. Which then causes what your explaining. Essentially that's what happens. Also, the bronchioles may be inflamed, which is important to reach out to a dr.

It's possible the bronchitis didn't fully leave and you have mild pneumonia (at worst, but please call physician). This is not to scare you, its very possible that it may be lingering just like you say.(#3)When ever I am out in weather below 40 degrees I cover my mouth- scarf or a mask. The cold air with exercise makes me puke.(#4)It's quite possible the cold weather is doing it. I know for me in the winter I also get super winded, slightly dizzy even, when climbing stairs. Not so much in the Summer. Good luck!(#5)This happens to me, especially after upper respiratory infections. I use to have to keep water and cough drops on hand all the time. It starts as a tingle right and then kind of builds from there? 

What I've noticed with my asthma attacks, is that mucus starts to flood my system and the drainage causes this issues. It hasn't happened as much since I changed my inhalers and got things more under control.(#6)When you're outside, you need to wear a face covering to prewarm the air.

If you're coughing so violently that you are vomiting, you need to see your doctor.(#7)yeah i get this during the spring a lot. i normally just cough until i throw up. i lost a lot of weight so hopefully it wont be as bad this spring.(#8)Oh yes. I have coughed until the point of vomiting more times than I can count.
Along with pulling numerous muscles. It‚Äôs fun‚Ä¶NOT!(#9)Thank you all SO MUCH!!!!!! I am under doctors orders to stay home for a bit until we find a new regiment. Endlessly appreciative!(#10)Yeah, that has happened to me. It's been a while though. Sounds like you are doing the right things, though...seeing your PCP (mentioned in comments) and taking care of yourself during the pandemic.(#11)Ive had this happen as a child as a bad asthma attack before its so fun"
Nebulizer vs inhaler,13,0.89,47,"(#1)I probably would be dead without my nebulizer.(#2)It would be worth checking your inhaler technique and having a conversation with your doctor about any possible contributing factors such as allergies or acid reflux. For example, my inhaler gives me limited relief when my asthma's flaring up because of allergies; it's my antihistamines that really do the job in that case.

Also what sort of inhaler do you have? Do you use a spacer? They can be really game-changing for using an MDI. My spacer stopped me having asthma attacks where I was needing to use like 9-10 puffs of my inhaler to get it to stop (because basically I wasn't able to use the inhaler correctly and get enough medication into my lungs), now when I have similar attacks I only need like 3 puffs using the spacer because I can use a different breathing technique with it. Using a spacer is considered as effective as a nebulizer in many cases.

Unless you have really severe asthma, you probably don't need a nebulizer. It's pretty uncommon in most places aside from the US to be prescribed one and depending on your doctor they might not agree to prescribe you one.(#3)Absolutely.  i will be doing the same thing as well if my symptoms worsen(#4)A new doctor I was consulting with, advised me to use a spacer with my rescue inhaler. He said you can just usecan empty single servingbplastic wster bottle. cut a hole in the end. It doesn't need to be airtight. It works much better.(#5)A spacer may help improve the relief you feel from your inhaler. I had a bad time a couple of years ago and mentioned a neb to my specialist because I had one when I was a kid. He was completely against the idea. His thinking was if I was bad enough to need a nebuliser I should be in hospital and we spent about 8 months trying a whole host of stuff. Eventually I was put on the waiting list for biological injections and they have worked really well. I don‚Äôt need as much medication as before and haven‚Äôt had an attack in 12 months. 

What I‚Äôm getting at is if your asthma doesn‚Äôt feel right speak to your doctor but don‚Äôt limit the conversation to inhaler or nebuliser, there is a whole host of treatments out there and some of them are life changing. And just remember you know your lungs better than they do. If they don‚Äôt want to even have the conversation with you about alternatives, then ask to see a specialist.(#6)Nebulizer helps calm down my wheezing more than just an inhaler(#7)Yeah, when my asthma flares up the nebulizer helps a lot more. I find it to be alot stronger and will def make my heart race and leave me feeling  shaky/ jittery but definitely opens up my lungs when I am having a hard time breathing.(#8)It‚Äôs worth it especially when you‚Äôre sick or have bronchitis. Definitely use a spacer with your inhaler too.(#9)100% worth it(#10)So I have been taking my blue inhaler a couple of times a day all my life. I‚Äôm 49 - 4 days ago I buy a dehumidifier and I havnt touched my blue inhaler in 4 days - WTF!!!!(#11)Yes!(#12)Yes. I always prefer the neb.(#13)I would be dead without my nebulizer. It's a godsend for my more severe asthma attacks. I'm on steroids now which helps but I still use the nebulizer at least once a month, more if I'm sick.(#14)I like my nebulizer much better. I just got the Aura one and it is amazing. Silent and you can do it anywhere.(#15)it helps. for me is less important than the inhaler, but it helps(#16)Nebs are for when you can‚Äôt get over the hump and asthma inhalers aren‚Äôt cutting it . So I‚Äôm short it is worth it but, nothing will work honestly if you aren‚Äôt already on steroids and are seeing a pulmonologist and see an ENT.(#17)Imo nebulizer is better than inhaler, theyre just very effective(#18)I personally prefer a nebulizer over a inhaler, although I learned how to properly use a spacer to get some relief. I had a childhood doctor who told me ‚Äúmost people with severe asthma prefer a nebulizer because it does most of the work for us‚Äù. ( mainly with masked nebulizers I guess). And with a inhaler without a spacer more medicine is likely to escape from your mouth than go into your lungs. And a inhaler with a spacer has to be used properly to get the medication to your lungs instead of just settling in your mouth or throat. I hope you‚Äôre able to get a nebulizer as well!(#19)If your inhaler isn‚Äôt Very effective use the nebulizer(#20)If the rescue inhaler doesn't appear to work, you may be misinterpreting something as an attack when actually is not.

If you are using your rescue more than 2-3 times a week, you need to talk to your doctor about adjusting your controller meds."
Do cold and flu meds make your asthma worse?,3,0.72,8,"(#1)I'm not a medical professional, to keep that in mind.

One thing my doctor told my family when I was younger was to avoid cold and flu medication.  The reason is that they thicken up the mucus so that your nose doesn't run as much.  The downside is that it means the mucus in your lungs is also thickened up, making it much harder to cough and breath, especially if you're already sick.(#2)I try to take just an expectorant like guaifenesin (at the recommendation of my dr) ans not long term and then chug like 8 oz of water. I can't take most combination meds as they just make me feel weird.(#3)No joke I took Sudafed the other day for congestion and not feeling well‚Ä¶ within 35-40 mins after I could NOT breathe well at all! Had to take a few puffs off albuterol just to find some relief and even then so didn‚Äôt get better until next morning! Scared me to pieces! I don‚Äôt have to take meds often like that thankfully it was scary!(#4)Look up samsters triad asthma.  You may have an aspirin allergy that will make your asthma much worse.(#5)Like the comment above said try only expectorant. These flu meds have expectorant and cough suppressant. I usually read ingredients and match it to what I need when I‚Äôm sick. You need only expectorant to help expel the mucus/phlegm that‚Äôs giving you a hard time to breathe.(#6)When i get really sick and my symptoms are chronic ( yay meeee not lol ) my cough is out of control so i usually take cough medicine it usually helps for half an hour and does nothing it doesnt make my asthma worse tho . thats why i want to look into a treatment like a nebulizer that would actually work . last time i was sick i har a full on flare up"
I got an inhaler today...,15,1.0,3,"(#1)If you are using the rescue more than 2-3 times a week except for exercise, you need to talk to your doctor about a controller med.

Even though the label says every 4 hours, we are not supposed to use it this way. It's something I wish doctors would explain to patients. If you are using it every 4 hours for relief, you need to be on a daily controller med."
Omicron‚Ä¶.my turn,55,0.96,54,"(#1)I got lucky and it didn't effect my lungs at all really. I am soooooooo freaken fatigued though.(#2)Same experience here. My lungs felt incredible the whole time(#3)Have you had any change in cough? Like worsening during omicron? Mine got a lot worse(#4)My lungs haven't felt great, when I get up I'm having to cough up thick mucus, then I can breathe ok until the next time my meds start to wear off. Besides my usual singulair and xolair, I'm taking mucinex, Sudafed and symbicort. I've needed my inhaler a few times and the nebulizer once. I have prednisone to take if I end up needing it, but so far I'd rather wait.(#5)Yea it's not really messing with my lungs any. I'm on day 5. Pcp gave a steroid shot as a precaution. I'm also bring treated foe a double ear infection so I had a lot of inflammation going on.(#6)We all just got over it as well! My son is the bad asthmatic and I was so scared when he tested positive, but it was snot for like three days and that‚Äôs all! No fever or anything.(#7)You guys are making me feel better lol. I‚Äôm terrified of Covid but I know it‚Äôs going to happen eventually. I‚Äôm so worried I‚Äôll have an asthma attack.(#8)I'm so glad to see this post! I have intermittent asthma, it comes everytime im sick with a cold. I'm on day 4 of omicron and up to now I barely had symptoms, I was starting to get smug that I am over it, but it just settled on my chest today. I can still breathe fine its just that yucky anxiety inducing feeling. Fingers crossed I'm like the majority of you(#9)Any zinc lozenges or xlear spray or gargles???(#10)In the same exact boat as the OP! I'm trying Sudafed now...(#11)Hey guys I‚Äôm on day 4 of Omi and asthma has been great so far. I take Symbicort daily, twice in AM and twice in PM. I have a pro air inhaler for emergencies. The Symbicort and pro air are my normal meds even before Omi so nothing has changed with my meds since testing positive. I do take Emergen-C that has Vitamin C, D & Zinc in it every day in the AM after a small breakfast and also some dual action Advil for the headaches. I drink about 70-100 ounces of water a day and eat light though out the day. My symptoms were massive headache, soar throat, dried sinuses and a foggy feeling head. No cough or congestion. Now that I‚Äôm on day 4 it‚Äôs just dried sinuses and the occasional cough up of flem. Actually feeling pretty good, plenty of energy so I went ahead and took down Christmas yesterday on day 3, gonna finish up today. I‚Äôll post updates in the future. Glad to hear great Omi asthmatic stories.(#12)Me toooo!   On day 4 and I‚Äôm already so much better.   Worse day was the first day.  Basically felt like a headcold + bad hangover.   Every day since feels exactly the same but 10% less.   I have had absolutely zero lung impacts.   I‚Äôve got me some chromic asthma guys - if you‚Äôre boosted - this really isn‚Äôt scary.  

So fucking grateful for the vaccine and science.(#13)Was your breathing and lungs regular the whole time ?(#14)I'm on day 3 of symptoms- not having any breathing problems, but the fatigue, aches, and pains are gnarly. I could barely move this morning and ended up going back to sleep for another couple of hours. I drove over to Walgreens to get a new inhaler and it completely drained me. I'm ready to go back to sleep.(#15) I had it in Christmas....mainly headaches, lethargy and a sore throat. Day 7 means you should be coming out the other side. Hope you feel better soon(#16)I‚Äôm beating it now and thank god it never went to my lungs. I also never had congestion or mucus, just a dry cough. I had major body aches, high fever, exhaustion.(#17)It sounds like that the virus has forced your body in a position where it is creating a way of draining your sinuses which could indicate a that once fully healthy you might need to get with an ENT and see if you possibly have chronic sinusitis.(#18)Update? 

Omicron did not affect my lungs at all for the first week but it did the second week‚Ä¶(#19)i have smoked pack a day for four years, that is fucking bad feeling, not some popular disease, imho"
How do I remove drainage/fluid from the bottom of my lung?,5,0.78,16,"(#1)You probably need some pred which your doctor needs to prescribe.  Time to find a new doctor if you can.(#2)Hi, I have asthma and allergies and I know that yucky feeling. Do continuing getting medical treatment from actual doctors. For day to day, I find this technique helpful. A british doctor made this video in the early days of covid, but the 5 deep breaths then big cough technique does really help clear the gunk from deep in your lungs. https://youtu.be/bBkGDIeQwXo(#3)Yeaaaaah you cannot do that without medical supervision. Find a different doctor, look into pulmonologists or respiratory therapists.

Edit to add: did you follow up with your doctor after the antibiotics? A fair number of medical professionals start with simple treatments, and when those don't work you have to go back to them and say ""hey this didn't work the problem is persisting"".(#4)You can't. A doctor needs to diagnose you and determine the cause.(#5)The comments are good advice. I would like to add to stay hydrated and active. As much as you can. I hope you feel better soon.(#6)Research Active Cycle Breathing Techniques. It helped me get the deep lung sputum out when I had bronchitis.(#7)This sounds a lot like me. The advice I was given was using a nebuliser with saline solution. This helps the lungs to move the mucous. I'm still coughing up stuff at the moment but it does seem to be getting better.

But I would definitely talk to a doctor about it. I was diagnosed with large airway collapse. Which is the reason I can't get rid of mucous properly.(#8)I say you‚Äôd have to see a doctor so they can put on a combination of antibiotics but, really your best is to continue taking your every day meds and play the waiting game until it eventually comes up."
Anyone had experience with the medication Ibudilast?,2,1.0,0,
"If you don't mind, could you share your asthma attack experience?",11,0.87,24,"(#1)I most often have coughing rather than wheezing when I have an attack (though I also have attacks with wheezing and chest tightness), so my family picks up on an attack pretty quick. They know to get me something warm and caffeinated (and to get me out of the area if need-be) and if we're away from home and I drove, somebody else usually has to drive home. I keep my inhaler on me, so nobody gets too concerned, but the inhaler makes me tired and spaced out, so it's nice to have someone else do anything that requires real focus until I'm a little better.(#2)Struggling to breathe in and out very similar to trying to breath through a small straw. Starts out annoying but then you stress about it and gets worse and worse. If you have an inhaler no problem, but if not you gotta go to the hospital. Mine is normally induced by allergies.(#3)I usually get ample warning because I normally get them from not taking proper care of colds. But I've also had them from kittens, fumes, pollen and mold. The warning signs (for me) are: coughing non-stop, wheezing, chest pain or pressure, or a feeling that my breathing tubes are narrowing. I've had asthma for so long that I am well-trained. I have never allowed an attack to get to the point where my O2 goes below 95% If I am not at home near my meds, I have to go to the ER, where I get a nebulizer treatment. After that, my chest hurts for days and the wheezing gets gradually more manageable if I have an infection, or immediately better if I am no longer near the allergen.(#4)Most of my family or friends know that I either need my puffer, or caffeine.  But fortunately, my asthma attacks are no longer severe.  No blue lips anymore, just a bit of constriction and a dry cough.(#5)just had the worst attack of my life so far like 30 minutes ago.
it's like breathing through a straw.(#6)My ‚Äúattacks‚Äù are mild. My most recent one, I realized I‚Äôd been coughing for a while, debated with myself whether to use my inhaler or not since it was 10pm and it might keep me up, then did use it, I stopped coughing, and was jittery and had a hard time falling asleep. 

I sometimes have exacerbations that last a few weeks to months. One happened after a run in the summer on a very humid day. My breathing just felt *wrong* for a few days despite using my inhaler every 4 hours. I went to urgent care. They gave me a prednisone prescription and told me to keep using my inhaler. I took both, no change. I called my PCP and they sent me to a respiratory specialist. They gave me a COVID test (negative) and told me to switch from twice daily Flovent to twice daily Advair. Within a day I started to feel improvement, but it took me nearly a month to get to that point, and in the meantime I was getting out of breath even walking to the bathroom. 

So because they‚Äôre not big deals, I don‚Äôt really have to have my family/friends trained on anything. I do however keep an EpiPen at home and my partner knows where it is and I‚Äôve shown him how to use it ‚Äî I‚Äôve never needed it, but I take allergy drops (aka sublingual immunotherapy, like allergy shots but in liquid form that goes under the tongue at home daily), and I have an EpiPen just in case bc of that.(#7)Regular attacks ?

(Inner dialogue)

Uh‚Ä¶ cough‚Ä¶ crap‚Ä¶ where‚Äôs my inhaler ? (Foosh)‚Ä¶ ahhh‚Ä¶ okay, time to chill for a bit‚Ä¶
Ok, all good.

Bad attack?

Geez‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ breathe‚Ä¶ inhaler ‚Ä¶. (Foosh)‚Ä¶ wtf ? Another hit (Foosh)‚Ä¶ still ? Crap‚Ä¶ step away from possible allergens‚Ä¶ calm down, calm down‚Ä¶ wheeze‚Ä¶. Okay, sit down, rest‚Ä¶(#8)last time my whole family had to calm me down , at first it was just me and my cousin , she panicked , rest of the night everyone took care of me , n last asthma flare i just called an emergancy clinic(#9)Haven't had too many asthma attacks recently, but for some I get really lethargic, almost to the point of passing out, for others non stop coughing, and just so much tension in my chest as it kind of turns into a panic attack. Luckily inhaler is the way to go. Nebulizer second if nothing calms down. If people don't know I have asthma, 911 always seems to get called... but luckily my family knows the drill now(#10)Depends on how bad, I've had mild asthma attacks that i just deal with that can last hours or days. If they don't get better or get worse I've had to go to the emergency room and sometimes have been admitted for days. Obviously use an emergency inhaler and nebulizer treatments but my machine sucks and sometimes doesn't help.

Usually I dont have any issues like that when I'm on a maintenance inhaler but because of insurance I've sometimes had to go months or up to a year or so without one(#11)I can‚Äôt sleep anymore, and I barely slept but woke up at 7 am because of my asthma. I had to go into the er where the doctors actually believed me when I said I had asthma. They took my asthma into consideration and didn‚Äôt immediately put me with COVID positive people. They‚Äôre going to give me steroids and a breathing treatment. Unfortunately, my asthma attacks have gotten so frequent that I stopped contacting family before going to the er. It just worries them unnecessarily. If anything, the doctors and nurses have your emergency contact information. My sibling is my primary decision maker in case I can‚Äôt decide for myself, and my family (mom, dad, etc) are all on that card as well for anything else.(#12)I don‚Äôt wheeze much, if at all. I often can‚Äôt tell when coughing is asthma.

But if I get exposed to cigarette smoke or another trigger, it‚Äôs not subtle. My bronchial tubes slam shut and I breathe through a metaphorical straw or not at all. I usually sit or drop, and the edges of my vision go black. Twice, I lost all vision but could still hear.

It is very hard to fend off people trying to put a paper bag over your mouth when you‚Äôre like this. Apparently they think I‚Äôm hyperventilating, instead of the opposite.

By this point there‚Äôs little hope getting any of the inhaler in, and I‚Äôm lucky it‚Äôs let go of it‚Äôs own accord so I can take enough inhaler to breathe more normally. The attack wipes out out for the day, exhausted and contemplating mortality, but extremely restless and jittery from the inhaler.(#13)Like a couple others who commented, I get pretty bad chest tightness and the feeling that I‚Äôm breathing through a straw. It feels like I‚Äôm breathing heavy but can‚Äôt actually get any air in. With Ventolin, it generally improves pretty quickly but I‚Äôll feel pretty weak/tired for a while afterwards and then I get a dry cough. Because mine are mild, it honestly takes me a minute to even realize I need Ventolin and in that case, I‚Äôve never been unable to get it myself but my friends and family know which one to grab and to give me space. Sitting outside can help too, as long as it‚Äôs not humid or very cold(#14)I get coughs and wheezing. If I'm going somewhere where it might be triggered,  I make sure my puffer is with me and my husband knows where it is if I can't get it for some reason. 

Usually I feel it before it gets bad, so I go outside (allergic to cats, dogs, smoke, perfumes, etc.) and do  calm breathing because panicking only makes it worse. Make sure someone knows where you are and that you might need their help.(#15)I haven‚Äôt been medically announced as asthmatic but I‚Äôm on a peak flow which is indicating I‚Äôm asthmatic on really bad days I have shortness of breathe coughing nose full of mucus and I‚Äôm really unmotivated to get out of bed but I go doctors soon with my results so I will know soon.(#16)I've had asthma my whole life and I've come across people that think ""oh it can't be that bad"" or think you're blowing it out of perportion. I heard from a few people after having covid that now they understand.(#17)I‚Äôll share my worst experience.

So in the beginning of the  pandemic I was unable to work due to how bad my asthma had gotten so to make money I‚Äôd  watch my nephew whilst my sister went to work. This went on for  awhile with almost no problems.  My family had planned a family dinner in Chicago for my grandmother in February on her birthday that we were supposed to attend. I had just got a re-up asthma meds for the trip so I set almost, you the 2 weeks leading up to the trip the only meds I had were albuterol solution so my  body built an increasing need for higher dosages of the medicine. I would be up with my nephew watching TV and the next waking up from a temporary coma dazed and confused wondering when was it I went to sleep being that I wasn‚Äôt tired. This continued the day we were supposed to go on the trip, my father had just came home from work and woke me up from 2 back-to-back comas and told I needed to stop being ‚Äúlazy‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf you were just gonna sleep on the job you shouldn‚Äôt have agreed to watch him‚Äù he then told me to go out in the cold and clean his car since the only thing I had did all day sleep. I cleaned the car and shortly after my sis picked up my nephew I started getting my bags ready for the trip and my Pops was in the basement fixing the furnace. After he‚Äôd finish that he was making sure everything was still working fine in the meantime I started flaring up. Now at first it wasn‚Äôt that so I took my inhalers which subsided the flare for a minute and then progressively got worse. Eventually my inhalers stopped working and my violent coughing increased rapidly in a few short minutes.I tried as a last ditch effort to use my nebulizer but, not even it would work and because I had wasted more time it had gotten so bad that I could feel my air start to close. I tried stomping on the floor as hard as I could to make my Pops come up the stairs out of irritation so he could see my condition and rush me to the hospital but he just kept yelling ‚Äú WHO KEEPS DOING THAT‚Äù; so with the last of the energy I had and oxygen remaining I was able to reach the basement door and barely yell ‚ÄúWE HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL‚Äù. That sentence was it that little action was it. My body had raised its temperature extremely high due to my muscles contracting trying yo help me breathe, I barely had enough strength to stand on my own, I had an extremely bad migraine from the coughing, and my eyes were super red. Once he comes upstairs he goes ‚ÄúOk put your stuff on so we can go yo the hospital‚Äù at this point it was too late I could barely  walk and it felt as though I was about to pass out.My Pops called 911 and as we waited not so patiently with each passing minute everything got worse fast and in a bout 5 minutes of waiting my airway completely closed and my Pops who was holding me up at the time because I could longer stand on my own begged for them to hurry and at this point I turned to him and said, ‚Äú I‚Äôm about to die‚Äù and passed out. When I woke up I was in the hospital being asked several questions by doctors but I kept fading in and out of consciousness. Eventually I was up long enough to answer questions at which point they told my father I was being admitted into the hospital and that I was ‚Äúlucky to be alive‚Äù. Apparently what happened after I passed out was the ambulance showed up 2-3 minutes later and tried asking me questions none of which I could answer because my oxygen saturation levels had gotten so low that my brain could no longer function that caused me to start seizing and my body temperature had reach like 112 and my blood pressure was through the roof as well as my heart rate.(#18)Recent experience as my asthma abruptly blew up due to thunderstorms/allergies: constant coughing, sounding like I smoked a pack of cigarettes in the morning, mucus, wheezing when laughing, chest pressure, consistent sensation like my sternum is pressing on me, an 'itch' to cough, headache. And then because it took so long to get a dr's appointment: crushing fatigue where I semi pass out, continued headaches, anxiety, lethargy. Also triggered my period early because apparently stress. 

Now have better inhale and am slowly improving. Back up to 96, which is less terrifying. :)."
Asthma as a child,1,0.67,4,"(#1)Yes, that‚Äôs absolutely possible. Smoking is a huge risk for those with chronic lung issues. Stop smoking and see a doctor who can check your lung function and address any symptoms or discomfort you‚Äôre having. If you used to be on a controller medication they‚Äôll be able to recommend if you should go back on it now as an adult. 

Childhood asthma is said to sometimes go into something of a remission, but it‚Äôs very possible for it to come back in adulthood, especially when you have risk factors such as taking up smoking.(#2)yep . got a friend in your position .i  had more severeish asthma as a kid , didnt totally grow out of it but my symptoms highly improved . started smoking weed all came back(#3)Switch to edibles"
Prednisone,1,1.0,16,"(#1)I normally get 5-7 days of 40 mg. My doctor told me tapering isn't necessary if you use it less than two weeks.(#2)I was prescribed 40mg/day for 5 days with no taper for bronchitis exacerbating asthma. It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs helped to stop the wheezing and cough. First time I wasn‚Äôt given a taper dose.(#3)It really depends on how bad things are for me.(#4)I‚Äôve had 5/day for 5 or 7 days, 4/day for 7 days, 6-5-4-3-2-1, (6x3, 5x3, ‚Ä¶, 1x3), same thing but stepping down by 5 mg every three days, 4-6 for a week followed by stepping down 10 mg daily/every three days, any of the above but split it to take half the day‚Äôs dose twice a day ‚Ä¶

It depends on the flare, the prescriber, and to some extent the patient. I do not do well over 40 mg and I‚Äôve never noticed a big difference with splitting the dose, and I do have a history of my adrenal glands shutting down, so if I get a taper from my doctor (vs urgent care or the er) it tends to reflect that.

Edit: when I say 5/day, I mean 10 mg pills.(#5)They do normally have you taper off. Are you saying they've recommended the same dose for several days with no taper?(#6)I got 5 days of 50 mg and 5 days of 25 mg(#7)I tested positive for RSV.  Was prescribed Prednisone at 3 x 20mg/day for 5 days.  I believe it's working, but very slow.  This RSV is kicking my butt big time!(#8)Ok this is definitely a big dose for me, too many side effects. Will call doctor today to see best approach on lowering the dose."
Advice needed: residential hvac treatments worth it?,13,1.0,7,"(#1)WELCOME, WHEEZY SIBLING. We just had our HVAC system cleaned and it made a HUGE difference for me. I can't attest to what your experience will be, but my quality of sleep and overall breathing quality has improved a lot since we had our cleaning done. I had originally been thinking of just installing new filters (see my profile for thread asking about this) but I'm glad that I sprang for the professional cleaning instead. One caveat, though - it did kick up a LOT of very fine dust that took quite a while to settle down. The cleaners were very good and mostly managed to contain the dust blowback with their magic-cleany-things, but based on my symptoms I think that some very fine dust particles did linger for a while. I had some extra symptoms for a few days, but on the balance it was very worth it. If I had to do it over again the only thing I would change is going away for those few days after. Dust is one of my top triggers, I should add, so it was definitely worth it for me, but it would depend on what your triggers are, I think.(#2)I have an air purifier/scrubber on the HVAC of the house we just moved into, and I disabled it without seeing any difference.  I started doing some research on those, and I would be careful about the air purifier and duct cleaning.  If you look at the EPA site on Indoor Air Quality:

[https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq)

it says there is limited evidence that either are helpful.

There is a report ([https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-07/documents/residential\_air\_cleaners\_-\_a\_technical\_summary\_3rd\_edition.pdf](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-07/documents/residential_air_cleaners_-_a_technical_summary_3rd_edition.pdf)) with more details.  The site also points out that some have ozone as a by product.  The only sites I can find that say they work are places that make or sell them, and then they don't bother to actually share any peer reviewed scientific evidence - at least not that I've found.

I understand that some hospitals use UV lights for rooms, but in that situation, the UV light is likely on, and it's killing surface viruses and mold. In a residential HVAC, air is moving through the system at 600+ feet per minute, and the light shuts off when the blower isn't running. I would doubt it's on long enough to really work as advertised.

Duct sealing, appears to be something different though. It apparently has to do with energy efficiency...

[https://www.energystar.gov/campaign/heating\_cooling/duct\_sealing](https://www.energystar.gov/campaign/heating_cooling/duct_sealing)(#3)My neighbor has that and she said she sees just as much dust in her house as the previous HVAC system but ymmv.(#4)I live in the south east as well, and the UV air purifier is a *game changer*. It helps a lot with allergies and asthma, even with pets in the house. We have a company that provides regular service on the HVAC system and they‚Äôll replace any filters and lights as needed. Our purification system has been offline for a week (HVAC people coming tomorrow to fix it) and there‚Äôs been a noticeable difference in everyone‚Äôs symptoms, especially at night. Would definitely recommend it if the offers in your area seem reasonable!"
Anyone get their booster shot?,45,0.92,57,"(#1)Got moderna, didnt affect Asthma. Go for it!(#2)I got my booster and flu shot at the same time while I was feeling bad with my asthma and it didn't make it any worse. Obviously talk to your doctor and see how they feel about it.(#3)I was having a long bout of about 3 months of barely controlled asthma when I had my booster, with the thinking if I got sick while it was that bad I couldn't even even imagine how bad that would feel.   Two weeks later my asthma was so well controlled I actually forgot to take my preventative.   I have read some papers saying a booster can help with long tail covid that can present like asthma so that may be what happened.  But better safe than sorry is my thinking.(#4)Got moderna,(#5)Yep, got a Moderna booster atop two Pfizers.

Zero impact on asthma.(#6)Pfizer booster in December following 2 AZ doses. Like others my asthma was flared (cold weather and stress) and ‚Äúnot controlled‚Äù. I get side effects from most vaccines including annual flu jabs - and had strong side effects from the first AZ but for booster day after I was a tiny bit achey but nothing worse than the feeling the day after a gym workout! No impact on asthma except for a welcome reduction in stress (omicron was becoming a thing)!(#7)All 3 Pfizer. Got my booster in October before I did some traveling for a wedding. No issues. No side effects either except for a swollen lymph node. (I've been also taking extra vitamin d + drinking more water. So, could be that too.)(#8)Pfizer booster in September. Sore arm for a day. Glad I got it because everyone in my house caught covid over Xmas. We were almost all asymptomatic. One of us lost smell for half a day. No asthma exacerbations from the shots or booster.(#9)Maybe not as helpful, but I just got my third shot, the booster (Pfizer). My asthma is better recently, but for all 3 I haven't noticed any changes to my asthma.(#10)I got the Moderna booster and only had a sore arm for a day. I have friends and family with asthma who also got Pfizer and Moderna boosters that did not get any asthma symptoms. Get boosted!(#11)Just a heads up on singulair, I suffered from extreme suicidal ideation on that medication and had to be taken off. Just something to be mindful of when you start it.(#12)u/tarsha8nz was told to have it anyway.  I was on Prednisone because of my allergies and still had it.(#13)Got Pfizer booster and flu shot at the same time, no effect on asthma.  I had bad side effects from the second Pfizer shot.(#14)I was fine with both and didn‚Äôt get any bad reactions.(#15)I got my booster while my asthma was relatively bad. Usually it‚Äôs pretty mild and well controlled but the cold weather is a big trigger for me. I received Pfizer for all 3. For the first, I didn‚Äôt have a single side effect and for the second and booster, I just had a sore armpit (plus the sore arm for all three, of course). Given that it‚Äôs a safe vaccine and is meant to help protect people from respiratory illness, I was not concerned about getting the booster during a ‚Äúflare up‚Äù so to speak. I hope Singulair helps you and that you get your symptoms under control soon!! üíï(#16)I got my J&J booster back in mid-October. Got COVID in mid December (recovering now). I‚Äôve been told I should get an mRNA booster once I‚Äôm better or in a month or two. So far, no asthma flare ups to report beyond using my albuterol a handful of times.(#17)I got a full dose of Moderna because high doses of prednisone for weeks at a time every few months can affect how the vaccine works. I would not hesitate to get the vaccine during a flare up, the only way I would not take it is if you were currently on prednisone.(#18)I got my booster mid exacerbation before starting steroids. My pulmonologists recommendation was to get it as soon as possible.(#19)Ditto two pfizer shots, moderna booster. 

the worst was just the itchy welt at the injection site, but benadryl cream knocked that back. zero effect on my asthma.

there should not really be any issue with the asthma, but better to just get the booster now, and then sort the meds, i would think. The bigger beast is covid, sort that, then the asthma. otherwise you‚Äôre fighting covid AND asthma.(#20)I got my Modena booster in November. I had fatigue for a day.(#21)Get the booster. Some people experience side effects and some don't but I think respiratory side effects are extremely rare in any case.(#22)I was suppose to get my booster Dec. 26th but I caught Covid a few days before Christmas üòí. So I had to reschedule to Jan. 17th. I also wanted to protect myself. I was lucky not to end up getting hospitalized. My oxygen levels never got lower than 98% I did have to use my inhalor more frequently. The only symptoms I had from my 2 phizer shots where a very sore arm and being very tired for a few days. Hopefully that is all that happens when I get my booster üôÇ(#23)I got the pfizer booster during a bad flare with asthma. Made no difference and I had no side effects.(#24)Got Pfizer for all 3, and received the booster around Thanksgiving. There was no effect on my asthma at all!(#25)Got the booster, Phizer.  Strangely for me #1 was easy but more reaction then #2, and #2 was a nonevent.  The booster for me was the worst.  Knocked me out for a day at least... Maybe two... then sapped my energy for awhile kind of like I had a mild almost flu.  

Still recommend... but just remember too that this is a possible outcome.  So take it as it comes.(#26)I have a lot of chronic health issues including asthma and long covid, and the only reaction I had to the shots and the booster was a sore arm.(#27)I got the moderna booster and all it did was make me tired for a day or two. You should be fine getting the booster(#28)Don‚Äôt get a booster. It can give you a blood clot leading to heart attack or stroke(#29)Get it asap. It did not make my asthma worse, but can almost guarantee COVID will.(#30)Allergies and asthma been the worst this year üíØ anyone know why this year been so bad ?(#31)I got a third primary (full) dose a few days ago. No reason to wait. Worse to get covid while your asthma symptoms are bad‚Ä¶.(#32)Pfizer for all three. Booster resulted in Covid arm for about 3 weeks. Didnt seem to affect my asthma which has been pretty bad these past few months.(#33)My dad lives in Rome, Italy and  had his booster shot moderna, half dose advice by the italian Health department. He suffers from ashma and considered in danger situation if he ever contracted covid virus without getting vaccinated.

He did 2 covid test yesterday since he had coughs Six days ago. He Is covid positive and fortunaely he Is foing fine and in 10 days quarantine. My 7 year old nephew and my sister lives with my dad and they are positive too. My nephew Is not vaccinated and had for 3 days High Fever ,coughs and cold. Today She Is fine. My sister Instead starts having cough and headaches today. My mom Is vaccinated with booster shot and Is negative at the Moment but She was with my Father 2 days ago. Probably She Will be positive too in the next coming days. fortunaely they are doing well. The covid vaccine protected my family and i am so Happy about It.

My mom and dad are 63 and 64 years old with 2 Pfizer vaccine and a moderna booster. My sister Is 32 years old with Johnson vaccine and a moderna booster. I am 40 this january and i have both Pfizer vaccine waiting for the third booster on April. My sister and my dad are ashmatic.(#34)Yes. 2 + 1 Pfizer. No unusual side effects(#35)Yes, get your booster.  It's not even really a booster, as Pfizer and Moderna both claim that a 3rd shot is necessary to protect against the O variant.

Also make sure you get a flu shot if you haven't already.  Flurona is spreading and a great threat to people with asthma.(#36)Got moderna and nothing happened!(#37)All 3 Pfizer, all fine apart from having a nap during lunchtime the following day (which I usually don't, took a longer lunch break).(#38)Singulair helped me so much. My asthma has been super bad lately (Texas), and I got the booster last week. My arm hurt a lot but otherwise I was A OK. No breathing issues. Not even a fever. Slight headache and arm pain but that‚Äôs all. Pfizer for all 3 of my shots(#39)Boosted with Pfizer. Just a sore arm. Flu shot. A few days of immune system reaction. 

Go for it.(#40)Mine was scheduled for Friday, but yesterday I realized I had no sense of smell. Came back positive on a rapid test, so I‚Äôm in for an interesting week. But I got my initial shots in spring at the height of my seasonal asthma and had no affect to my asthma(#41)Got my Moderna booster and flu shot together. Two separate arms. Only had a headache for about 24-36 hours, and sore arms. The Covid side was worse but nothing unbearable.(#42)Booster was fine, singulair is a GODSEND, good luck(#43)I got my first two vaccines, but decided not to get a booster. I upped the amount of vitamin D I was taking since that has a big impact on outcomes with covid, and also take vitamin c, zinc, and k. 

I'm waiting for results of a test now, but almost definitely have omnicron. First day was a but rough with cold sweats, chills, a few other symptoms. I've been really tired for the last few days, and my breathing has been impacted slightly, but I haven't needed to use my rescue inhaler. Just sleeping a lot.

I'm not going to try and convince people not to take a booster, but for me, it seemed like just bumping my vitamin d in combination of how much less severe omnicron is seems like the way to go. If you do get a booster it still seems like a good idea. After finding out about how almost everyone who doesn't eat traditional fish based diet or spend all day outside is d deficient, I'm going to be supplimenting for the rest of my life.(#44)Got it without issue. That said, having Covid and asthma could be very bad. Vaccine better.(#45)Yeah, the only side effect for me from the booster was a sore upper arm for a few days.(#46)I got my first covid shot when my asthma still wasn‚Äôt great and I was recovering from what felt like a cracked rib from coughing so hard. It didn‚Äôt effect my healing/well being at all and it shouldn‚Äôt anyway I‚Äôd imagine. Most of the stuff you MIGHT experience (which would be minimal now that it‚Äôs a booster) isn‚Äôt even a real sickness or anything, so I don‚Äôt feel like it would really do much if that makes sense.(#47)When i first got my booster i had some congestion . i felt okay . i had my usual side effects , and now i am feeling the allergies are a bit worse and i am
Having more wheezing but nothing too crazy . My last shot was a lot worse . i believe it was cause it was the summer my asthma was way worse but i am
Now using flovant so my ‚Äú side effects ‚Äú are much better(#48)I needed to see this post and all the reassuring comments from people ü§é I was worried about this too.(#49)I got boosted within a month of the FDA saying I could (I put it off one week for an athletic event). I had no asthma effects from the booster or from either of the first two Pfizer doses, nor did my asthmatic spouse for any of his three rounds of Moderna. The worst either of us had from the boosters was a sore arm.(#50)You still get those?(#51)Boosted with Moderna after a J&J single dose. No significant side effects to any of mine. Both my partner and BIL had two Pfizer then Moderna booster, and the booster  knocked them out for 24 hours. Both my parents had three Pfizer and had no side effects from the booster. No asthma for partner, BIL, nor mother, but my father has some asthma-like symptoms due to previously having lung cancer and one lobe removed. No asthma reactions to any of them, though he did have flu-like side effects to the first two, no side effects from the booster. He always gets flu-like side effects to vaccines though, so that‚Äôs nothing new to him.(#52)I got Pfizer (have now had 3 shots of it) and it didn't affect my asthma at all. I was sore all over everywhere except my arm(???) for a couple of days and felt a bit groggy, but miles better compared to my second jab where I was very ill after.(#53)I got my first dose of Phizer and had a bad asthma flair up from it. Really tight chest and sore achy diaphragm. However this was because my asthma was not controlled at all and I had just recently gotten diagnosed with it. I‚Äôve held off on the second shot because I‚Äôm scared of it happening again but my asthma is now much more under control. I‚Äôm not a doctor but I think at worse you will have some achy lungs if you have any flair up at all."
Albuterol inhaler no longer helping with severe wheezing,21,0.94,43,"(#1)The same thing happened to me after pneumonia. My doctor explained that albuterol helps opening the airways, but not with the mucus. So the problem is that asthma makes your body produce mucus, which does not get better with albuterol. The trigger could be a virus or bacteria, in my case it was a bacteria(#2)What did you doctor say? I‚Äôve been having the same issue(#3)If you are using your albuterol more than 2-3 times a week, your doctor should have put you on a controller a long time ago. Overuse of albuterol causes it to loose effectiveness over time.(#4)I was having the same problem last week and it turned out I have Covid. It was my only symptom for almost a week. Other than my breathing, I felt fine until I woke up this morning feeling awful in every way.(#5)It sounds like you have an exacerbation of your asthma. Are you on an inhaled steroid and long-acting bronchodilator to help control symptoms long-term? Sounds like your asthma is simply not well-controlled and if you don‚Äôt have an asthma/allergist, you probably need one. When my asthma is unstable (it happens, that is the nature of asthma), you may also need a short course of prednisone. An allergist is really the best doctor to help you stabilize your asthma. 

Albuterol is supposed to be a rescue inhaler but when it doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs time for plan B.(#6)I use xopenex,but yeah, that happens to me when my exacerbation has reached a point of needing steroids or a zpack. Something to add to the plan of care due to the inflammation. After, that starts working, the xopenex does too. So I guess the severity of it? I know using it too often can create less effectiveness as well.(#7)Happened to me, now I just need a nebulizer for some attacks. It‚Äôs not super often, maybe once every 2-3 months now? But yeah I have a portable mesh one I take with me when it‚Äôs really bad and use maybe like 1/3-3/4 a vial of duoneb. I had to advocate hard for it, but they finally gave me the prescription after I had an ER trip.

In my case, I‚Äôd have basically no daily symptoms but my attacks would just escalate super super fast and never fully resolve causing this domino effect where they just kept getting worse and worse until I got the neb. Now, I can have a bad attack and be pretty much fine within 24-48 hours. If that sounds like what‚Äôs going on with you, would highly recommend asking for it.

If it‚Äôs constant and not a trigger you can pinpoint, my money is on a cold turned chest infection or COVID. That calls for prednisone, horayyyyyy‚Ä¶.

other than that, I like to do 2 puffs every 8 hours with chest infections to help with the garbage breathing. Can‚Äôt remember which doctor suggested this, but works wonders. If it‚Äôs viral, also recommend mucinex DM to clear your chest out.(#8)This happened to me last week and my dr prescribed me Flovent ( a steroid inhaler) which has helped tremendously. Only thing now is I have a gnarly cough that won‚Äôt go away(#9)go to an allergist or pulmonologist to get your asthma under control.  I swear my allergist has me so much better than I have ever been.(#10)An inhaler depends on you being able to pull enough medicine into your lungs for it to be able to do its job. Sometimes if an exacerbation is bad enough your lungs just aren't pulling in enough Albuterol to help you feel better. That's when you need a nebulizer treatment, which is a much more effective delivery mechanism.

This kind of flare-up can happen for a number of reasons. A virus could be a trigger, or an allergen or air pollution, and sometimes the cause isn't obvious.

When a flare-up happens, you should talk to your doctor about upping the dosage of your controller meds and/or doing a short round of steroids to get things under control again.(#11)This was an ongoing issue for me until yesterday when I went to see an ENT doctor and asked that he do an endoscopy of my throat. I thought I had uncontrolled asthma, and that still may be the case, but he also found that I have LPR (laryngopharyngeal reflux disease). I have woken up in the middle of the night unable to breathe thinking that it was out of control asthma, but this same thing does happen with LPR as well.

Besides that, using albuterol more than necessary does make it lose its efficacy, per the PA at the urgent care I went to. Of course, I am not a medical professional and I just learned about all of this yesterday, so please go see a doctor when you can!(#12)Happened to me in November. My oxygen dropped to 85 so I called EMS, went to the ER and spent three days in the hospital.(#13)Sounds like you need s controller inhaler to improve your lungs. If you can, do cardio to help improve your lungs.  Rescue inhalers are more emergency and went fix the problem"
"Only double vaxxed, du for booster in 2 months",2,0.75,11,"(#1)I had it over Christmas and my asthma was fine and literally no issues until about a week afterward (may or may not be related to having had covid idk?) when I couldn‚Äôt stop wheezing and to this day have a bad cough and am on a steroid inhaler(#2)You will in all likelihood be totally fine - bit definitely get boosted! Keep up with your meds and test if you get any symptoms(#3)Omicron may be better for asthmatics than previous versions, as it doesn‚Äôt seem to live as deep in the lungs as other variants ‚Äî this is both why it‚Äôs less deadly, and more easily transmissible.(#4)Asthmatics typically have a better outcome than average. Asthma is not currently considered a risk factor by the CDC. Omicron is also less serious than previous variants. Take your meds. Take care of your health. Try to stop freaking out ..you'll be okay.(#5)I just haven't been able to get my booster. Have omicron rn. First two days really sucked, third day I started feeling better and it's continued so far. I'm classified as moderate asthma. My most annoying thing I've noticed is my resting heart rate has been elevated since I started showing symptoms(#6)I'd recommend having all your meds ready and taking your controllers diligently, you can increase your dosage if necessary (similar to getting a cold).(#7)No reason to worry about it is just a mild my family had it"
New Regulations on Asthma Treatment,1,1.0,0,
peak flow higher at work,7,1.0,10,"(#1)Hi.  Long-time asthmatic/peak flow user here!

A 10% variance in measurements is expected, and there are times of day where it's naturally a little higher or lower.

What you want to track is your highest possible measurement (550) and be concerned with **drops of more than** ~~80%~~ **20%** (ie. below 440) as that is the indication asthma symptoms are not sufficiently controlled.

Typically you are to take 3 measurements at the same time and record the best.  You shouldn't be doing this more than 2x daily, unless you're feeling you're having breathing problems - then you can check.  But doing too many of these can really tire you out/exacerbate things!

Hope this helps a bit!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Edited (in bold, strikethrough) to correct my backwards math!(#2)[deleted](#3)Where there is virtually no variance, your peak flows would be considered normal for the average healthy adult.(#4)For instance I checked yesterday when I was off (at home) at 9am and 2pm. It wouldn't go above 530. Here at work it's 550.(#5)Little back story. I had covid pneumonia October 31st. I feel like I have asthma. I had a pft Nov 29 that stated no.  Well I'm still having symptoms.  I don't know if this is just normal recovering from mild pneumonia or I do have asthma and they just aren't catching it"
Air Purifier Suggestion,3,0.81,9,"(#1)Medify MA-40. 
Top notch and worth every penny. (Got mine for $216 on Amazon). 
It has the super effective H13 HEPA filter. 

I also have a small, lower end one by Blue Air. It‚Äôs decent.(#2)https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-air-purifier/

I own a few of the Coway.

Ideally you would have one in every room or so. If you can only get one, wherever your symptoms are worse. Run it 24/7 on medium.(#3)I was suggested to buy a HEPA type(#4)Austin Air Purifier' Healthmate Plus is the way to go. Yes, it's expensive but worth it. Run it in your bedroom while you sleep, and the room becomes an Allergy Free Zone, a clean air sanctuary for asthmatics. The unit removes an extensive range of allergen particulates, including chemicals, that pollute household air and trigger breathing difficulties. Relief for Asthma sufferers includes a good allergist; the right meds, nutritional supplements, diet; and the Austin Healmate Plus air purifier.  Austin has several models but the Healthmate Plus is the most effective.(#5)i bought a nice little holmes brand one for right next to my bed and a second one for next to my computer (2 spots i spend the most time at at home). just need to go buy new filter lol. but a hepa type one in any size (depending on room and need) would work(#6)I own two from Winix (True HEPA), one for the bedroom and another for the living room. I got them at Costco when they went on sale around $170 for each unit, and Costco also carries the filters where you save big on them.  If I may, also check your air conditioning/furnace filters (if you have one) and make the upgrade to a higher quality filter there as well. Both have made a big difference in my daily symptoms.  Wishing you easy breathing, friend!"
Covid - Fully Vaxed,6,0.88,7,"(#1)With omicron, there are lots of breakthrough cases. I'm back to quarantining because people in my area don't mask and they treat covid like a joke.(#2)Im on day 8 of covid today. Only symptoms left are a bad cough and getting short of breath very easily. The first 3-4 days i thought I was going to die.   The horrible pains, fever,  my heart racing non stop for days. Just a horrible experience over all.

Im not sure if I have asthma. Im being tested for it and was waiting to see my pulmonologist next month. My O2 for some reason only dropped when i would be sleeping to 90 but itd go up quickly. Itd do that a few times during the night.

My peak flow which is usually 720-740 normally, was/is 670-720.  Feels like im breathing fine, bur i guess im just weak in general due to covid making me get slightly lower numbers(#3)Yes, omicron is highly highly infectious(#4)I'm 43, two J&J shots because I'm allergic to the others. My husband felt sick Tuesday, had a negative test at work Wednesday, but we think it may have been too soon. Thursday night I had fever, cough and sore throat, and it hasn't changed much since. My kids are both sick too, one of them has had two doses of Pfizer but had an anaphylactic reaction to the second dose, so she can't get a booster. The other has had two doses of moderna. She's barely sick, she coughs now and then when I ask her to do something, but she's doing the best out of all of us.

I couldn't find a place to get tested here without paying ER copays, so I ordered tests, which will be here tomorrow, so I guess we'll see.(#5)Vaxxed but not boosted. Started showing symptoms 3 days ago. Mostly congestion, coughing, and headache, though my lower back does hurt today. No wheezing (but I like never wheeze) and my asthma doesn't seem flared. I do think I have an ear infection as well though(#6)Mine started out mild, basically a cold with extreme fatigue. I took a turn today though (day 5) my chest hurts, my lungs burn, and I‚Äôm developing a nasty cough. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be too uncommon to take a turn after a few days, so, watch out for that(#7)My BIL got it a couple days after his booster. It was like a moderate cold for him. He and a bunch of friends all got it after they ate dinner outside together. All of them were freshly boosted EXCEPT my BIL‚Äôs gf. She was a few weeks out after her booster and did not get it. 

It‚Äôs kinda scary that they were outside and got it. Unmasked and of course close together, but still, that used to be safe with previous variants. They don‚Äôt know which of them brought it to the group, or if it was the server or even someone just passing by."
Reducing frequency of Dupixent shots?,1,0.67,2,(#1)I haven‚Äôt but I‚Äôm curious to know about others experience! I‚Äôd love to reduce mine as well.(#2)I‚Äôm pretty sure the recommended dose is every 2 weeks. Why would you change it if it‚Äôs working well? (If it ain‚Äôt broke‚Ä¶)
New doc new tests,4,1.0,1,(#1)It's not wrong but don't get your hopes too high. Most insurances don't like to cover biologics and it can be a nightmare to get them to approve them.
Am I able to pop these vents out to have the cleaned? What's the best way to clean them without professional help? I have one right over my bed.,3,0.81,15,"(#1)Used to clean air ducts for a living, doing it yourself isn't really an option.  You can clean the vents yourself, but the duct work where most of the dirt, abd dust is you'll need professionals.  And like almost stuff, you get what you pay for.(#2)Usually there are screws on both sides. May be hard to see from far away(#3)2 screws usually and the box part will pull away from the sheet metal vent and get dust/debris all over what's under it (usually my eyeballs). They sell long brushes for cleaning them but a vacuum brush with long attachment works fine.(#4)I hope you don‚Äôt have forced hot air. If so, your ducts should be cleaned at least once a year. If I go on vacation or stay at someone‚Äôs house just one night w forced air, my asthma is horrendous for days. Dust and mold get stuck in vents for months and it‚Äôs awful for those of us with breathing issues.(#5)I would mask up and go with a vacuum hose. I would wash my hands and vacuum the room after to get any clumps that fall."
I plan on moving and working abroad but i have ashtma...,5,0.86,6,(#1)You request a copy of your medical records from your current doctor to provide to any new doctors you will see there. This should be your standard practice whether you are moving or just changing doctors.(#2)Hope this helps https://www.expatica.com/de/healthcare/healthcare-basics/german-healthcare-system-103359/
Best cities for asthma?,34,0.93,72,"(#1)I can't give you a solid recommendation, but I would like to recommend the book 'Breath: The new science of a lost art' by James Nestor. I'm a lifelong asthmatic and this really changed my life.(#2)I posted something similar a few weeks ago! Avoid the Ohio Valley! It‚Äôs so rough here. The weather is never consistent and the pollen and other environmental allergies have caused me a lot of problems. We are looking at other options too! My Doctor did say to be aware that if we moved I might go through a honeymoon phase. My allergies would improve for maybe 4-6 months and then once my body realized what was happening I would react to those allergens. I have severe asthma so I completely understand how you feel! Good luck to you!(#3)I know you asked about best cities but Florida has done wonders for my life dealing with asthma(#4)Avoid cities because pollution makes asthma and worse. But,  climate is changing so fast,  it's hard to know.  In Colorado we now have fire season to content with. I think everyone asthma is just getting generally worse. I moved back to Colorado because I'm allergic to so many molds. Was much better for several years.  The then we started having fire season.(#5)I've seen a few people mention Florida, and that is a viable option as long as humidity does not bother you. My mom relocated to Florida for her asthma, but mine was far worse every time I went to visit because of the humidity. If humidity is an issue, drier climates may be a better option.(#6)Anywhere coastal Florida is my advice! Don‚Äôt move to Atlanta, pollution is a big problem! Good luck.(#7)I'm not sure where the best place to be is, but I can tell you not to move to Denver, Colorado. They have terrible air quality for asthmatics. Plus, there's the wild fires every year and Denver gets hit and so does Cheyenne, Wyoming. Probably everywhere in between those two cities too.  I have asthma and I've been debating moving too. I'm wondering if coastal cities with the humidity or sea air might be better? Or maybe that's too wet?(#8)Moved to San Diego from Michigan and my asthma has dramatically improved. Rarely have any attacks anymore.(#9)Just chiming in. If your asthma gets aggravated by the cold do not move to Chicago or most cities in the Midwest.(#10)Not LA(#11)B.C.(#12)[deleted](#13)If you like the desert still, Las Vegas has really low pollution. There‚Äôs natural occurring ozone cause of the sun. But it‚Äôs rare.(#14)If you are wanting to stay in UT for some reason the air quality in Eagle Mountain is better. Since moving out here I have a lot less problems in winter. I do however have issues every August for some reason, the best my dr and I can figure is allergies but we aren‚Äôt sure what the specific thing is, so that may or may not be an issue for you.(#15)When I stayed in San Antonio TX for a month my asthma symptoms disappeared over night! I believe it was the general lack of plant life (compared to where I live) and the dry, warm air. It was really amazing. That was the longest I've been in my life without using a rescue inhaler. The very day I got back in my home state ( NE Georgia) I started wheezing.(#16)Miami seems to have very low pollution and the air is not dry at all.(#17)I moved from MN to PAC NW and my breathing improved dramatically.  I also moved into a sterile condo on the 25th floor.(#18)Florida was perfect for me.  NY and the cold dry weather is brutal on my lungs but always hot and humid air in central Florida served me just right, never even touched my inhaler down south(#19)Hey fellow Utahn! The dry, cold, inversions always flare my asthma. When I lived in a humid hot state, the humidity would sometimes flare it because it felt like so much more work with almost chewy air. I‚Äôve always thought if I had to relocate, I would do Montana (clearer than Utah), or Washington to add some humidity in. When you find some place that works for you, let us know what it is!(#20)There is no best city because everyone's asthma is different.

Avoid the south if politics is an issue. I'm in FL and these yahoos act like global warming/climate change is a fraud perpetrated by democrats just to scare people.(#21)Anywhere but dallas tx.(#22)Any coastal desert climate or desert city. Avoid big cities like LA unless can afford to live on the beach. San Diego all the way up to Sonoma country (Skip SF due to fog, although Berkeley is fine except on bad pollution days) would be good. That is where I am aiming. The trick is to avoid humidity and air pollution from vehicles. 

The big issue with CA and other desert climates is the annual forest fires (Getting worse every year), so you'd need to have good filtered air con in house, car and office. When air pollution was bad in LA when I lived there, I used nose filters when out and about, barely anyone noticed me wearing them. Only good for PM though.(#23)I used to live in Utah and the air pollution was terrible.  The inversions really triggered my asthma.  It's the worst place I've ever lived for air pollution.(#24)I spent a few years in Laramie, WY, and my asthma loved it. I wasn‚Äôt allergic to anything there (sagebrush is what most people react to there). Elevation gave me mild altitude sickness but didn‚Äôt affect my asthma at all. And humid air is a trigger and it‚Äôs really dry there. It was awesome, I really miss that aspect of Laramie (though not many others).(#25)Austin is horrible with the allergens here"
Alternative treatments for exercise induced asthma,7,0.89,25,"(#1)Uh, you need to be a on a steroid inhaler.(#2)I‚Äôm confused as to why your doctor doesn‚Äôt have you on a daily inhaler and only have you on the rescue. Symbicort has helped me immensely. You should inquire!(#3)Have they checked your eosinophils and neutrophilic levels? (Spelling may be off) I have adult on set neutrophilic asthma, and over the last 7 years I went from being able to live a normal life to not being able to walk up 6 steps. It causes a dramatic crash in quality of life and can be difficult to diagnose and treat.(#4)Singular for exercise imduced asthma(#5)dude, get a steroid inhaler. dulera is pricey, but similar ones have generics you can get from online canadian pharmacies pretty cheap.(#6)If you do not have relief from an inhaler, it's not asthma.

I'm a severe asthmatic and distance runner. As long as I use  my controller, I rarely ever have issues with any distance.(#7)Are you on a non steroid prevention inhaler? Have you stuck to anything longer than a month? Sometimes it takes a little bit to start seeing some results, you can‚Äôt just stop taking it a little bit in because you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs doing anything. What has your chest doctor said?(#8)As an alternative to exercise induced asthma, look into hyperventilation syndrome (I am an asthmatic with that and go through months-long bouts of exercise intolerance despite having 100% controlled asthma for over a decade) and see if that fits?  I have found *some* relief from Buteyko breathing exercises - theoretically if I remained more devoted to the practice instead of just using it during flare-ups, I would experience more long-lasting relief.

I think long term stress (ie. living through this pandemic for starters) is a contributing factor as the nervous system is kept amped up.  Just my personal opinion on my own issues, if that helps you at all.  I am also doing more yoga and meditation, cutting down caffeine, etc.

Good luck!!!(#9)Sea moss, Mullein leaf herbal tea, controlled deep breathing exercises one of the best, alkaline diet dr.sebi, steam"
Air Hunger: A Rant,33,0.95,16,"(#1)Then the lungs get tired from the manual breathing.(#2)My doctor won‚Äôt prescribe prednisone to me anymore. I got diabetes after taking prednisone too much. My doctor figured out that my A1C would sharply rise after a round of prednisone. I‚Äôm allergic to NSAIDs, so I don‚Äôt have many options to reduce inflammation. Asthma sucks. Inflammation sucks. Diabetes sucks. 

Thanks for starting this rant. I needed to vent!(#3)I have struggled with air hunger a lot . i had no idea it was an asthma thing . plus that year i struggled with air hunger my asthma acted up all the time(#4)I hear you.  I feel like a goldfish out of my bowl, gasping for every breath.  It's awful.  You are not alone.(#5)I feel you! I‚Äôm also on prednisone (50mg) and regular inhalers. I caught pneumonia in december and since then I‚Äôm having attacks all the time. Prednisone really just started helping after like 5 days. Now I‚Äôm feeling much better, still with a few attacks here and there, but overall so much better.
I hope you‚Äôll feel better soon! Sometimes it takes a while for prednisone to really kick in(#6)I really try to be careful and practice controlled coughing if I start to cough. Ug. It's so painful.(#7)So, you guys will get a kick out of this and also be horrified. 

So, my asthmas has been exacerbated for over a week. I have been struggle bussing through and doing so many nebulizer treatments I was worried about albuterol overdoes. Turns out, the person doing the data entry at the doctors office, who has likely been overwhelmed and stressed, made a typo on my prednisone script. 1 mg does not equal 10 mg. I visited my pulmonologist this morning and he figured it out. I have been taking 5 mg, not 50 mg, of prednisone and tanking. No wonder I've had such terrible air hunger! So, I have my new proper script and will be checking mgs religiously going forward. My nose is already cleared and my chest feels great. Our poor healthcare folks need a break.(#8)Amen Brothers and Sisters ! (Gasp).(#9)Exhausting chronic issue. Just got over an exacerbation, feels like another is coming. Truly exhausting. I don't think trelegy is doing its job for me. Hope you feel better soon üí´"
Possible to loose weight after a 5 day steroid taper?,2,0.75,13,"(#1)Losing weight is absolutely no big deal especially with such a teeny, tiny course of steroids. You may have simply lost weight because you aren't eating all the holiday treats anymore.(#2)I‚Äôm just hoping it was from the steroid and not something more serious. I have been eating 3 meals a day and a dessert most days but not seeing the scale go up as it should(#3)Only some steroid medications cause weight gain. 

Prednisone is essentially artificial cortisol so it raises insulin levels which can make you more hungry and then cortisol also increases your propensity towards storing fat. 

Doesn't mean you will gain weight. Especially when it's a temporary taper. It's not like you've been on the stuff for a prolonged period of time.(#4)It also causes water retention which is reversible and could account for a few pounds.(#5)This happens to me whenever I'm on 30-40 mg pred. Not any other dose, just that dose.(#6)I‚Äôve just come off of 4 weeks of Pred and the moon face is real üò© I‚Äôm hoping it goes down soon‚Ä¶I think it‚Äôs mostly water retention.(#7)I lose weight on prednisone, every time. I usually lose ten pounds when I take prednisone for 3 days, and the weight doesn't come back later.(#8)I lose weight on prednisone, it kills my appetite near completely."
Asthma and Omicron,10,1.0,8,"(#1)Sounds like a question for your doctor.(#2)Please take it easy. Someone I know who is in really good shape, is a nurse at a hospital, 40f and got omicron about two weeks ago. Her asthma did bother her a bit and after she thought she was on the mend, started exercising again and now has pneumonia. You need to give your lungs as well as your heart a break and time to heal and not over work them."
Mom of a newly diagnosed 4yo.,23,0.97,14,"(#1)How scary! I'm sorry you're all going through that, it's a lot to adjust to. My sister had asthma as a child and grew out of it.  I was fine as a child but grew into it as an adult, it's all very unpredictable.

What happens next for your child will depend on the specifics of the case, so your doctor is the best person to get answers from right now. That said, one question you might want to ask them is whether or not it would make sense to invest in a nebulizer to have at your home. If you're in the USA, they're usually under $100, can be ordered off of Amazon, and if your doctor is willing to prescribe the medication for it, having one at home can spare everyone the stress and cost of a middle-of-the-night ER run.

Before I relocated, my doctor recommended that I buy my own nebulizer, because I lived in a rural area. Getting care quickly, especially in winter, was a challenge, so having the machine and meds at home was a big help.(#2)If it is asthma I recommend reading up on it. I liked the book ""asthma for dummies"" as I was recently diagnosed and had no idea about it beforehand. It's a good introduction and actually goes into a lot of detail, not at all what the title suggests.

Crossing my fingers for your family! The medication is very good these days, and though it might need to be taken regularly for a longer time or forever, it doesn't need to impact quality of life at all :) I take my controller inhaler in the morning and evening and forget about asthma for the rest of the day.
If you look up famous people with ashma you will be surprised and probably know quite a few!(#3)Ugh I‚Äôm so sorry. You never grow out of asthma it just becomes dormant as an adult sometimes. Best thing you can do is get them allergy tested, figure out what‚Äôs triggering the asthma. Have a rescue inhaler, nebulizer as well if possible. A peak flow meter is handy. Really figuring out the triggers is going to help immensely and avoid them.(#4)Man, I don't know how this helps for a kid who is so young, mine showed up early but not that early. I spent years coughing and having trouble breathing and just being under the belief that was a normal human experience.

It's good you know. Keep them going to a doctor, keep them using all the medication they're supposed to, and PLEASE BE READY AND WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES TO AVOID THEIR ATHASMA TRIGGERS.  I lived for years in a home that had cats that I had trouble breathing around and it was the absolute worst.  Also do the work to figure out what's causing it.  I didn't know until I was in high school that I was athma-allergic to cats and after college that I was the same for dogs.  Don't just willy nilly assume random things cause athasma - remove one thing from the house at a time and watch their symptoms.  For cats and dogs - I guess watch them during a vacation or something, because allergens will stick around for a month+ after the animals are gone.

Or get allergen tests from a specialist if you can.

Avoid giving them too many steroids if you can/use as low a dose as you can (or probably listen to your doctors on this).  If they  have symptoms use them, if they don't keep them away because they do have side effects and are best avoided.

Always make sure they have plenty of medicine, especially in their teenage and college years when they might be trying to go it on their own and can't get access to it on their own.

They'll be fine, though.(#5)Some children do grow out of their asthma , MANY of my little cousins had asthma grew up and their asthma is either gone or well controlled . as for me i wasnt lucky but i do suffer from many allergies but i can say i have improved :)(#6)Told my son would outgrow it. Gets less and less each year and he‚Äôs 10 now. Maybe needs inhalers 1-2 times per year . 

Can I ask how the ER was? As bad as news makes it out to be.(#7)My son is turning 3 soon and has asthma. He‚Äôs been diagnosed for over a year now. He takes Flovent daily and has an albuterol rescue inhaler. It really only gets
bad when he‚Äôs got a cold/respiratory virus and it sparks an asthma exacerbation. When it does, we switch to the nebulizer with either albuterol or Atrovent.(#8)If she's in in person school make sure they FULLY understand. And Dr will write notes excusing PE if needed. 

My only issues were actually when I went to high school. Even with asthma history I was forced to run during p.e. It was not a good situation. 

Invest in a good air purifier. And always have a second rescue inhaler on hand just in case.(#9)If you can afford one, air purifiers are great. Dust and other allergens can be issues for those with asthma. Hopefully she grows out of it somewhat when she gets older."
Anyone on Prozac and albuterol?,1,1.0,3,"(#1)I take both and never had an interaction (that I know)(#2)My daughter takes both, with no interaction that we've ever noticed.(#3)Yep!! Should be all good :)"
Lost my voice,8,1.0,12,"(#1)I'm so sorry you're going through this. Not being able to breath ""normal"" is so scary. Hugs to you.

When you do your inhaled treatments, you must swish your mouth to rinse out the medicine. It can cause thrush. Thrush can make your mouth feel weird and you can loose your voice. Any chance of that?(#2)I also had it when starting my meds. My voice started sounding like Im in puberty haha. I found out pretty fast how much it helped drinking a lot after taking the med. The side effect completely disappeared after one or two weeks after drinking some water everytime I used it

Edit: When I dont drink something afterwards it comes back after some days(#3)I never had covid but when i get very sick i lose my voice as well and when i laugh my voice ‚Äú squeaks ‚Äú i actually heard of another asthmatic covid patient who went thru something the same(#4)Definitely swish and gargle after every use. While thrush is usually noticeable at the back of the throat, it IS possible to get it on just your vocal chords, in which case you won‚Äôt be able to see it. This happened to me a couple of years ago.(#5)Please be careful. Someone I know, also a nurse got omicron two weeks ago and has asthma. She was on the mend and then got pneumonia so def something to watch out for, as you know."
Forgot last night's simbycort dose,1,1.0,3,(#1)One missed dose shouldn't affect anything(#2)one missed dose you should be fine :) it is usually singulair if you skip a dose the day after if you are around triggers your asthma can act up(#3)Ur most probably gonna be completely fine
A Few Questions: Switching Meds and Doctors,2,1.0,8,"(#1)There are so many inhalers out there. Advair,  breo, symbicort, qvar, etc. I'd find a new dr.(#2)I've had to switch meds many times when they lose effectiveness. It sounds like it's time to switch doctors if your doctor is not willing to see patients.(#3)There are 3 colors for asthma, assuming you're on yellow, ask to try red since it has more of the steroid.  If this doesn't work, there are still other options but you'll probably need to see a specialist.(#4)Ask to go on symbicort. I hear nothing but good stuff about that inhaler . i am on flovant , was on advair before ( long painful stupid story lmao ) but yeah . flovant also works really well"
"Nothing new, just a mini-rant ... those of asthma are always in a bit of a minefield",23,0.9,15,"(#1)‚Äúso whatcha allergic to?‚Äù 

me ‚Äúmother nature in all her splendor. I can go to the tulip gardens but pardon me while i consider snorting crushed claritin off the back of the toilet tank like i‚Äôm at some nightclub.‚Äù 

There was a period where a CK perfume was hugely popular and damned if that didn‚Äôt make my lungs shriek at the merest whiff. I‚Äôve dashed out of stores and subway cars when someone swimming in eau de stank comes on and suddenly the air is unbreathable. 

‚Äúavoid triggers.‚Äù Ok. got a ticket to mars? That might help.:D(#2)‚ÄúOh, you don‚Äôt like the smell‚Äù /eyeroll(#3)A colleague was setting chalk in the hallway at school with cheap hair spray and laughed it off when I said it was going to trigger my asthma.(#4)I recently (last week) had to go to ED for my allergies.  I told the dr that I was house sitting, I think the cat must have gotten in my room somehow (which is strange since he is rather antisocial), my allergy to the dogs has gotten worse, at the moment NZ has a bigger pollen issue than normal for this time of year, someone near me was wearing perfume at church, they used latex gloves for the sacrament and I appear to have developed a slight allergy to the type of face mask I was using.  My discharge summary suggested I ‚Äúwork out what triggers I have and avoid them in the future‚Äù.  It‚Äôs frustrating because it feels like he didn‚Äôt listen to a word I said.  The only reason I went was because taking an extra antihistamine did nothing once the latex became involved and I didn‚Äôt want to wait and maybe have to use my epi pen. 

The good news was that they had a sign up saying it was a 6 to 8 hour wait for none urgent patients and I was taken straight away because the receptionist saw that my lips were a little swollen.  I have, in the past, almost had to use my epi pen in the waiting room because the receptionist didn‚Äôt think I was sick enough for the ‚Äúred button‚Äù.(#5)Oh yes, I can now smell a spray can and nail polish from so far away, my boyfriend says it's like a circus trick. Yesterday we went walking, I smelled that chemical smell, told him, turns out they were painting something much further down the street.

Covid is scaring the shit out of me,38,0.9,44,"(#1)I have a friend who is asthmatic and had Omicron. She had harsh coughing. Burning congestion in nasal/forehead area. Mild fever. Temp disregulation. The 5th day she lost her taste, smell and appetite. She‚Äôs on day 8 now and doing much better. It didn‚Äôt impact her lungs of breathing and didn‚Äôt trigger her asthma. Hope that helps.(#2)I just recently finished my bout with Covid, presumably Omicron. My asthma did not flare up in any way during the entire week I had symptoms. I didn't use my inhaler once. In contrast, with the average cold I get, I'll use my inhaler 3-4 times a day. 

All sources I've read have indicated Asthma is not an underlying condition at risk for COVID. Some actually indicated Asthmatics for whatever reason are better prepared for COVID.(#3)I have moderate to severe asthma, take a high dose corticosteroid inhaler daily as well as biologics. I tested positive on Monday, had a high fever, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, fatigue. I went to urgent care at my doctor's practice and was referred for monoclonal antibodies and given a script for Prednisone. Infusion Thursday evening, steroids have kicked in, and I am feeling much better. I am well below the minimum age for MAB but my daily inhaled corticosteroid and biologics qualified me.(#4)I think I have it right now, but there are no tests available where I live. I have a fever, headache, body aches, cough and drainage in my throat. I got my monthly xolair shots Wednesday, felt exhausted and sore on Thursday (yay xolair), then got the cough and fever Thursday night. I have a pulse ox, its been 99 when I've checked throughout the day. My husband has been sick since Tuesday. He had a negative test at work Wednesday, but the doctor he saw today said that was too soon to test.

I've had two J&J shots, couldn't get moderna or Pfizer because I'm allergic to an ingredient in them. My kids had the better vaccines, my youngest had an anaphylactic reaction to the second dose, so she can't get a booster.

The cough and drainage are irritating, but not scary at this point. I've got a nebulizer and albuterol and duoneb, I've got prednisone if I need it. I'm taking Sudafed, mucinex and symbicort in addition to my usual zyrtec, singulair, flonase and hydroxyzine. So I think I'll be ok.(#5)If it helps any, this is my last day of isolation after being tested positive for Omicron. I've had mild/bad asthma all my life and my breathing was A-OK and thats without the booster. Absolutely not saying that people aren't affected by this and you should definitely continue to take precautions but it seems people are reporting more cold/flu like symptoms than other strains which is a bit of a silver lining for people like us I suppose.(#6)A family friend who is a really experienced emergency room doctor told my dad that although omicron is more contagious than the other strains, it's often less severe. He's not seeing people come into the emergency room with it, and my city's hospital (can't speak for other areas) isn't over capacity. 

You've got your vaccines. Keep taking your meds. Hang in there! :)(#7)Do you have inhaled steroid maintenance inhaler? If not, it sounds like you need it during your current exacerbation. It also happens that inhaled steroids help prevent serious disease from Covid-19. 

Now let's look at a potential worst case scenario, what happens if you get Covid-19. Since your fully vaccinated and boosted, you can expect it to be as bad as a cold or a flu, your not going to die or get maimed by it.  Nothing to scoff about, but as a mom of a toddler who goes to daycare, we have gotten about 4 non-COVID colds last year. So we're going to treat it as an average exacerbation from a cold. What do you need to get through an exacerbation from a cold? Plenty of rescue inhalers, inhaled steroids + LABA would be best, and having a home nebulizer would be best. You can get home nebulizer from Amazon for $50-100, and it can keep you out of ER (medicine for nebulizer is dirt cheap even in America) so I'd say it's worth having at home (ER is expensive). If it's not helping, you can always go to Urgent care and ask for oral Prednisone. It's not fun, but it works.

Regardless of COVID, you're having an exacerbation, you should talk to your doctor and adjust your asthma management. And your should also talk to your doctor about your worries, and come up with exacerbation plan (if A happens I do B, until C. If that doesn't help I do D, and if that's not enough I go to ER when I feel E.)(#8)Im with you friend . im scared too(#9)Asthma is not considered a risk factor by the CDC last time I checked. Omicron is even more minor than the variants before it. Asthmatics actually have better outcomes than average according to recent data. Probably because the Meds used for asthma help. I wouldn't be worried unless you have other large health concerns(obesity, diabetes, heart disease). Most of those are manageable as well(#10)OP, I‚Äôve been nervous, too. But after reading a lot of these replies, I feel much better. Hope it gives you some peace, too.(#11)Hey!! I just got over omicron. I did have some asthma complications, but here‚Äôs how they went and my recommendations. So, first off, I‚Äôm not boosted. I got symptoms and was contagious for three days before that with my boyfriend who has cancer and his 78-year-old grandpa. They both didn‚Äôt catch it from me, despite the fact we were together for three days and they‚Äôre both more severely at risk and I got symptoms near both of them. After some research I‚Äôve come to the conclusion it‚Äôs probably because they were boosted and I was not. Omicron does not like the booster. So you‚Äôre already ahead of it there!! 

I was sick for three days, the chest cold part of it only lasted about 12 hours for me and didn‚Äôt flare up my asthma at all. I was scared of that the most. Whew! The congestion was the worst part, but nothing to be scared of if you have a nasal flush (NeilMed sinus rinse is the GOAT) and some Tylenol sinus pills or Sudafed. I would recommend to stay away from NyQuil/DayQuil if you do get sick, stick to medicines with expectorants (like Tylenol sinus,) not cough suppressants. Besides that, I had some GI symptoms and extreme fatigue.

After all of my symptoms went away and I was feeling well again, I had some lingering inflammation in my lungs from coughing and general sickness, and ended up having an asthma flare-up. I got some inhalation albuterol for my nebulizer, which is maybe a good idea to have on-hand in your situation if you‚Äôre worried and your doctor agrees that it could be useful. I started to become worried that I was overusing the nebulizer problematically (I had used it three times in one day, when historically my symptoms would clear up after one round,) so I went to the ER. (I don‚Äôt have insurance or a primary care physician, if I did, I might have just made myself an appointment, but I was scared like you are!) The doctors there told me I was not overusing my nebulizer and that I could use it with more regularity for a short amount of time until I cleared up. They were trying to hide the fact that they were wondering why I was there, because I wasn‚Äôt as sick as all of the other people in the ER. It made me feel embarrassed, like I definitely didn‚Äôt need emergency help, but also good that I likely had nothing to worry about. They gave me a chest x-ray and told me that I‚Äôm all clear, just a bit inflamed, which was normal, and sent me home with a round of prednisone. You hypothetically could have some prednisone on-hand ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù But if you feel you need to take it, definitely consult a doctor beforehand, because prednisone does not have a one-size-fits-all prescription. Moral of the story: I hope you stay safe, but if you do get covid just remind yourself of all of the awesome things your body can do to fight illness. There are ways you can prepare yourself and have the upper hand if it does come your way. Best of luck!(#12)I dont know if its possible for you, but you can always just attempt to wait out the surge from home.

This surge may only last another month or so.

Good time to order a book!(#13)Waiting for my test to come back as my girl had it.  Burning sinuses, cough, temp regulation problems but, knock on wood, no extra chest congestion.(#14)My MIL has bad barely controlled asthma and currently has Omicron variant and seems to be doing fine.     


If you want to be prepared make sure you have a blood oxygen monitor also known as a Pulse Oximeter.   They are about 20 dollars, easy to use and will let you know your blood oxygen levels.  The main concern with covid is by the time you notice your breathing difficulties the damage is done when in doubt monitor your blood oxygen levels and ring your  local doctor or teledoc for advice on what to do, if your levels get below 90 and you can't get them back up with meds or deep breathing.   I have found it reassuring to have as everytime I find myself going OMG I'm having trouble breathing it's Covid I do a quick oxygen test and my levels are fine.     Also look into a reliable thermometer if you don't have one That helped me stop that wonderful stress game of I'm too hot or cold OMG it's a fever.(#15)I'm going through it right now. I'm vaccinated with booster and it feels just like I had a small sinus infection, barely even a sickness(#16)I had covid 2 weeks ago and was super anxious it would trigger my asthma . I am double vaxxed with moderna and 43 no booster , I had no sob or asthma flares at all , I took mucinex and used my symbicort regularly and increased my albuterol just when I was coughing a bit 
Lasted about 4/5 days no wheezing at all. Just wanted to share my experience(#17)I‚Äôve had asthma since I was 8. Really bad uncontrolled asthma (like using my rescue inhaler 6-8 times a day, bad). Advair and singular FINALLY helped me control it to where I was never using my rescue inhaler. Due to psychological side effects, I stopped taking singular early 2021. My asthma got a bit worse, even though I was still on advair. 

Fast forward to recently, my asthma has been awful. I‚Äôm now living in an old apartment building with smokers and cats and I always have to use my inhaler upon waking up in the morning (even though I have an air purifier). Thankfully that morning inhaler usually lasts me until the next day. Occasionally if I‚Äôm around extra triggers I‚Äôll have to use my rescue inhaler twice in one day. Anyways, I‚Äôm telling you all this so you can gauge how bad my asthma is. 

I am also on an immunosuppressant injection medication due to another health condition. So I‚Äôm immunosuppressed, I have asthma, AND I‚Äôm unvaccinated. I‚Äôve been terrified of getting Covid because everyone told me it would be a death sentence for me. Well, omicron finally caught me this week. I was sick for one day with a fever and a few days with congestion. By day 4 I felt totally back to normal. And my asthma somehow got better during it???? I‚Äôve not used my rescue inhaler at all this week? I know I‚Äôve gotten very lucky, but maybe my experience can help ease your worries.(#18)I am worried too. A cold/flu is already super bad for my asthma. Have prepared best I can with medication at home and action plan if I do get sick.(#19)Me too. Triple vaxed, ( boosted this week) and I have to take public transit, and work. 

I mask up on transit, anywhere i might be within a few meters of people, even outdoors, work doesn‚Äôt mask but we‚Äôre mostly distanced, half the office is wfh, my job can‚Äôt be made so, and i‚Äôve battled the decision each week as Omicron rises, do i quit my job? Do i risk infection? 

The anxiety is real. Viruses for me are the MAIN trigger of my asthma these days. I am lucky to have abundant rapid tests on hand. ( i test 2-3x a week)(#20)I'm nervous because I had it in the first wave and it is what originally triggered my asthma. I'd rather not go down that road again...(#21)I have it rn. I got quite sick, but just listened to my doctor. Vitamin C and Vit D and lots of water and rest.(#22)Covid is nothing to worry about if you are healthy. Asthma isnt a risk cited by CDC. Do some cardio take your vitamins bro(#23)If the vaccine works like they say it should you have nothing to worry about. I have bad asthma and i was unvaxxed and got it, i was taking a couple breathing treatments a day at home but other than that i was fine. (25M)(#24)I got tested positive Tuesday and I am asthmatic. I only had a very sore throat, coughing, sneezing/leaky nose and congestion. It lasted only 3 days and now I am fine! I didn‚Äôt have any problems with breathing!(#25)It freaks me out too. You're not alone. That being said. I've been sick for over a week. Got a pcr test on Monday,  but I haven't gotten a result yet. 2 rapid tests have been negative. Maybe it's just a bad cold or the flu. No idea.

I had insane nasal congestion, sore throat, aches, fever, headache, and 3 days of extreme fatigue. My asthma is triggered by illness and this definitelytriggered it. I'm on prednisone, nebulizer, and maintenance. It's rough. However, I feel fine outside of that, so it's just a matter of time before I'm fully recovered.

Stay focused on the things you can control: vitamins, maintenance meds, exercise, sleep, masking, and staying home as often as possible. Hang in there.(#26)Maybe this will help, my wife and I (both asthmatics) had Covid back in late October. We are both fully vaccinated. It was like a rough cold. I‚Äôve felt much worse with the seasonal flu. The worst part was the fever. We both did develop moderate coughs, but no shortness of breath.(#27)Hi OP, I have very mild asthma and I‚Äôm on day 8 of covid. The only daily medication i take is Montelukast, and I have my nebulizer/inhaler for flair ups. I also go for allergy shots for the last year, and its really helped. 

Anyway back to covid, first couple of days no effect on my chest. About day 3, my chest started getting tight, and I started using my nebulizer. Day 5 chest was really tight, but lungs were still clear just hard to expand. Day 7, tightness went away chest,rib and back muscles still hurting though and finally started to cough stuff up. I fell better today on day 8, still using nebulizer and dr. gave me a zpack for a probable secondary infection. Still get winded pretty easily but the tightness is gone. 

Tripple vaxed with pfizer(#28)I just tested positive for covid (I'm assuming it's omicron). I'm day 2 and so far it's just like this slow burning in my sinuses. I also think I have an ear infection that started like 2 weeks ago so its been interesting. I've had like a mild fever (99.3), coughing, sneezing, congestion. So far no asthma issues.(#29)I had what was probably delta in March. Suprisingly my breathing was perfectly fine. It was the body aches and headache that sucked. I was taking vitamin d constantly throughout the pandemic, fell off for a couple of months, and then caught it. Still no taste or smell back though. And no omnicron yet, but vitamin d has been consistent."
Spacer fix laryngitis?,2,1.0,16,"(#1)Don't know,  but you'd get more of the medication in your lungs rather than the back of your throat with a spacer.(#2)Symbicort doesn't work properly with a spacer unfortunately. You need to make sure you rinse/gargle water after taking it.(#3)LOTS of water rinsing and drinking. Not just right after, but drink throughout the day a lot as well, it can help. That said, hoarseness is a side effect. I got really bad with the hoarseness at one point and it seems to have mostly gone away.(#4)My daughter uses Symbicort MDI with a spacer. This was confirmed by the respiratory therapist at the hospital. Yes the powder inhaler does not need a spacer. Personally, I really do not like the powder formulas, plus many of them contain milk proteins.(#5)I‚Äôm newer on the scene to using inhalers, but last allergy season I was becoming so hoarse due to my inhaler and got a spacer. I noticed it was helping. It was towards the end of allergy season, and thankfully I don‚Äôt have to use an inhaler year-round as of yet‚Ä¶

The spacer personally cost me about $23 and I suspect it will be a great aid to me in a few months so that I can keep my voice.(#6)Buy the spacer . my allergist suggested it long time ago for me"
relvar ellipta 92/22 air hunger,1,1.0,2,"(#1)You're not meant to use Relvar Ellipta as a rescue/reliever inhaler. It isn't approved for MART regime. Use Ventolin for acute issues, use Relvar as it was prescribed to you."
Asthma gotten worse. Is it even Asthma?,3,0.71,7,"(#1)If albuterol does not work when you have a flare, it's not asthma but if you keep up with the inhaling junk in to your lungs, you will end up with asthma or COPD.(#2)Hi! First of all, I'm so sorry you're going through this. I know exactly what it felt like to be desperate and not feeling like yourself. Second, you were (are, for that matter) very young. Please don't punish yourself for doing something dumb like smoking. That is , unfortunately,the most common age to make those kind of mistakes. IT IS OKAY. I promise. Third, my recommendation is to write down all your questions for the doctor and create an asthma plan. Sounds like you're going through a lot with COVID! Maybe you need steroids. There are times when my nebulizer doesn't feel like it's working and it's because my exacerbation needs steroids to clear all the phlegm. It happens, you'll be okay. Try to get in with a pulmonologist, get properly diagnosed and you'll feel better having more information. Take it one hour a day, then one day at a time... it's going to be okay. This is a great Reddit group. Good luck!(#3)Well, right now you have COVID so that‚Äôs probably the number one problem. It sounds like your lungs have been through a lot, I‚Äôd strongly recommend you look up some respiratory therapy exercises and spend time on your stomach to help with lung function. 

Good news is you‚Äôre young. Your lungs have had a lot thrown at them, but they can heal. There are tons of medicines you haven‚Äôt tried yet and there‚Äôs lots of hope."
Does anyone else get headaches with/after coughing fits?,36,0.97,13,"(#1)It‚Äôs a thing! Primary cough headaches are triggered by intense pressure or straining (coughing vigorously, straining for a bowel movement, laughing, crying‚Ä¶)(#2)Yeah ive had that then it feels like my head throbs(#3)Yeah, definitely, any time I get a bad cough it feels like my brain is getting beat up.  Tylenol seems to help me the most for this.(#4)Yes, I‚Äôve had a coughing fit trigger a migraine &/or brutal headache.  They‚Äôre nasty hon.(#5)Not too often but definitely yes(#6)At my temples. Like a mofo(#7)Having that in particular right now because I have covid :( :((#8)Absolutely. Miserable times, head hurts like hell with every cough and with asthma of course I cough like I‚Äôm dying. I‚Äôll one up you if you don‚Äôt mind. Started having cough syncope. Passing out and waking up confused after violent coughing. 3 days straight. Meds not helping much(#9)Hey im no medical expert but I just heard of a friend who started to have a cough that gave him a headache. He thought that this wasn't normal so he called his doctor, and they immediately sent him to the hospital, where he got diagnosed with pneumonia and got treatment. I'm not saying you, and the other commenters, have pneumonia, but it might be helpful to call a health line to know is this is normal or not. Take care!"
About asthma types and working out,2,0.75,5,"(#1)Advice for working out - i use my rescue inhaler when I have an attack when working out, then I continue as normal. My exercise induced asthma attacks also became less frequent when I consciously trained myself to breathe in a controlled manner through my nose, avoiding heavy breathing through mouth. I find vigorous mouth breathing to be irritating to my lungs.(#2)Hey I gotchu! Use your rescue 15-20 minutes before your workout. Should prevent that. If not, stop when you feel it in your chest and resume when you feel better. It‚Äôs really frustrating when you first start working out to keep stopping and starting, but the longer you do it the less it will happen.(#3)I used to get horrible asthma symptoms whole working out , i believe for me it was allergy related . since being on singulair my symptoms have improved :)(#4)You should be using the foracort on a daily basis, not when you feel attacks. 

If you are just starting working out, you are probably feeling the completely normal ""I'm out of shape"" feeling. It happens to everyone whether they have asthma or not.(#5)Exercise will dramatically improve your asthma. Start with milder workouts and slowly work your way up. Cardio in particular is amazing for your lungs, but again, work your way up, don't overdo it in the beginning."
Doc only prescribes either nebulizer or inhalers?,14,0.94,20,"(#1)Is this a primary care physician or a pulmonologist? I *highly* recommend a pulmonologist. They can give you so much better guidance on how and when and what medications will work for you. 

My PCP told me that if symbicort didn't work for me, I'd have to be on steroids permanently. Went to a pulmonologist (who immediately weaned me off them) and started me on preventative medications that actually worked for me. Now I rarely have to use my inhaler unless I'm ill. When I do get sick, my pulmonologist and I come up with a plan to manage my respiratory health. 

There is absolutely nothing weird about having both an inhaler and nebulizer.  Go see a specialist if you haven't already. They are gems.(#2)so when you see an allergist / asthma specialist they evaluate you and ask have you been to a hospital for an attack and how many times . with me i only had one big bad attack few years ago , and one umm distressing flare up last year . rest of my symptoms in the past were chronic but i believe i was high risk for the hospital . so i had to get many follow up appointments until there was improvement in like i guess its called the peak flow and stuff . so if you had been to the hospital many times and stuff i think thats when they prescribe a nebulizer and stuff(#3)It's often only people who got diagnosed with asthma a while ago when things were different that still have nebulizers at home (or maybe if you have very severe asthma, possibly young children). However the general current wisdom is that a) an inhaler with a spacer can be as effective in most cases that people would use a nebulizer at home b) if your asthma is so bad you do really *need* a nebulizer, you should actually be in the hospital, being appropriately monitored and treated by medical professionals. There are quite a few studies showing people having nebulizers at home is actually a risk - people stay at home self-treating for far longer than they should (and potentially die), instead of seeking appropriate hospital care.

It is now very uncommon in lots of places and moving away from nebulizers in others. So that will be why your doctors are puzzled about it; medical practices have changed.

It's very uncommon here in the UK - you would have to have very severe asthma (and even then I think they're not keen at all for the above reasons).(#4)I actually find it crazy that a lot of people here don‚Äôt get prescribed the meds for Nebulizer. Whenever I ask it‚Äôs always given to me and I usually see urgent care or sometimes my pediatrician. Sometimes the both send a script and I go to the pharmacy and they give me both no issues. I feel like if I didn‚Äôt have the nebulizer I would have been long dead.(#5)My doc won't prescribe me a nebulizer, never really gives any reason why.  Just inhalers. 

But we don't have any trouble getting scrips from our pediatrician for my son, both albuterol and ipratroprium.  We ususally combine the two and use it for him when he's sick.  Works well.  I've used a few for myself every now and then.

Nebulizers are inexpensive and easy to get on Amazon, and prescriptions are generic.  Seems like they should be used more.(#6)The key here is Kaiser‚Ä¶(#7)My regular doctor would just blow me off and fill scripts for inhalers. I decided to get a pulmonologist and it's been a game changer. I have my nebulizer, the vials, Prednisone when I need it .(#8)Actually, I have an allergist that monitors and treats my asthma.  I love the man.  He has helped me so much.  He even prescribed a biologic for my asthma.  This is the first time in forever, I haven't had severe asthma issues since the biologic.  He prescribed it 6 months ago, and I haven't had a major issue with asthma since.  It's life changing, especially in this cold weather we are having lately.(#9)I didn‚Äôt get a nebby till I went to a pulmonary.(#10)I just buy it right from an Indian pharmacy. I'm so sick of these doctors.(#11)When I get to the point I need a nebuliser (which I do about 4-6 times a year), I go to A&E.  I‚Äôve never had a nebuliser at home, other than with paramedics.  When I do need nebulisers it‚Äôs a sign that I also need a course of oral steroids on top of my usual high dose combi inhaler, monteleust tablets and xolair injections.  Usually salbutamol taken with a spacer far more preferable than a neb, and even when I do need a neb, 2- 4 puffs of salbutamol with a spacer repeated every 5 mins or so will cover me long enough to get to A&E or for an ambulance to arrive, and I usually don‚Äôt even consider a neb till I‚Äôm 10 puffs down and still rebounding.  I‚Äôm in the UK, and home nebulisers are really uncommon, even with quite severe asthma."
Asthma in the winter,15,0.94,17,"(#1)Winter is generally worse for me as well. I don't think you can become dependent on preventative inhalers, but it's really a discussion to be had with your doctor because it really shouldn't be a seasonal medication I don't think. Do you have an albuterol inhaler? How often do you need to use it?(#2)My asthma gets much worse with temperature extremes, either hot or cold. (My utility bills reflect that, unfortunately) 
I chuckle when the utility company wants to install smart thermostats in my house‚Ä¶ how about no? They can control those remotely during high demand times, and they don‚Äôt care if you have health issues that require it set to a certain temperature!
Edit: I don‚Äôt understand why people are so freaked out about using their controller inhaler when it‚Äôs prescribed. The purpose of the controller is to avoid the FAR WORSE problem of needing oral steroids, which you do not want! Oral steroids have nasty side effects. Inhaled steroids do not. Please use your prescribed daily controller inhaler. It isn‚Äôt addictive like opiates, but it saves you far greater headaches.(#3)yup, winter and seasonal allergies(#4)I have asthma year round and I use my preventative inhaler year round as well. BUT my asthma is DEFINITELY affected by extremely cold air. I've found that wearing a mask or scarf of some sort that covers my mouth and nose actually helps a lot and makes the air I breathe in less ""sharp"". Having to wear a mask everywhere for covid regulations anyways has been a blessing in disguise in the winter! Also less runny nose from the cold when wearing a mask in this weather!

TL;DR try wearing a face covering when you have to spend some time out in the cold weather if you're so inclined.(#5)I do a few things for my asthma in the winter because mine is exercise induced, winter, and allergies (SUCKS!). But I try to really keep my face covered when I‚Äôm outside so I‚Äôm not breathing in too much cold air. I do take my albuterol inhaler, but at max 2x a week. But I‚Äôm trying to limit my usage of it. I used to have a humidifier but I need a new one (but that helps at night) and I do take Robutussin here and there and cough drops. Because for me it‚Äôs really a tickle and covering my nose and mouth when I‚Äôm outside. The air is super dry so I definitely try to limit being outside too much and to keep the air inside not so dry. 

It‚Äôs a lot of trying things out, for me at least, but I hope you find something that works for you.(#6)If your preventer is an inhaled steroid then you cannot become dependant on it, you can  decrease the effectiveness on your rescue inhaler (albuterol etc) if you overuse it (and this is massively overuse in a everyday for ages way it not just an extra puff now and then) .  So it is better to use your preventer every day than to not use it and need to use your rescue inhaler.    You do not become dependent on an either  inhaler if used as directed.    It is not weakness on your part to need to use the preventer, asthma is a disease, will power won't ""fix"" it so please use it and be comfortable.(#7)My asthmas been okay in the winter . summer with me is horrible . however i do experience allergy symptoms that sometimes aggravate it but nothing severe(#8)My asthma stays year round. Wear a scarf when you go outside to prewarm the air.(#9)Sudden temperature changes are something my lungs don't like at all. I honestly like wearing a mask outside at the moment because it makes the air not as cold when breathing in. I tend to keep my mouth covered when going outside while at the same time (and after spending some time outside) my mind and sinuses love the fresh, cold air. 

Inside I am using a humidifier and find it to be really helpful. Hot, steam showers are also nice after spending time outside. 

I think you should talk to your doctor about using your inhaler daily. This is what its for and if it helps I think you should definitely use it.(#10)Winter is definitely worse, especially when exercising outdoors.(#11)Out of interest have you recently had the Pfizer booster vaccine? Please note I am NOT an anti vaxxer but I‚Äôve experienced the same. No asthma at all since 35 - I‚Äôm now 58 - but since having the Pfizer booster my asthma is horrible with a horrible tickly cough & phlegm. It‚Äôs been 5 weeks now. 
I wouldn‚Äôt have connected the two & TBH am not convinced, but I‚Äôve heard of 3 people with similar experiences & a good number with just the tickly cough. 
I‚Äôd really welcome yours / anyone else‚Äôs insight here. 
Good luck resolving your asthma issues - it‚Äôs not nice but hope the flare up subsides soon.(#12)Try Sea moss gel herbal teas like mullein leaf, exercise eat more greens and vegetables for your lungs, alkaline  foods are good dr.sebi, steam I hate winters growing worst time had to stack up on pumps, couldn't sleep when I had enough made all the changes did breathing exercises along with Yoga for long term benefits today I don't fear winter."

Omicron in asthma patients,3,0.72,20,"(#1)Sounds like allergies as there is clear exposure to your triggers there. The only way you'll know whether it is COVID or not is if you get a test. If you're unwilling to get a test then isolate as per your country's rules. Otherwise you're potentially exposing people. If you don't want to isolate then you should get a test. Sanitize your hands on the way in and way out, practice social distancing and wear a mask. You'll be fine. I had to get two tests in December, the test centers were fine.(#2)Get tested. My BIL caught COVID outdoors (unmasked) with vaccinated friends. He doesn‚Äôt have asthma, but his symptoms were similar. Everyone in the group was double vaxxed, most were just a few days out from their booster, the one person in the group to not get it was a couple months after their booster.(#3)Man, your allergy flair ups sounds just like mine. I hope you feel better. 

I had asthma and allergies. Caught Covid last Monday and I‚Äôm pretty much all better. I had absolutely no sinus issues or cough, which was super awesome because I deal with that enough. I take lots of vitamins for my allergies and netty pot every other day, so maybe that had something to do with that? 

I tested for Covid because I had a 103 fever and crazy body aches. Symptoms after that were headache and nausea.(#4)My exact symptoms! Finally over it!! Lasted 16 days(#5)This just sounds like cold to me‚Ä¶"

Quitting caffeine and asthma,1,0.67,12,"(#1)On respiratory floors in the hospital, the first thing patients hit in the morning is the coffee pot. Several cups.
Then breathing treatments begin. Why do you think this would be?
Caffeine is a bronchodilator.
Look it up.(#2)I went the other way - I've hard asthma my whole life and just started drinking coffee a year ago. I've definitely noticed that I feel like I can breathe better on the days I drink it, and that my morning symptoms recede faster on the days I drink it.

If you can have some caffeine, you can try tea (black tea has \~40% the caffeine as a similar sized cup of coffee, green tea \~20%, white tea \~10%) or decaf coffee (I don't remember how much caffeine is in decaf, but it's not quite 0%), or if you can't have any caffeine, you could try hot chocolate or herbal tea (which has no actual tea in it, and so no caffeine). The warmth of the drink can still help reduce symptoms, even without the caffeine, and something like chamomile can help you feel less stressed as well.(#3)Caffeine contributes to my asthma, so I limit myself. Everyone is different. I‚Äôve heard others say that caffeine helps them. I wish that were my case. I drink half-caff espresso drinks (one or two a day). If I forget to order half-caff, I pay the price by immediately coughing and eventually having an asthma attack.(#4)Coffee gives me energy which makes me breathe better. But I had to reduce it as I was getting adrenaline rush from Flovent and the extra energy from coffee was too much to handle. I drink hot tea (caffeine free) if I wasn‚Äôt drinking coffee. Hot drink definitely helps my symptoms(#5)Two words my mate . Withdrawals and anxiety"
"Asthma symptoms are worse in the Winter for the past 2 years, and I don‚Äôt know why.",20,0.92,23,"(#1)I‚Äôd recommend trying a humidifier. I‚Äôm not sure that this is the case for all asthmatics, but for me the dry cold air is a trigger so I use a humidifier at night.(#2)Warm dry air is best for asthma. Cold weather makes it worse for a lot of people.(#3)Ugh, my sympathies, I've been there. It sounds like you've got an environmental problem, have you had your heating system cleaned, or considered replacing flooring? My mom & both have asthma and had annual winter flare-ups (and inevitable pneumonia) for years. Hers improved dramatically when she ripped out all her old carpeting and replaced it with mostly hard floors (and just a little bit of new carpet in the bedroom). 

My winter symptoms stopped entirely when I relocated to a subtropical climate. Obviously these are fairly drastic measures, and for some people hot & humid makes things worse,  but if you're suffering like clockwork in winter, something about your environment in winter is probably to blame.(#4)I'm in Ohio, and my asthma flares up in the winter also. I don't know if it is simply because of the colder, dryer air, or if it is also from being inside more with the furnace running.(#5)I don‚Äôt know much about the climate where you live, but here in Northern California winter is rainy season and my asthma and allergies always get worse the day or two after it rains‚Äî I think it‚Äôs a mold allergy and the rain is causing mold to grow outdoors. Then the super dry indoor air (from running the heater) makes things worse. It does help to sleep with a humidifier on, since that makes the air indoors less dry.(#6)It sounds like you think you are sick with an infectious disease all winter. That is unlikely.

Common triggers of winter asthma include cold worse, local pollution from wood-burning stoves and wildfires, local pollution due to weather inversions, uncleaned air ducts, and other dust and allergen in the home (as more time is spend indoors).

Consider getting an HEPA filter for some rooms of the house, cleaning the air ducts (done by a professional), getting an regular cleaning schedule (with a HEPA vacuum filter) and if applicable wet cleaning any carpets with an anti-dust or anti-allergen treatment.

Also if I recall advair has a relatively low dose of steriods. You might need something stronger for the winter for your controller.

If the cause of your misery if genuinely getting disease after disease, there is little your doctor get do. The only solution would be a significant lifestyle change to limit your exposure.(#7)A few years ago I just accepted the fact that my body and mind couldn't do winters and moved to a warmer climate. Have had maybe one or two colds since I moved 5 years ago and my asthma has been well under control. One year up north I went to the hospital 7 times in one winter for asthma attacks. Thats when I made up my mind to not ever do that again

I know its not a great thing to hear but it really worked and its not too uncommon for asthmatics to move to find a climate that works for them.(#8)I looked up the average monthly temps and humidity for northern AL, and I think it's unlikely to be cold air or low humidity. The fact that you're continuing to have symptoms when inside suggests this is also the case. I didn't check the wind speed but since you said it was the past couple years, if your area is like mine, our winter winds have picked up a bunch and have caused me to have worse symptoms. If you think that might be the case, I would suggest tracking your symptoms compared to temp/humidity/wind and see if there's a correlation. You can get humidifiers that have a display for the humidity, so you can track inside your house as well.

There's also a possibility, since you do experience mild winters, that it's a plant allergen that has recently moved into the area or you've gotten more sensitive to. When I lived in CO, my apartment wasn't well-sealed, and I had some weird seasonal allergies that I didn't have back home which would knock me out hard, even indoors. They were worse each year, and I never found out what it was. It could be that, esp if your area is seeing an increase in wind like mine is, that those allergens are getting kicked around more than in the past, even in winter.(#9)Just am alternate idea. Have you looked into gerd? I started getting ‚Äúworse asthma symptoms‚Äù in my late 20s and now I‚Äôve finally made the connection (late 30s) that it could be reflux. 

Still need to go to the doc to check it out. But there is definitely a connection with asthma and some things that I eat(#10)Same!(#11)Move???"
Am I wrong or is my allergist wrong‚Ä¶ I said I want to go on a nebilizer(mask) for my asthma instead of symbicort and they said it was not a daily long term treatment but a fast acting treatment like Albuterol. Am I dumb or did the times chnage I always though a nebilizer was similar to symbicort,3,0.64,35,"(#1)Symbicort, according to my google search, ""is a long acting bronchodilator used to prevent bronchospasm in people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."" A nebulizer is a type of medical equipment that you put your medication in so you can quickly inhale it. I have only used a nebulizer in the ER when I was unable to stop coughing and when I very sick at home as a child; I have never heard of taking medication via a nebulizer as a long term daily treatment.(#2)A nebulizer is simply a delivery method for medicine. You can put varying types of medicines in it.  The nebulizer turns the medicine into an aerosol of optimal particle size for inhalation.

 For adults, typically the type of medicine put in the nebulizer is a short acting bronchodilator like albuterol. Because children are often not as coordinated as adults at using an inhaler and making sure the medicine gets deep in their lungs, some pediatric patients use a nebulizer to also deliver long acting or preventive meds. So you may very well be remembering correctly that as a child you used it every day to take your preventive medicine. Today's dry powder inhalers (Symbicort for ex) are a little easier to use and just as effective for most patients. If Symbicort is not working well for you there are many more asthma medications that can be tried that would not require a nebulizer.(#3)Symbicort will reduce the frequency of asthma symptoms so you need abulterol or any other short-term treatment far less often.(#4)My pulmonary doctor put me on budesonide daily in my neb instead of symbicort. It was much cheaper with my insurance instead of the inhaler. It works perfectly fine for me for maintenance with my asthma and I have eosinophilic asthma.(#5)So my severe asthma causes me to be on multiple drugs, including Brovana, which is for COPD and is a nebulizer medication. It is similar to symbicort, I found that symbicort makes my heart race like crazy. I would look into seeing a pulmonary. They are more prepared to handle unusual requests and use medications for off label uses.(#6)It depends on the med! They‚Äôre less common for adults now but yeah some people do take controller meds via neb. I only use mine for bad attacks and when I have respiratory infections, but some people do use it for what you‚Äôre thinking of. Like other people said, it‚Äôs a delivery method so it‚Äôll depend on what vial you put in it. 

This isn‚Äôt a neb medicine, but if you haven‚Äôt given Spiriva a shot highly recommend. It‚Äôs a wet inhaler so like a mist you inhale. You take it along with something like symbicort and it helped me a lot(#7)A nebulizer is how the medication is delivered. I also had one as a kid, back in the day the idea was they worked better than standard inhalers. Later scientific research didn‚Äôt back that up so most of the time inhalers are great. Any medication can be nebulized. Everything from albuterol to inhaled antibiotics. Symbicort is two maintenance medications intended for daily use. It would help raise your baseline level of health. 

I second seeing a pulmonologist who can help with your allergist recommendations. Are your main triggers for asthma allergies induced?(#8)Symbiocort wasn't a good fit for me. 

I switched to Qvar for a minute which was better, but my pulm just put me on Revlar which has been incredible. Haven't touched my rescue inhaler since I started it.(#9)Have you tried using a spacer with your symbicort? I was having the same issue with not feeling like I got it in my lungs. Doc gave me a spacer and it feels better.(#10)a nebulizer is like a treatment for flare up isnt it ? symbicort is for long term . i would stick with the symbicort . lol dont do what i did , i got a surprise mild attack last year !! it was not fun . of corse stick to the asthma treatments as needed but dont go off symbicort lmao(#11)Young children can use the nebulizer with budesonide as an everyday treatment. The budesonide is a corticosteroid. Albuterol is a bronchodilator that is used as a rescue drug. 
Asthma Docs have young kids use the nebulizer everyday because it is hard to teach inhaler use. If an adult really wants to do the nebulizer instead of the inhaler‚Ä¶it is possible, just takes time and a large amount of medication.(#12)I use a nebulizer at home when I have an exacerbation of asthma. When I'm really sick.(#13)You are wrong. If you are using a neb or rescue inhaler more than 2-3 times a week your asthma is not in control and you need a controller med such as Symbicort."
Nebulizer 25mg Albuterol in a humidifier,6,0.88,8,"(#1)This does not answer your question, but I have a bit of advice. I also suffer from night time anxiety, sometimes due to nightmares other times I don‚Äôt know what causes it. I wake up regularly with an inability to breathe and feeling like I need my rescue. One thing that has helped me so much is to just get up and sit outside for a minute (especially if it‚Äôs cold) and just take deep breathes for a couple minutes. Even if it‚Äôs hard. Remind yourself you can breathe and you are alive. By the time you have calmed down past that sudden need, you will probably still need your inhaler but maybe not like you did before.

Edit; I also suggest not leaving the inHaler right beside your bed. If someone has a serious objection to this I will understand. But I really think it‚Äôs so easy to just grab it first thing and not do anything else to heal from the cause. When it‚Äôs in another room or down stairs or something you have to actually separate yourself from the situation.(#2)No, you cannot do this. I strongly recommend seeing a therapist. There are medications that can help you deal with night terrors.

Using a stimulant (albuterol) is only going to make your night terrors worse.(#3)Keep some water by ur bed! I find that drinking water at night helps with my breathing during times like that. Inhalers should really only be used in times of absolutely emergencies"
Do any of you get mad at people for smoking?,71,0.94,42,"(#1)I'm glad this isn't just me. I'm not proud of it and I try not to be judgmental, but it's frustrating.(#2)""Why y'all throwing away perfectly good lungs like that?!""(#3)I only get mad when it impacts my life. 

Like you are smoking around me or I have co-workers who like to think they get extra break time to feed their addiction. 

I'm never jealous of someone who's likely going to die a very slow and miserable death in the future because they want to maintain the habit. I pity people who don't have the strength to overcome an addiction for not only themselves but for their families. That's sad to have nothing that important in your life that a habit is #1.(#4)Sometimes I feel bad for them. They‚Äôre out there ruining a perfectly healthy pair of lungs.(#5)I dont care what they do to themselves but I do when they choose to smoke around me. I remember being on a ventilator in a medically induced coma for 10 days due to my severe asthma. I was at my home recovering and family memers from out of state came to visit. One had the AUDACITY to come into the home smoking a cigar üôÑ I told him to not smoke inside and he ended up going outside. They can do what they want just dont inconvience others. There are designated smoking areas for a reason. The ones that disregards those things is what irritates me.(#6)I smoke . ive had bad asthma as a kid as well . with this pandemic i feel so hopeless and upset i do smoke as well . im like if i get covid my asthma will most likely become severe . i feel .. doomed . im just like smoke anyway(#7)I have asthma as well and have also even been a smoker on occasion. I think it has little to do with intentionally taking ""healthy"" lungs for granted and more about the feeling that smoking gives/how addictive smoking can be. Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances available. I do totally get where you're coming from though! I've been on both sides of the fence. I wish you a healthy life ‚ù§Ô∏è(#8)Just walk away.(#9)I feel similarly, but only when people do it in non-designated areas/away from buildings. In the case of cigarettes, I very much get that it‚Äôs an addiction, so I don‚Äôt get mad if it‚Äôs done ‚Äòrespectfully.‚Äô I can‚Äôt control every trigger, so I try to approach smokers kindly. 

I had a neighbor who used to smoke on her back porch, which was right next to our windows (we only had windows on one side bc it was a duplex of townhomes). I asked her very nicely if she‚Äôd smoke on the street, and I mentioned my asthma as the reason, and she didn‚Äôt do it. Got pissed at me, actually. Said she also had asthma, and I just needed to deal with my triggers and not infringe on her freedoms. It turned into a messy situation. It was one of the strangest responses‚Ä¶most people I‚Äôve met seem to be very understanding. It‚Äôs rare that people take the request as some kind of attack on them(?).(#10)As someone with asthma who vapes (I had asthma first then picked up vaping), I can say it pisses me off to hear about people who don‚Äôt respect other people‚Äôs wishes. You have every right to be annoyed by those of us who do smoke and vape, especially if it triggers your asthma, and you also have every right to ask them to not smoke or vape around you. Besides, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs that hard for a smoker/vaper to move to another room or just go outside/leave the area.

Bad on them for not listening to your requests, they deserve a kick to the nethers.(#11)I have pretty bad asthma and I smoke and vape heavily. It will kill me one day but hey at least I'm not smoking crack anymore(#12)Smoking never bothers me much because I usually encounter it outdoors in locations that I can move around or there's good air flow. 

Don't get me started on perfume and cologne though. I paid money for these theater seats and I can't sit in them because you had to make sure the WHOLE THEATER COULD SMELL YOU? I'm stuck at work and you're a customer and it's my job to talk to you but I CAN'T CATCH MY BREATH BECAUSE YOU REEK. I'm sure I would feel the same about smokers if I had lived when smoking indoors was normalized.(#13)My only problem really is people who walk and smoke. If I'm stuck walking behind someone smoking and I'm forced to have to hold back or overtake it does annoy me a lot. It seems petty putting it in words but genuinely feels very ignorant in the moment!(#14)Only if they are inconsiderate and smoke around me.

But my wife smokes (didn't plan that but hard to choose who you love) but she is a very neat and considerate smoker so it seldom affects me and if I'm getting whiffs of it, I let her know and she moves.

Smoking is mostly banished to the great outdoors and the shadows these days so it doesn't come up much.(#15)I don‚Äôt get mad at smokers and would never tell someone ‚Äúnot to smoke around me‚Äù because I have asthma. We have to live with what we have and work around it, people don‚Äôt need to work around us.

With that said, yes. I‚Äôm super jealous of the 60 year old man chain smoking that could out run me with ease. People who smoke don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to suffocate all day long without having ever picked up a cig or vape.(#16)I smoked for 10 year. I quit 8 years ago. I get super pissed at smokers. Fucking disgusting shits.(#17)You can't focus on what others do, but what you do.

After all, if you focused on others flaws, you would just be frustrated all day. There are a ton of people that would ease their asthma if they lost weight, and they refuse the idea!(#18)If it's at a restaurant outside I try to choose a seat away from smokers. If some start smoking beside me I try not to judge, but will cough and use my inhaler in front of them. 99% notice and finish quickly/move their cigarette away from me. If its vapers or cigars (those trigger me the most) I ask for a table change for myself, the waiters have always worked out a solution so far (moving my group, asking the smokers to stop if full...).(#19)I have had severe asthma my whole life. As a baby I lived in the ICU, as an adult I still need to control with a steroid inhaler and always have a nebulizar on deck to avoid the ER. Funny thing is- I smoked cigarettes for over ten years and it never really effected my asthma (other than the secondary effects of an immune system compromised by cigs). I vaped nicotine for awhile, which actually bothered me more than cigarettes so I quit completely. But being around nic vape never ever set off asthma symptoms bc it is vapor, it just annoyed me bc of the smell. But I‚Äôve found vaping marijuana to actually be beneficial to the the asthma I get during allergy season. 

I think a lot of us asthmatics are told we can‚Äôt experience any of these things when the reality is that we can and sometimes they might even help us.(#20)Shooting smokers should be legal if they refuse to stop or leave.(#21)I do. Especially at my dad who used to carry me around and smoke at the same time. The 80s were a free for all.(#22)I get pissed at smokers and wish emphysema on them when they light up outside the door of a building, instead of going to the smoking area, not gonna lie.(#23)I've always had a mild annoyance, but never getting outright mad at the fact. I know a lot of people, a good chunk of which I'm quite close to who smoke to some extent and most of the time, they make sure to open a window or something, even if I'm not there. Smoke really unsettles my lungs though, leaves me coughing for a good while afterwards and by extent, often makes me feel a wee bit unwell.(#24)I don't get triggered by it and I oddly enough like the smell(#25)No. Minding my own business leads to a much more stress free life. Stead is bad for asthma.(#26)No, vaping doesn't bother me at all, and I don't spend any time indoors with smokers. I had family members that used to smoke and that did bother me, but it's an addiction, a disease. I watched them struggle to quit so many times. Then they were able to switch to vaping, and now it doesn't bother me or my asthma."
Have you tried Ginkgo Biloba for asthma?,3,0.8,2,"(#1)I haven't, but ginkgo has been used for thousand of years, so it's probably safe to assume it isn't going to kill you. Do some research, and give it ago. Just because the FDA doesn't regulate something doesn't mean it has no use.(#2)Herbal supplements aren't regulated at all by the FDA, so you have no idea how much or how little you're getting. Your best bet is to just use actual prescription asthma meds to manage your asthma."
Tightness at base of throat/SOB when exercising in combo with asthma and hyperventilation syndrome?,1,1.0,6,"(#1)Could be EIA, could be something else. Why not try using your rescue inhaler 10-15min before exercise? This is standard practice for people with EIA and if it helps in your case it would be indicative of EIA. 
You should talk to your Pulmonologist about this though.(#2)If peak flow is lower and u feel out of breath could be a mix of some exercise induced asthma and being out of shape. Try taking you reliever a bit before working out"

Quitting Smoking,5,0.78,14,"(#1)Hey same man . i had bad asthma as a kid as i got older it got a bit better but last few years its gotton worse again and then im like hey ima start smoking üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ well for one heres a tip , dont listen to the fucking karens on here(#2)Cold turkey is the way to go!!!(#3)Nicorette gums. A life saver. And stop everything you associate with smoking for a while - coffee, alcohol, bars, whatever it is, stop doing it.(#4)For me gum helped a lot. Same thing when you sit and watch TV. Your mind is conditioned to be eating a snack, I found once I removed my nicotine dependence by vaping lower and lower nicotine levels that gum helped the I need a CIG in my mouth sensation. I eventually got to 0% and at that point it was just for the act. Gum helped me drop vaping and removed the oral part of the habit. Also you might get moody or eat more and that's OK. Add exercise and take hot showers to clear your lungs out. You will see so nasty shit over the next couple weeks but trust me stick to it. You'll feel worlds better. Nicotine addiction is horrible.(#5)just take it one day at a time. ‚Äúi only have to get through today‚Äù. do not listen to yourself make excuses like ‚Äúwell maybe ill just have one now to help ween myself off‚Äù NO. no excuses. 

also, find someone (a friend, family member or an online forum) that you can keep updated on your quitting journey. every night tell them that you didnt smoke a single cig all day. or even just keep a tally in a journal. that helps keep you accountable and you wont want to ruin your progress!(#6)Yo, I feel this. Like some others, smoking hasn't really bothered me at all unless it's a bad pull, hence I quit vaping. I started smoking when I was 16, between friends dying left and right, and my dad almost dying a few times. The only method I've found to quit is just be sick. It might not be permanent, but it lets me detox a bit. Or either run out or lock away my solution. Give myself a harder time to breathe for a period will prevent me from smoking so I don't make it worse. Whether or not this helps is up to you(#7)Add Herbal tea like Mullein leaf, more greens and vegetables for lungs to be stronger, try Sea moss works for me since I smoke a lot and weed, also alkaline foods are good dr.sebi, steam is good 2 and exercising, you feel a big difference(#8)Ex smoker here. It‚Äôs easy not to take the long term effects seriously but as an asthmatic, smoking is SO much worse for you. You‚Äôll have a much higher chance  of getting COPD than a non-asthmatic smoker. You‚Äôre potentially shaving years off of your life and if not, giving yourself a shittier go of it than if you stop now and be kind to yourself and your body. If you won‚Äôt do it for yourself, do it for your body! It‚Äôs had to fight an uphill battle since you were 4. I don‚Äôt know if you do any kind of waking or hiking but for me, I noticed how much better my lungs performed while hiking after I stopped smoking cigarettes. 

Be good to your body and kind to yourself. Life can be beautiful and you deserve a chance at the longest happiest life your asthmatic body can give you. But you gotta help it"
Methacholine Challenge,2,0.75,7,"(#1)I had it before I went on controller meds, and while the experience was fine (I didn‚Äôt react as bad as I normally do, but bad enough to meet the diagnostics and need lots of ventolin to be brought back to baseline), I did have a bad cough and lots of inflammation for a few weeks after. But I was already in a bad inflammatory response to begin with. 

Glad I got it done though, because I can be completely great one time (above average in all measurements) and then a flare up would hit and I‚Äôd be debilitated. My lovely GP was convinced it was anxiety or something. Glad we cleared that up once and for all and I could get proper treatment.(#2)I've done it (turns out I have reactive airway and not asthma). I came out sounding like I smoked 50 packs of cigarettes in there and it was a bit startling to go from breathing fine to instantly feeling like my airway is closing up on me but I honestly didn't expect to have any type of reaction so I wasn't prepared for one.(#3)I‚Äôve had the test now, and thought I‚Äôd share my experience in case someone is looking for the same answers as I was prior to the test. 

I‚Äôve had asthma since I was a child, and was already on controller meds. I did the test because all my recent PFTs have been good. I was a bit nervous that I wouldn‚Äôt react and that they would take away my meds. 

On the day of the test I had been slightly symptomatic beforehand, but my baseline spirometry was good. After the baseline spirometry, I inhaled saline to practice, and then we started the test. On the first dose I felt nothing. After the 2nd dose I felt slightly tight. After the 3rd dose I felt very tight and could not complete a sentence. I was borderline after the 3rd dose, so I had to do a 4th. After the 4th dose I felt the same as after the 3rd, but I apparently dropped by a lot. I was really phlegmy, coughing and wheezing. I‚Äôve never felt that tight before. Then they gave me ventoline, and I went above baseline after, although I still had a lot of phlegm. There was no doubt I had asthma. The symptoms I got during the test were the same as I normally get during an exacerbation, except for the tightness, which was a lot worse. 

I was really nervous before the test, mostly because I was afraid they were going to take my meds away. Now that I‚Äôve done the test, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve had it, so no one can question my diagnosis. They upped my daily controllers, so hopefully my asthma will be controlled again soon, after months of being uncontrolled."
Does anyone with adult onset asthma have lung irritation pretty much 24/7 that doesn‚Äôt fluctuate a lot?,20,0.92,18,"(#1)Me(#2)Yup!

But if I miss more than one day I‚Äôm the burning pain is back. Not sure I‚Äôll ever be able to get off it.(#11)Asthma is only constant when it is not properly controlled by a preventative medication.  

Personally I can't vape, I have serious sinus issues and it burns my sinuses and I end up having sinus infection from the irritation. yes we can develop inflammation of the throat and lining of our airways from vaping.

 There is not much research but what they are finding out is the heat and chemical exposure may end up changing the tissue structure over time(creating melanoma type cells) but literally  we don't have any research on this because vaping has way too many big corporations funding this trend. 

Lately if I dab, even with my preventative on point and rescue taken ahead of time. My lungs feel that sticky heat and they can't handle it. It's either smoked out of glass,  an edible or homemade budder for me. Good luck, listen to your body,  the mind will try to ignore."

Long asthma exacerbation,8,0.99,11,"(#1)Not a doctor, just been asthmatic for a very long time.

Have you ever overdone things at the gym and woken up a day or two later in serious pain?

You have muscles in your rib cage. Usually you don‚Äôt use them when you breathe because your diaphragm does most of the work, but when you have a bad asthma incident, they pitch in to help you get more air moving ‚Ä¶ and then they hurt, because you just asked them to do a lot of work that they don‚Äôt usually do. Heat helps me.

And sometimes you don‚Äôt move a lot because you can‚Äôt breathe lying still, much less moving around, and the hospital fucks up your blood thinners, and you‚Äôre a mutant who‚Äôs prone to blood clotting anyway, and you end up with blood clots all over your lungs. Ask me how I know!(#2)NAD, obvi, but when this has happened to me, I think of what someone else said: your intercostal muscles are working on overdrive! I‚Äôm not sure if this will help you, but I‚Äôve had luck with looking up YT vids of respiratory therapists who help their patients learn how to breathe better/more deeply after acute asthma attacks, bronchitis, Covid, etc. It might not work, but maybe worth a try?(#3)Yep! I get super bad back/chest pain during/after a flare up. I have a prescription for muscle relaxers that help a lot. Without the muscle relaxers it normally takes a few weeks for me to get back to normal.(#4)Yep . man , i know the feeling . i have had one last year , wasnt severe but it was worse than normal . the breathless symptoms sucked . i couldnt do normal activities as usual or it would trigger almost hyperventilating(#5)were you tested for covid?"
New Pulm Today,3,1.0,0,

I just saw my primary care when my asthma first popped back up 4 years ago, but it kept getting worse and 1 year ago I finally saw a specialist who realized my asthma was more advanced and that i needed more than just a rescue inhaler. I wish I had been getting this treated years ago before it got to this point.(#3)I did this and was diagnosed with asthma ‚Ä¶ it sucks!

"Need some help, advice, and support for a newly diagnosed asthmatic.",3,1.0,9,"(#1)My peak flow meter doesn‚Äôt come any good, I can feel horrible with no change. Some people find an oxygen meter helps more. The one reliable external measurement is when my heart rate is high, that triggers my exercise asthma. But that doesn‚Äôt answer any of the other times I think about using it. 

What I did when I first started was that if I had symptoms, like any at all, I‚Äôd use my inhaler and see how that affects how I felt. 

Go to the hospital if any of the following are true: 

* you are coughing until you vomit, and either can‚Äôt use the inhaler, or doing so doesn‚Äôt help

* your lips or skin are turning blue

* you can‚Äôt get enough air in, and either can‚Äôt use the inhaler, or doing so doesn‚Äôt help

Talk to your doctor if you‚Äôre using your inhaler 4 times a day or more (that is, 2 puffs each = 8 puffs a day), or if using the inhaler isn‚Äôt helping your symptoms. You may need a controller medication.(#2)Please don't wait until your lips and skin go blue before seeking help with an asthma attack. That's a dangerously low bar.

Generally if you are having an asthma attack, if your inhaler is not working - you are not getting better or you are getting worse - you need to seek help. Here the advice is one puff of your reliever inhaler every 30-60 seconds up to 10 puffs, then it's ambulance time. Not being able to use your inhaler is also obviously a reason to seek help -  but it's notoriously difficult to use inhalers correctly when having an attack, and I would highly recommend getting a spacer. It may avoid trips to hospital - for example, I often can't breathe in enough to use my inhaler when having sudden attacks, it used to take me 8-9 puffs of my inhaler to get it to stop just because I was only getting a tiny bit of medication into my lungs with each puff. They felt like really bad scary attacks. Then I got a spacer, and use 'tidal breathing' (i.e. you breathe in and out rather than having to take one deep breath in) and now the average I need with the same sorts of attacks is about 3 puffs.

I would say use your inhaler when you feel bad, don't try to second guess whether you 'really need it'. If you feel tight chested, wheezy, coughing, breathless - you need it. You are always better using your inhaler at the first sign of symptoms, than leaving it to get worse. Peak flow gives you a good general idea, but as someone else has already pointed out, it's not a strict correlation for lots of people - some people don't feel bad until their peak flow has dropped a lot, other people feel bad even though their peak flow hasn't dropped much. You kind of just have to get used to how it goes for you.(#3)Following! I recently started using peak flow meter as well(#4)Your doctor needs to write an action plan out for you with numbers and what to do if you get to a certain point.(#5)Request an appointment with a pulmonologist. They can help educate you as to what is normal for  you."
Quitting smoking and asthma,2,0.75,8,"(#1)I just quit 5 days ago and my breathing has improved tremendously! I didn't realize how much I was being affected.  Happy I quit, hopefully I can stick to it.  I wish you luck!(#2)Im scared of smokers flu lmao im scared of a flare up"

Covid positive,73,0.98,24,"(#1)OHMYGOD 
I‚Äôve been wanting to ask someone this. You use the exact combination of medications that I do. 
This is really helpful. Thank you.(#2)Trelegy user checking with a positive test and on round two of Prednisone to calm down inflamed lungs. üò¨

But I qualified for antibodies and it helped!(#3)Lifelong asthmatic on Advair and albuterol. I‚Äôve now had COVID-19 twice - Delta early last year. Got vaccinated with Pfizer, then booster in October. And now got Omicron last week. 

First time through was tough, but it never really got my lungs. Watched PO, used the hell out of a nebulizer. even hacked my CPAP machine when I dropped below 90% to force air into my lungs. I was this close to hacking an oxygen supplement (hospitals were at 100% back then). The CPAP saved me from developing pneumonia. And after three weeks of hell, I recovered.

Second time I just felt very sick for a couple of weeks, lungs were fine.

YMMV. Take care of yourself. Keep your lungs clear, watch your PO.(#4)Thanks for the great news.. I'm just getting over the flu and it kicked my asthma big time.. I'm nervous with the covid spike but this makes it not as terrifying(#5)Ugh, so sorry you caught it. I'm feeling poorly after a kiddo brought something gross home from his dad's house. Rapid tests say I'm negative, but I haven't been this sick in quite some time. Massive sinus congestion, mild fever, slight on/off cough, and my chest hurts almost like heartburn. However, I'm breathing OK and the oximeter has good numbers. I went for a PCR test yesterday as well and we'll see how that goes.

What type of discomfort are you feeling?(#6)I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre sick, and thank you for sharing. You and I have the same vaccines and medications, and this gives me a little peace of mind. The anxiety around getting covid has been awful.(#7)Vacc‚Äôd+plus 3rd booster (I think Moderna mostly). Tested negative both times when I flew to see family for Christmas and also when coming back, w/a test kit. Had allergies and asthma probably due to the drastic warm to cold temperatures from FL to PA. Not to mention fams short haired dog probably bugged my nose, and slight mountain elevation (got a nose bleed a day or so later).

So, had nothing but what seems like a normal head cold or maybe Bronchitis (have had this a few times throughout my life). Hacking, coughing, runny nose, phlegm build up, nasal drip, the whole shebang that I get on my normal seasonal allergies. No headache, not really any soreness (unless it‚Äôs a hard cough), no fever or aches, no losing taste, etc.

Was gonna Neb too a few days ago; when it was really bad, but I realized both of the DC adapters were lost for both of the travel ones I have. Had to order from Amazon recently, so hope it fits and is universal plug.

Now I‚Äôm feeling better, after slamming allergy pills, theraflu/airborne, resting, hot water, steam shower, Albuterol/Advair. So idk what to think. Also, take all those medications too. Haven‚Äôt taken Singulair in a while though.(#8)I had Covid back in July 28th- August 5th I tested negative on that day. It truly never really bothered my asthma either thankfully! I suffer Graves‚Äô disease as well and inappropriate sinus tachycardia. It never bothered any of my health issues thankfully! Mucinex was my best bud and so was moving around and staying hydrated! Keep those hopes up and also us updated! Get well soon!(#9)Nice of you to do this. Dealing with covid now. 
  
Asthma, allergies and chronic sinuses, use Xolair, Xhance (Flonase), albuterol for rescue. Navage rinse everyday. 

So far I can say chest feels fine, but the freaking mucous production and sinuses inflammation is insane. Mucous is just causing throat irritation and indigestion (acid reflux) like crazy, leaving a constant metally taste.  I have cough but it‚Äôs mainly to clear mucous when I wake up more than it is uncontrollable. 

Struggling a little bit to get good deep breaths but thankfully it‚Äôs more upper airway restricted from inflammation and sinuses that‚Äôs making it tough. Albuterol has helped any times things seem to I get worse.  I‚Äôm vaccinated and boosted, if this is bad as it‚Äôs gets things are okay.(#10)I've also had covid back when everything started. My asthma medication helped tremendously.(#11)Glad it's been manageable for you.  I'm waiting on a test result myself.(#12)Just getting over covid right now. Triple vaxxed with Pfizer, currently take Breo 100. Had a couple small flare-ups this summer that required prednisone (my fault, went off my meds and the smoke was bad in our area). Had all the normal covid symptoms (cough, runny nose, etc.) and my asthma never got bad. Took my rescue a couple times just cuz I was congested but no issues and am almost fully recovered!! I also tend to get an itchy chin when my allergies and asthma flare-up and I got that once when I was really congested but breathing was okay and flow meter was normal!(#13)Same here! I'm on Singulair, breztri, and dupixent. Just tested covid positive. I don't feel good, but I'm hanging in there pretty well so far. I've had 3 Pfizer vaccines. I hope you feel better!(#14)I‚Äôm glad for you and thank you for the reassurance"
Asthma exacerbation,4,0.83,12,"(#1)I‚Äôm very allergic to cats/dogs and it makes my asthma so bad. Even DAYS after going over a friends house with a golden retriever I will have horrible asthma symptoms and need my nebulizer quite frequently. I‚Äôve pretty much avoided going over there now lol. It‚Äôs common for people who have allergic reactions to animals to have asthma flare up as well. Like I said mine will stay bad for 2-3 days after.(#2)Its very possible an allergy is pounding you days after the fact. My asthma can freak out up to 10 days after exposure to my triggers.(#3)I‚Äôm so sorry! Hope you can sleep. It‚Äôs really uncomfortable when nothing helps anymore. It‚Äôs a good idea to call your doctor, he/she will know what to do.
Get well soon!(#4)I hope by now you've been able to talk w/your doctor and are feeling better.(#5)Call EMS, seriously. Don‚Äôt risk it.(#6)I‚Äôve noticed that asthma symptoms don‚Äôt really hit until at least a day after being triggered then it‚Äôll last for a week or more.

Not sleeping and waking up because of asthma is the worst. Get into your doc/allergist/pulmonologist."
Inhaler usage,5,1.0,9,"(#1)That is alot for sure. Definitely on the uncontrolled side. Are you maxed out on maintenance medications?(#2)I do 2 for Albuterol and 1 for advair but they are both two times daily maintenance (I struggle w/keeping track sometimes). Just got back from seeing fam in PA, with a nasty head cold or maybe just really bad seasonal allergies (b/c I haven‚Äôt been home in a while, and forgot PA can get really cold).(#3)7 is a lot. My pulmonologist said I should not use my ventolin more than 4 times a day. Last week I did use my rescue inhaler a lot, as it didn‚Äôt really work. In the end I went to the ER and they gave me Prednisone. 
You should call your doctor if it continues to bother you(#4)If you are using your rescue inhaler more than 2-3 times a week, your asthma is not in control and you need to be on controller meds.(#5)Like others said, that‚Äôs a lot to be taking daily. However, I also use my rescue inhaler a lot, especially recently (I assume the cold weather and higher humidity is screwing with my asthma and sinuses.)

I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôve had asthma my entire life, been on inhalers since I was born/able to use one. For a couple years I wasn‚Äôt using any inhalers (around 2017-2019 or so) as I felt my asthma was getting slightly better. 

I got back on my rescue inhaler (Ventolin) around 7-8 months ago as I noticed my asthma was getting worse (I‚Äôm also a smoker of 3-4 years or so). I‚Äôm prescribed 1-2 puffs every 4 hours as needed, I‚Äôve been using it a lot recently, sometimes every hour, I‚Äôd say average 4-6 or more puffs/day. I ran out a couple days ago and I feel like I can barely breathe at times.

I‚Äôm trying to get back on a maintenance inhaler (Advair for me) since I feel that I‚Äôm using my rescue inhaler too much. My mom was able to talk to my Dr yesterday so I‚Äôm hoping that she mentioned my asthma to him. 

TL;DR - I‚Äôd try to make an appointment with your doctor to see if you could be prescribed an inhaler for maintenance/prevention. I haven‚Äôt been on a preventer for a long time now, but from what I remember, Advair as maintenance and Ventolin as a rescue worked very well at managing my asthma symptoms.(#6)I go for around 5-8 times during the day, and at least 6 at night on average"
Does this sound like asthma to you guys,2,0.67,6,"(#1)Inhaled steroids won't cause immune suppression. Oral steroids are what you're thinking of. You should take the inhaler, it does sound like asthma to me.(#2)Take the pulmicort. It's not going to make you any more likely to get Covid or pneumonia. Not treating the inflammation is going to put you at higher risk of getting sick.(#3)Yes . i get those symptoms as well just walking in the cold ! i also have uncontolled asthma"
Inhaled Steroid Dependency,0,0.37,40,"(#1)If it‚Äôs working for you, then ok‚Ä¶.But what you‚Äôre suggesting is actually very dangerous. You are much more likely to suffer from a severe attack this way. 

Asthma can‚Äôt be cured, only managed correctly. It‚Äôs possible for asthma to disappear on its own, but it can also reappear at any point. And that‚Äôs a huge gamble to take. It‚Äôs a bit like walking around with a loaded gun that could go off at any point. 

It‚Äôs far safer to manage your symptoms daily then suddenly find yourself in a dire situation without correct medication. The whole point of taking your maintenance inhaler is for *prevention* purposes - the steroid works by keeping your airways open for longer,    reducing your symptoms. 

Are you not worried about what kind of long-term damage your experiment could potentially cause?(#2)My need hasn't grown. It actually reduced as my lungs got healthier. One puff a day of Advair 100/50 keeps me clear if I stick with it every day. If I stop, my asthma starts to get bad like it was before I started Advair.(#3)You may be right, but this is dangerous advice to try without a doctor‚Äôs supervision. I‚Äôve known of enough people who have died of an asthma attack and I myself have come pretty close three times. 

Albuterol absolutely can cause a dependence.(#4)Asthma is a chronic condition. When you remove the thing that keeps the inflammation in check, the inflammation comes back. Untreated inflammation leads to a flare up.

Your math seems a bit off. 4 puffs a day of Fostair is 800mcg, not 2000mcg. To take 2000 mcg, you would be taking 10 puffs a day. Saying x is the equivalent of y is completely inaccurate. 

If you are using Beclomethasone (Qvar), 4 puffs a day is 320 mcg which is still not 2000mcg.(#5)If a person has asthma that is not being controlled properly, they‚Äôre at risk for airway remodelling. Basically, your lungs will become scarred from inflammation [(source)](https://asthma.ca/airway-remodelling-explained/), which will in turn likely make you more dependent on ICS when you have to go back on them or to a higher dose. I suggest if you don‚Äôt want to be more ‚Äúdependent‚Äù on ICS, stick with the dosage as prescribed by your doctor. Ultimately, if you believe you‚Äôre on too high of a dose, chat with your respirologist or allergist, or whoever treats your asthma. 
Even as someone who is suffering from endocrine issues from being on too high of a dose, I still take my inhalers daily and will continue to do so to be able to breathe comfortably. My allergist and endocrinologist changed my combo inhaler to two separate ones and are making sure I can still breathe and making sure the new ones aren‚Äôt having such a large systemic effect. I hope your doctors can be as helpful as mine with your treatment and asthma education and management!(#6)100% Agree with this post, and it's actually a thing that is taken seriously in the UK. The support we get in the UK is that you manage your medication to your needs and not the recommended dosage . I for example only need inhaled steroids once every couple of days or when I have a chest infection, where as the manufacturer recommends once per day. 

If you actually look into steroid side effects, one can be that it can make your asthma worse!

Just manage your dosage to what you need, and not what other think you need.(#7)I have wondered about this before too, but as you note it‚Äôs a very difficult cycle to break. If you look at topical steroid withdrawal, it can persist for years, so it‚Äôs difficult to know what the solution is for asthma (since ‚Äútoughing it out‚Äù isn‚Äôt really an option). 

One mechanism that could be at play here too is silent reflux; steroid inhalers are known to make it worse.(#8)How do you go about your day without asthma relief? I can't stop what I'm doing for 30 minutes at least for an exacebation to pass.(#9)ICS definitely makes my body weaker. I am getting fatigued more easier. I would drink half the amount I drank before ICS and feel like I didn‚Äôt sleep for a few days. It doesn‚Äôt help with sex life either. Similar to your situation, in the span of 3 months, I have tried 3 times to stop Flovent (without tapering) and start new ICS and failed miserably. I would get extreme fatigued and had to go back to Flovent. I am starting to think I am stuck with It. I went from 110mcg 4x daily to 110mcg 2x daily and feel much better . Every time I increased the dose I paid the price!(#10)There are articles around that show that asthma can get worse with taking long term inhalers!! Simbicort being one of them that increases the chances of a deadly flare up!"
I'm using inhalers to much and I believe its affecting my behavior,23,0.93,31,"(#1)Uuuuuh talk to both your allergist/pulmonologist and a psychiatrist, my dude. There is no healthy way to be using a whole inhaler in a week. That's an incredible overdose.(#2)You need to see a pulmonologist badly.
You are using beyond too much of your rescue inhaler. You need to be on a controller medication.
Please find some help.
Your heart will thank you.
Your family will thank you. 
Your lungs and mental health will thank you.
Life is too short to be in misery, my friend.(#3)You need to see your doctor and ideally also a therapist to help you deal with anxiety and addiction.

The rule of thumb is the rescue inhaler should not be used more than 2-3 times a week.(#4)I think it's the other way around. You shouldn't really be using your inhaler more than 6 times a week. If you are, you need a maintenance inhaler in addition to the rescue. 
Please get checked by your doctor(#5)If you used your inhaler up in a week, it isn‚Äôt because of Asthma. Sounds like a behavioral problem\habit. 

Look into Singulair or long term relief that you take once a day. Maybe Advair.

Over use of inhaler actually makes it worse, so you are taking an inhaler to solve a problem you see causing.(#6)when i started using flovant FIRST FEW WEEKS i had this but it was a whole new inhaler that was new to me and i havent tried . i had it all . anxiety and anger , as for rescue inhalers i was fine tho(#7)My sister was using her rescue inhaler this way and ended up intubated in the ER. Your rescue inhaler has adrenaline. You are jolting your body each time. After a time, your body won't respond and you'll need a machine to help you breathe. Heed what the others are saying and get examined ASAP.(#8)Is it Ventolin (albuterol)? I used to have this problem but I got switched to Symbicort as needed and now only very rarely need anything.

Used to go through insane amounts of Ventolin tho.(#9)Just another +1 to the fact that this is not good - you need to be on a maintenance inhaler, like a Symbicort, QVar, etc.

You should definitely discuss this with your doctor.(#10)You are putting yourself at risk of a cardiac arrest. Albuterol and all bronchodilators prolong the QT interval. This is an overdose! See a doctor please.(#11)Sea moss gel, herbal teas Mullein leaf good to detox lungs, exercise yoga, control breathing, stop smoking, steam is what helped me, gotta make changes eat more fruits and greens"
Child with possible asthma symptoms,2,0.75,5,"(#1)Anxiety can absolutely cause shortness of breath, but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not totally ruling out asthma. Saw you‚Äôve already taken her to her pediatrician, if it‚Äôs allowed on your insurance I‚Äôd try to get in to see an asthma specialist of some kind (pulmonologist is who I saw originally for my asthma). They can test & evaluate her to see if she has it and how severe it is. They‚Äôll also know a little better how to interpret what she says or the right questions to ask to help pinpoint the issue. 

I wouldn‚Äôt judge the severity based solely on what she‚Äôs told you. When I was a kid I told my mom that chlorine pools made my throat hurt and she brushed it off because it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for pools to bother her as well (she does not have asthma - my guess is I just didn‚Äôt know how to say how bad it was). Turns out I‚Äôm really sensitive to chlorine bleach fumes and have likely had asthma my whole life that didn‚Äôt noticeably flare until I was old enough to know and communicate that something was really wrong. I also complained in gym classes growing up that exercise and going outside when it was cold ‚Äúmade my throat hurt‚Äù (didn‚Äôt know that it was more tightness in my airways and to explain it that way), the gym teachers always just told me I was out of shape (a skinny little kid‚Ä¶ out of shape‚Ä¶). They didn‚Äôt mention it to my parents or recommend to them I get checked out. Not saying you‚Äôre dismissing her symptoms at all, but it can be hard for kids to explain when they don‚Äôt know what it is or the right words to use to describe it. I hope you get to the bottom of it and she feels better soon!(#2)Sounds like this is something you should discuss with the pediatrician."
Colds always become bronchitis - how to prevent/treat,34,0.96,32,"(#1)Okay, so my methods may be weird, but they really do work for me. So here goes:

1. Gargle. LOADS. 
2. Tea. LOADS. Add honey, and not sugar. I hated tea before, but it really is a game changer. 
3. Whenever I feel a cold creeping up, I wear socks. 
4. I use a montelukast tablet if I feel like it‚Äôs creeping into my chest, but otherwise I stick to a a nasal spray or nasal corticosteroid. 
5. Increase my vitamin C consumption using the effervescent tablets that you put in water. 
6.  Avoid everything cold, everything citrus-y, and ketchup. 
7. Pop a few tablespoons of oil into a cup and and microwave it. Once it‚Äôs warm to the touch, massage it over your chest and throat. 

I‚Äôve been managing myself this way. It may not be the most scientific, but it really does work for me. I hope it works for you!(#2)[deleted](#3)Advair doesn't just help with wheezing, it reduces inflammation in the airways. This does two things. First, it reduces the amount of phlegm you produce, which means you'll cough less, and your lungs won't turn into a great home for bacteria (which lead to bronchitis). And second, it makes it much less likely your small airways will constrict. **You should for sure keep using the Advair, now and every other time you're sick.**

It might behoove you to start an ICS-only inhaler during your healthy times, as well. I'm on Flovent normally, but when I got my positive covid test result last week, I immediately whipped out the old Symbicort inhaler I still had from earlier in the year. Covid still sucks, but at least I can (mostly) breathe.(#4)This is a common side effect of inhaled corticosteroids. Singulair/Montelukast is a leukotriene inhibitor, which is a different kind of anti-inflammatory, and I don't know if the same side effect has common occurrence.

I strongly suggest you find a doctor who takes this situation seriously as mine does. Bronchitis can easily become pneumonia in compromised lungs, and repeated pneumonia is hard on your alveoli, and it is MUCH harder to heal those than manage your bronchial inflammation.

What my doctor does, whenever a cold hits my chest, is put me on a prophylactic regimen of an antibiotic and Gauifenesin 600mg 12 hour extended release (this is a specific formulation of Mucinex available OTC) as well as instructions to use albuterol twice a day as long as there is any mucus or chest pain and tightness. The point is to stop a secondary bacterial infection in its tracks, keep the oxygen flowing in, and keep the mucus moving out. This regimen is very effective for me with minimal side effects.(#5)I did that. Every single time. I have chronic bronchitis on my chart
Then covid. I always use masks. Hand sanitize and clean everything I touch. And I have been remarkably well.
I agree with all the protocol to try to just stay well with vitamin c and gargle.
I do know that it sucks so bad to go from stuffy nose to full blown lung infection every single time but I hope your can stay well!(#6)Nasal rinse with warm distilled water and 1 packet of saline powder. Use a netti pot or dental water pic with nasal attachment for the wash. all of which can be found at Walmart. 

Also, this also used to be my reality before I got Nasal Polyp removal. 

Might wanna go to a ENT doctor (ear nose and throat) and get your sinuses checked for nasal polyps.(#7)Netti pot, use your symptom meds (albuterol, etc. - not control meds) as soon as you feel a tickle in your chest, and pop a mucinex every day.

That's about all there is to it in my experience.(#8)Larix by Eclectic labs.(#9)i had this basically every month when i was in middle school (thankfully went away in highschool for some reason)

i dont know how to avoid it but i was always prescribed Azithromycin by my pediatrician back then. i also wasnt diagnosed with asthma back then (no one would take me to get tested ) so it might be different for you. but that is whathelped me(#10)My colds become cough-variant asthma which I have found to successfully be cured by montelukast in a very short period of time. I was told before that it was bronchitis.  What exactly is the difference?  

I suffered so many times my whole life but montelukast totally worked for me after taking so many different meds. Seems like doctors were freaking just guessing my whole life?

I was put on various inhalers, Advair, and that cough syrup rappers like.  None worked on my chronic cough.(#11)I have similar issues‚Ä¶ i have persistent allergic asthma. Recently I started being more stuffy and producing phlegm more than usual. When that happens I start to wheeze but it is coming from my upper respiratory system (throat) rather than my lungs. I believe it is related to cold since right now there is really no environmental allergens in the air (pollen, ragweed etc). Being stuffy is not a problem for me but I want to get rid of this quiet wheezing I have. I have been prescribed Breo and Symbicort but they really dont work that good. i have also tried montelukast but I feel like it is not  doing anything for me. Can someone tell me what else can I try? I see people mention Advair, is that better than Breo/symbicort? Thanks"
Hands-free portable nebulizer?,1,0.67,7,"(#1)If you are using a nebulizer a lot, you need to be on a controller med. Please talk to your doctor about your concerns and get on the correct medication.(#2)I use this one - https://www.omron-healthcare.co.uk/nebulisers/MicroAir_U100.html

It's not specifically advertised as hands free, but it's quite light and I have tightened the mask elastic and used it hands free sometimes. 

It's also the right kind of size for me to rest the battery end on my chest, so if you're doing something sitting down, that might be worth trying?

Congratulations on your pregnancy - all the best of luck!(#3)It‚Äôs not ‚Äúhands free‚Äù technically but I use a flyp nebulizer and am able to hold it with my mouth while I nebulize. I still use the big one and keep it because it is slightly more reliable. You have to make sure to charge your flyp, get new pieces when they recommend, deep clean it, etc because if not it will have issues working. It‚Äôs a life saver though for when I travel and need to nebulize and way more reliable than any other portable nebulizer I‚Äôve tried!

Exercise induced asthma,8,0.9,16,"(#1)Montelukast/Singulair was invented for this. I've taken it daily for 20 years or more with no ill effects.(#2)Albuterol inhaler a few minutes before working out is the typical thing that helps the most. I know you can find albuterol inhalers OTC.(#3)When I hadn't been able to get an inhaler or Dr's appointment Primatene tablets worked more effectively than Bronkaid ones for whatever reason.  Take it an hr or so prior.  

If you're one to drink coffee prior to a workout then the suggestion would be to take a Baby Aspirin [as in the ECA stack,](https://www.healthline.com/health/eca-stack#ingredients-indepth) or Taurine to avoid any heart rhythm issue.  Not a long-term solution (due to liver/kidney issues) but will tide you over until you can get to a doctor.  The mist does the job but not quite as well as Ventolin will.(#4)On the same boat. I use the preventive inhaler 20 mins before the workout. Albuterol is not the preventive one but a rescue inhaler. 
Also I take montekulast in the night for good deep sleep. This helps in the muscle repair part of the workout.(#5)If you recently started working out again, you may simply be working out harder than your current fitness level allows so it may not be asthma at all. Try dialing back the workouts and see if it improves. It beats being on meds for the rest of your life if you don't actually need them.(#6)If anything, I usually take Ventolin before I start exercising, and then it doesn't seem so bad working out."

Good luck!(#14)Booster isnt as bad :) i just had some congestion and a minor cough .(#15)Felt tired with the 1st one but 2nd and booster had no symptoms whatsoever, all of them were from Pfizer. (19 M)(#16)Asthma was noticeable but completely tolerable.  I made sure to take the next day off and away from other triggers.    The booster ended up being the easiest of them all for me.   


I plan like I‚Äôm going to have a cold/flu; variety of medicines for any symptoms and my inhaler on hand, take the day off to relax, it‚Äôs nothing compared to being actually sick.   It‚Äôs worth it.(#17)As a child I was hospitalized multiple times as a from severe asthma, in adulthood it would be severe during allergy season and merely moderate in the winter. Between 2017 and spring of 2020 my asthma was in remission almost completely, a blessing I never thought I'd get to experience. After my initial Pfizer injections my asthma has come back with such severity that I'm on a daily inhaled steroid and my doc is worried about permanent airway remodeling. I'm not fucking touching the booster. Your mileage may vary."

Symbicort cough?,1,0.67,8,(#1)Try to get in and see your doctor tomorrow and get a different combo inhaler(#2)I just stop symbicort last few days for few side effects I use a different inhaler(#3)If it is a powder inhaler‚Ä¶it may contain milk proteins. The pharmaceutical companies use lactose in the powder. My daughter was using the respiclick albuterol because she didn‚Äôt want to tote a spacer.

SOB @ beach due to smokers,22,0.96,15,"(#1)Cigarette smoke is one of my worst triggers. Even walking down the street downtown here (full of smokers) can really mess me up. Not fun. 

And most smokers are kind of agro about it, likely because they feel like they can‚Äôt smoke anywhere with the bylaws.

I also can‚Äôt stay at my moms very long, because even if she doesn‚Äôt smoke in the house anymore, the lingering smoke on clothes and other items starts getting to me in an hour or so. I of course get called ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù and that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äù‚Ä¶. But yeah, not fun. 

For the downtown issue, I wear an n95 and that seems to help quite a bit.(#2)Oof. I feel that. I have shitty neighbors who get paid to blow cigarette smoke through my apartment window.(#3)I find I have a worse reaction to smoke outside where I am in clean air, than I used to in really smokey environments.(#4)Timely post. I have lived in a condo that allows smoking for two years. No one around me smoked but a couple moved in early in December that are chain smokers. I decompensated pretty quickly after having really stable asthma for 3 years. I feel really stuck. I had to go on a big burst of prednisone and am on the taper now. I know I won‚Äôt get better here and it‚Äôs overwhelming to think about having to move. I own that I should have known better and the HOA does not care or want to deal with initiating a no-smoking policy. Yes, asthma really sucks.(#5)I would ask them to stop smoking. 

Is that not illegal on public beaches anyways?"
Wheezy,3,1.0,3,"(#1)Sounds like you need to stay on top of your health in your current scenario.  Continue seeking treatment from medical professionals until your asthma is controlled.  Don't stop until your satisfied.  Using Albuterol regularly is not a good long term plan.  I see a primary care Dr., Asthma Specialist, and Ent(#2)Sounds like you should go to A&E along with requesting a referral to a pulmonary specialist.(#3)If your asthma is overall relatively mild (Seretide 50 is a relatively low dose inhaler), you won't be going to a respiratory consultant (the other posters don't know how the NHS works). All you need to is get an appointment with your GP for an Asthma Review, explain that despite the recent intervention with antibiotics and oral steroids still haven't improved things overall, and you think it might be related to your preventer inhaler instead. Don't go to A&E unless you're having an acute exacerbation, it wastes their time and yours. They don't deal with chronic diseases that aren't acutely flared up. 

If you have access to an Asthma Nurse, speak to them as well. Good luck."
"I've covid, now what?",22,0.93,28,"(#1)Jacksepticeye, a youtuber, has asthma and recently recovered from Covid. They got him antibodies, though. Most research seems to suggest that the newest variant hits the lungs a lot less than previous ones. Hope you recover quickly üíú(#2)Do you use a steroid maintenance inhaler?  If not maybe ring your doctor and see if they can prescribe you one, at least until you've cleared out all the mucus?    If you don't already have one I'd look at getting a finger blood oxygen tester too.   They're about $20 and will help reassure you that your blood oxygen levels are OK and if they're not then you know for sure it's time to head to the hospital.   I find them very reassuring as it's a more clear line of problem and not problem than do I ""Feel"" sick enough.(#3)Are you on maintenance inhaler? It will help speed up the recovery process.(#4)I‚Äôm positive with covid and have severe asthma, think my anxiety about it was worse then the covid. 

Take musinex DM consistently to thin the Phelgm. This is an important regiment that needs to be done.

It has to be the one with 1200 MG Guaifeson. Take to to clear up.

Call your doctor immediately and make them aware that you are struggling. They can tell you at what point to get emergency care. 
Stay hydrated. Have a plan. Make sure someone is aware that you are ill. You need to be checked on. 
TAKE ALL OF YOUR CONTROLLER MEDS.
Without fail.
Please keep us updated.(#6)I‚Äôm 23 years of age & I‚Äôve always had really bad asthma. I was an athlete in hs but not anymore in college. Anyway, it‚Äôs been a little more than 2 weeks and I still feel like shit. I don‚Äôt really wheeze, but that impending feeling that an asthma attack is about to happen is always there. There‚Äôs a certain itch you feel like your throat when your asthma starts to get bad & that feeling has been with me through the entire duration of my COVID symptoms. I bought a little oxygen monitor to make sure everything‚Äôs alright while I sleep, but my sleep time and quality have definitely gone down the drain bc of my breathing. Like I said, I had pretty bad asthma even before this COVID thing. I‚Äôm taking prednisone, advair, symbicort, and albuterol (obviously) lol. Two days ago my sense of taste and smell dramatically changed. Things started to taste different and I began to smell less. This is anecdotal to me. You might fair better against this virus. My the odds be in your favor friend.(#7)You need to let your regular doctor know that you have covid.(#8)First.. don't let anxiety get the best of you. I know it's hard because this is scary, but anxiety will make your breathing worse. 
I had covid in December of 2020. I am a longhauler who isn't vaccinated (due to heart issues), and people in my home have covid now. 
Vitamins are your friend! C, d, and zinc. Albuterol every 4 hours. Mucinex as directed on bottle. Sleep on your stomach, if possible. At least on your side. I made sure to get up and walk around for about 10 minutes every hour I was awake.

Wishing you the best!(#9)On top of the great suggestions in the comments, I‚Äôd like to add: keep a pulse oximeter handy (or get one if you don‚Äôt). As long as your oxygen saturation stays between 95-99 percent consistently and your heart rate isn‚Äôt crazy high, you‚Äôre okay. If it consistently gets under 92%, it‚Äôs time to call your doctor. 

My pulse ox helped me stay grounded through some pretty tough waves of symptoms (I‚Äôm recovering now).(#10)Sounds like you should be calling your doctor or going to urgent care.(#11)First off, I wish you luck! Sending love and healing

I got it about a year ago and it definitely made my lungs worse. My recommendation is once you're off quarantine to visit your Dr to adjust meds and make sure you do more for your lungs than you normally do. I didn't notice a big change until 3 months after I was sick, where I had to get steroids, and then 7 months later had an asthma attack. 

When I was actually sick, sleeping up or on the left was best for me. This doesn't work for all people, but if you also have nasal issues, breathe through your nose while the nebulizer is on, this can help with the mucus and inflammation. I can't do this every time because it makes my nose bleed, but that's a pretty uncommon side effect - I have other respiratory issues(#12)Maintenance inhaler. Mucinex daily. Warm liquids. Avoid caffeine and things that can dehydrate you. Get outside and get some fresh warm air in your lungs. Steam in the shower too.(#13)I had Covid-19, then influenza A 6 weeks later.  I've been using Qvar twice a day, Dulera twice a day, and Pro Air every 4 hrs.  It's been a long miserable road.(#14)Depending on the country you're in its definitely worth to call your doc ASAP. It's certainly better to get ahead of the infection rather than wait too long.
I had regular calls with my primary physician who also prescribed inhalers etc over the phone (actually only got asthma diagnosis because of covid, what fun!). As soon as I was allowed I went to the pulmonologist to check thoroughly, and they increased my meds dosages substantially. I know my pulm also offers phone support for those still in quarantine, for example, so that's worth checking out - you call for a phone appointment and the doctor will then call you back for a ""phone visit"". My case was probably special in that it's the first time my asthma showed, but it took me several weeks to get the medication right.(#15)I'm on day 5 dealing with covid. I am prescribed symbicort once per day however if a cold is coming in I increase to 2x per day. I immediately increased to 2x per day. I also start taking mucinex 1200mg 2x per day and significantly increase my fluids. In addition, I now have a humidifier going in my room to help.

Best of luck to you and please go to the ER if you need to.(#16)Hi my love, I am in the same boat! I am on Day 4 with severe asthma. Let the anxiety go, the shortness of breathe won‚Äôt be permanent. Take your nebulizer twice a day at the very least, boil some water and breathe in the hot steamy air (I recommend putting a towel over your head to steam). 

I have a ton of phlegm too. If you need an asthma support buddy, please feel free to message me. We will get through this together!(#17)I‚Äôve got severe asthma and recently tested positive three days ago. Started with a severe headache. Like your skull is being squeezed. It went from that to a full blown head cold then I could start to feel it moving to my chest. Been a rough ride with keeping it controlled. I can‚Äôt seem to cough up anything other than in the mornings. When I do it‚Äôs so thick exactly like gum. I use preventative inhaler, do my nebulizer treatment, I take 2 Mucinex DM in am and pm, and take the prednisone that was given by a nurse over the phone. I did get both doses of the vaccine and was scheduled to get booster next week actually. So far it just feels like I have mild asthma that can‚Äôt seem to be controlled. Staying upright, drinking ginger shots and tea anything warm with lemon has extremely helped. Lots of steamy showers. Yesterday I took five. I hope you feel better soon. People that don‚Äôt have asthma don‚Äôt know our fear or how we have to handle situations like this. Peace & Light(#18)I‚Äôm an asthmatic who caught covid 19 17/12/21 unfortunately I‚Äôm still quite unwell. I‚Äôm on a steroid preventer (Breo) as well as ventolin. I got a low dose of prednisone as well and slowly seem to be getting better. The thing that helps the most is my nebuliser, you can put nebules of saline (salt water) or ventolin in (if you have a prescription for the nebule form) You can buy saline and a nebuliser off the shelf. Nebulisers are fairly expensive, around $150 AUD but they last for 20+ years and saline nebules are very cheap. There may be an option to rent or borrow a nebuliser where you live."
COVID exposure triggered exacerbation?,2,0.75,6,"(#1)Kind of sounds like anxiety to me, which is completely valid and can make asthma symptoms worse or mimic worsening asthma symptoms. Having had multiple negative tests post-exposure, the likelihood of having had it with all false negatives is slim to none.(#2)There are other viruses than covid out there. I know RSV is running around the US right now, and has been since summer(#3)I think that if you had had Covid, you would have a positive PCR test for around the next three months. So it‚Äôs likely not that. 

But.. I don‚Äôt know. I feel like I keep seeing people who are saying their asthma has gotten worse since they got the booster. I am by no means an anti-vaxxer, I‚Äôve just seen a handful of those posts on here I think. Could that be an explanation? That‚Äôs just anecdotal though Or just the weather plus anxiety of the everything in the world right now ?"
Did Pfizer vaccine trigger anyone‚Äôs asthma?,4,0.67,21,"(#1)Nope!(#2)Pfizer 1,2+ booster. No issues at all.(#3)I'm postponing my booster because of a thread here where people complained Pfizer triggered their asthma. I'm stupid I know, it's just that my asthma has been so controlled and well in the last years I really don't wanna mess it up.(#4)yep(#5)I had the moderna shot and had severe chest pain for a few days. It was so horrific I Had to take prescription painkillers to numb the pain, I should have gone to the emergency room to be honest.(#6)I was fine. Just a sore arm and mild fever for a couple of days both times. The booster is not available here yet.(#7)I can't prove that mine did, but I suspect the third shot caused my week long chest tightness."
Question about Asthma Control...,0,0.5,3,"(#1)Im very sorry for your attack and how scary it is to have one.  Not a doctor or anything but I do have a couple of points to offer that might help. 
1- Have a plan for who to call if/when it happens again. Someone else may be able to drive you to urgent care and confirm if you need an ambulance? If not, ambulance it is.
2- talk to your doctor about a home nebulizer. Its way less expensive than an ER visit and ambulance ride.(#2)If things have returned to normal, simply let your doc know you had an attack and ask him what you should do as far as an action plan. One bad attack doesn't mean your asthma is out of control. 

You may also have GERD (quite common for people with asthmatics) and eating so late at night could have made things worse than they would've have been otherwise.(#3)IMHO, most people who are diligent about following a competent doctor's recommendation should not get worse. Asthma should be a controllable condition. What ""not get worse"" means can vary from person to person, but it should be very objectively definable for you when comparing the present to the past. What we know about this disease suggests that for the vast majority of people who are not actively doing lung damaging things, the progression can be stopped where it is."
Has anyone been able to get off Singulair after being on it for years?,5,1.0,23,"(#1)i had to stop it cold turkey at 13 after taking it for a year  (didnt tell doctor bc bad doctor) due to the severity of the physical and mental side effects(#2)Yeah it‚Äôs been a week but I‚Äôve contemplated getting back on. I‚Äôve had the worst cramps and muscle aches and terrible brain fog and feeling like I‚Äôm losing it.(#3)Did you just stop taking it or taper off of it? I saw an article awhile ago about needing to taper off of Zyrtec. I know they are different types of meds, but Singulair may need to be tapered also. I've been on it for years and need to stay on it for now.(#4)I went cold turkey (per Dr's suggestion) after years on it with no issues. Are you taking a nasal spray to help with your congestion?(#5)I'm working towards getting off of it, because my doctor thinks my asthma has improved enough. 

I'm on Xolair and allergy shots. I currently still need it, so we're increasing my allergy shot strength to see if that will be enough.(#6)I quit it cold turkey as a teen and had the worst withdrawal symptoms it felt like. If I ever want to stop again I'd probably taper it. I've also had to taper off zyrtex as someone above mentioned. Which was the oddest thing but I definitely had to taper it.

I'd recommend a nasal spray. There's a lot out there though. Flonase is a common one, I use rhinocort because I can't do the steriod in Flonase(#7)What side effects?(#8)I tried not taking it and within a day or two, I noticed the inflammation in the lungs and sinuses get significantly worse. I was wondering if that was a rebound effect, or if my condition is just that bad these days! If it's a rebound I'd be willing to stay off of it for longer and see if I can maybe get over it.(#9)Have you noticed any difference so far? I've also decided to stop Singulair for awhile & go back to an inhaler as needed (my doctor subbed out albuterol for Singulair years ago). I've been dealing with increasing muscle pain & fatigue & looking back, I feel like it all started to get worse when I started Singulair. My blood tests have been showing signs of inflammation. I've also been dealing with severe depression, anxiety, & OCD, worse than it's ever been in the past. After finding out about the black box warning, I've decided to wean myself off of the medication to see if any of my symptoms improve. I've had to wean off other medications before, so I'm just going to follow the same protocol. (Reduce to every other day for a week, then half a pill every other day, then a quarter, then done.)"
Can asthma disappear completely?,14,0.86,16,"(#1)Adult onset asthma here, I've seen in the last ten years of having asthma some periods of no asthma symptoms, lasting from one month to six months but it always comes back.(#2)It can never disappear or completely heal. Once you have it, it will be always a part of you just as an allergy. However, it can get better, become less bothersome or become dormant.(#3)Had asthma my whole life.  Very severe as a child multiple hospitalizations, somewhat well-managed (rescue inhaler before exercise and a few times a week) as an adult, no hospitalizations.  It has never gone away.  In the literature I don't think asthma is ever ""healed"" or in remission from what I've read.  There may be interesting edge cases worth exploring.  I subscribe to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene\_hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis) as the casual factor in explaining my own asthma troubles.  Basically, this hypothesis implies a ""miscalibrated"" immune system that isn't trained on enviornmental microrganisms correctly as a child leading to an inflammatory response as your immune system reacts to everything rather than ""real"" potential agents.  As such, I believe that until we learn how to ""reboot"" that immune system as an adult I'll probably be stuck with the disease my whole life.   


That being said, I exercise, I live a full life, and don't really feel like asthma gets in my way or hinders my life (except in the minor annoyance of asthma attacks and when it jumps on board other respiratory ailments and makes for a bad time).  

The key for me is all the environmental factors that doctors don't really focus on because many people have trouble following the advice.  Alcohol made it worse.  Sugar makes it way way way worse.  Carbonated drinks bad.  Dirty environments make it uncomfortable.  Clean eating, drinking lots of water, and exercise (especially cardio) have always helped I think.  When I get off this bandwagon my asthma increases.  When I lived in a temperate climate (San Francisco) it was very very rare that I'd get an asthma attack so it can kinda go into mini-""remission""

So yeah, tl;dr asthma is annoying, but if you live a healthy lifestyle then its more than manageable.  Modern medicine + healthy eating + stay hydrated + exercise.  Hope this helps.(#4)Mine went completely for several years. Didn't need to see doctor or get a prescription for a decade.

Then a particularly bad chest infection of some kind and VERY slow reactions from my GP brought it back worse than as a child...

So yes given my experiences its possible.(#5)When it's completely under control, it feels as though it's disappeared. What helped me the most was controlling my asthma triggers - mainly allergies. I had an allergy test and got on two different types of daily allergy meds. Those, plus my daily asthma control med (Advair), have helped it feel like it's gone completely. I have breakthrough asthma though when the triggers are really bad. We went fishing at a REALLY OLD and MOLDY enclosed fishing dock and the level of mold and dust was enough to cut through all my meds.(#6)It typically just lies dormant. I went 7 years and had only 1 asthma attack, and then I had a really bad exacerbation which ended that awesome trend.(#7)For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôd had asthma well into my thirties, but for reasons I‚Äôve never understood it completely disappeared literally up until three weeks ago. I‚Äôm now 58. I had no need for inhalers or any GP supervision in the intervening period. 

Suddenly from nowhere it‚Äôs returned. I have no clue why, whether it‚Äôs something or nothing, or permanent, but I‚Äôm now back on ventolin. 

So, I guess the answer at least from my experience is yes it can disappear virtually permanen‚Ä¶or maybe not. Sorry I can‚Äôt be more certain.(#8)i find the more i keep my asthma under tight control, and minimize flareups, the better off it gets. 

I had a cold last week that bounced off me, and i didn‚Äôt need extra ventolin or a round of prednisone. I‚Äôve not needed pred for most of the pandemic and so it‚Äôs been nice, honestly.(#9)It sure would be nice!! Asthma is such a pain in the ass!(#10)I have childhood onset asthma and it went dormant for like 2 years and is now flared up. I do think In certain people they might outgrow it forever tho, I believe it is possible in childhood onset cases.(#11)My asthma is triggered by a cold usually or a virus. We worked & studied from home as a family from March 2020 until August 2021. We had plenty of outdoors time for sports & activities. During that time I had no asthma at all, needed no medication.
I almost thought it went away.
Kids went to school in August, brought home first colds within the week and my asthma started again ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
Going through a bad week or so now as well!!(#12)I've heard/read several times of people who had it as kids who 'outgrew' it.  I read a book called 'Reversing Astha', by Richard Firshein, D.O., where he described patients whom he helped a great deal through diet and other changes (it's been a while since I read it, so I don't remember a lot of the details).  I don't think it's 'reversible' for everyone, of course, but maybe for some people.(#13)I was wondering the same. I never had asthma until I was in my 50‚Äôs and it was catalyzed by a long bout with bronchitis/upper respiratory infection. After I coughed some gross stuff out of my lungs after trying for several months, I‚Äôve been better and completely stable on an extremely low dose of steroid inhaler. I‚Äôm also on a low dose of Dupixent but, I never have any issues. (Cross fingers)(#14)I healed from asthma after I was punched in the back and broke.my spine fractured 8 vertebrae and collapsed lung I don't need a Inhaler anymore I can barely breathe"
Brio Elipta experiences,3,1.0,22,"(#1)Breo has been great for me for a few years now(#2)Breo is the magic I need. No rebound effects.(#3)Breo wasn't great for me but symbicort helps so much. Every person is different and something different will work. I tried 4 inhalers I think before symbicort(#4)I've been taking breo for over two years now. It's worked fantastic for me! No negative side effects.(#5)For me the Breo was worse. I avoid all the powdered inhalers. A majority use lactose in the powder.(#6)Breo makes my voice really hoarse and gives me horrible sore throats. I have tried washing my mouth and teeth and nothing worked. I had to stop breo for those reasons. I have heard all powdered inhalers do this.(#7)I have never been on Symbicort. Usually my treatment is Ventolin than Breo for a month. I go off Breo when I don‚Äôt have asthma, so there are periods where I don‚Äôt need it for a year or so.
I don‚Äôt notice any side effects with Breo.(#8)Breo worked for me for awhile and then it quit being as effective so my doctor adjusted my meds.(#9)I had issues with Symbicort and Elipta, not so much with my asthma they worked wonders for that , it was my heart doing weird inverted beats, and skipping beats etc, it got to the point I was worried I was going to drop and die, I went to a few doctors even a lung specialist, who advised some asthma meds can much around with heart beats and flutters etc, does anyone get the same effects?(#10)Breo is great! I have way better asthma control on it than with seretide and other preventers.(#11)Interest on how you will do with Brio. I have been on Symbicort for a week and has been super fatigued. I think it‚Äôs also making my asthma worse."
Do inhalers have suicidal thoughts as a side effect,0,0.5,7,"(#1)I am not a doctor, but dont really think so. I ve been using them for 2 years and they had absolutely no such effect. Inhalers are pretty safe.(#2)No, they do not.(#3)Inhalers are a factor for anxiety, and anxiety uncontrolled will spiral as far as you allow.  

It doesn't do anything with your thoughts as much as it changes your breathing pattern just as asthma does without the medication.  The steroids cause heart racing and this can increase physical symptoms that may kick start anxious thought patterns, or like tense sensations from an asthma attack.

And a warm reminder that You are not your thoughts. You don't have to claim any of the thoughts in your head, there are no consequences of letting them go with the wind. (Ive had suicidal ideation for most of my life)(#4)Montekukast is the one and only inhaler I‚Äôve used that affected me mentally. I took that shit for month and had some dark thoughts that I‚Äôve never had before or since I threw in trash.  It was very effective for asthma control though. 


Besides that the 10 day prednisone cycles make me emotional wreck but nothing mentally besides that."
Viral asthma,21,0.87,33,"(#1)Not only (I have allergic and non allergic asthma, so I have a few triggers), but it definitely bothers for a few weeks after an infection.
Do you also suffer from shortness of breath? Sometimes my ventolin does not help a lot when the airways are very irritated(#2)Yes, my asthma is primarily from viral infection/respiratory illness. Otherwise it‚Äôs only slightly triggered by environmental stuff like smoke. It can be so frustrating, recovering from a simple cold and feeling better in other ways, but still struggling to breathe for weeks and having to go get steroids and stuff :((#3)Yes. I get it from other things too, but the worst is a viral infection. Kicks my asthma up for weeks.(#4)Curious if anyone has had Covid and how it was?? I don‚Äôt currently have Covid but am so scared to get it bc of asthma(#5)Sea moss, diet, herbal teas, exercise(#6)Yeah and i hate it(#7)It‚Äôs always been common for me.(#8)Yes, I have viral asthma as well, and I have the same issue.(#9)This would more likely be bronchitis and not asthma.(#10)I know my most common day-to-day triggers are exercise, heavy perfumes/scents (like vape clouds), seasonal allergies, and extreme temperatures. I do get a pesky cough that sticks with me for a few weeks after I'm over a cold. I can just take my inhaler and that'll almost always solve it. It's when I get out of breath from coughing spasms that I run into trouble."
My nose is itchy,38,0.91,14,"(#1)What filters are you using for that and what are they rated as? I've got some disposable 3M N95's generally shaped like that but the filters look different. I just recently got one that will take replaceable cartridges and need to research what will block fragrance/cleaner.(#2)If you just want N95 protection, you can get empty cartridges for those masks that hold N95 inserts. The 3M part numbers are:

5N11

603 Filter Adapter

501 Retainer

If buying from Amazon or eBay, make sure that your suppliers are likely selling genuine 3M parts.(#3)I‚Äôve using one since the beginning of the pandemic whenever I have to be outside (fortunately, not a lot). Very comfortable and enough coupled with p95 or p99 filters. Cheaper in the long run, too.(#4)Wearing that thing all the time will make your asthma feel worse. Your lungs will work harder and it will not be fun. Just get  decent N95 masks that you throw away after use. They work just as good for covid but you won't put strain on your lungs.(#5)Is that a mask or medicine?both?(#6)I have that one also!!"
Involuntary Gasp,4,0.75,5,(#1)I have experienced that(#2)Could be breathing dysfunction. Speak to whoever is treating your asthma about a referral to respiratory physiotherapy.(#3)This happens to every last person in the world.
"Those of you who have asthma, got vaxxed and got omicron, how was it?",48,0.96,64,"(#1)I am dealing with it now. Was fully vaxxed and started getting sick 2 days before christmas. I probably got it from work (Amazon). I was going to get the booster on the 26th before I got it. 1st day started with a cough and sore throat. 2nd day my nose started getting congested also. 3rd day I woke up and had to lay down after trying to get out of bed. I had a fever, chills, stuffy nose, cough, body aches, nausea, other stomach problems. Was able to get a test on the 29th and it was positive. I still have my sense of smell/taste. I still have the body aches, and i am always tired. I also have a dry cough that is not going away. I had to use my emergency inhalor for the first time in a few months. All in all I could be alot worse so I am lucky. My oxygen levels have not been going under 98%. If anything the most annoying part right now is the non productive cough that causes the center of my chest to be sore and that I am always tired. I will probably get some muccinex to try to help with that. 

I have been avoiding covid since the lockdown started 2 years ago. I did pretty good lasting 2 years in a state that does not take Covid seriously.(#2)I have 2 shots + 1 booster and I am fucking dying bro. I‚Äôm currently waiting in the ER to get some medication bc I don‚Äôt have a nebulizar. It‚Äôs been about 2 weeks since I got it but I feel like it‚Äôs ramping up right now. Not feeling good whatsoever.(#3)They say symbicort reduces hospilizaton by 80% and that was with the original stain of covid. There was underrepresentation of asmatics in the hospital for that reason or so it was reported. Its good to have around if you can get a prescription.(#4)Double vaxxed, got omicron and symptoms on the 28th. Honestly, I thought I would have more trouble with omicron because I have asthma, but I only used my puffer once (2 puffs) because I felt an attack coming in. Other than that, my breathing has otherwise been unaffected.(#5)I got Omicron in early December, and the initial 10 day period wasn't too bad, as it jut felt like a cold. Once I shifted it, I started getting very wheezy, and felt like I was struggling to breathe, which left me exhausted. I also still have a dry cough, and sporadic chest tightness, but inhalers have helped. In short, omicron aggravated my asthma.(#6)Double vaxxed but no booster, also had flu vaccination this year.  Symptoms started 27/28 December, I'm more or less back to normal now.  Might have had omicron (no testing (easily) available in the UK for several days). Sore throat, mild headache, slight temperature, some sinus pressure, wheezing on deep exhale.

I could feel my system fighting something off (so it could have been omicron, it could have been flu; it didn't feel like a cold).

Used one dose of Ventolin per day on the two worst days, other than that I've been fine.

Worst thing is I had my booster booked for next week but I will have to reschedule.

Second worst thing, I think I've now had covid-19, but I don't have positive test to prove it.

Edited for clarity.(#7)double vaxxed and got it over the Xmas break. None of my symptoms had an impact on my asthma/chest. I was exhausted for a couple of days, had an upset stomach for 1 day and a sore throat for 3 days. The sore throat was absolutely awful. My wife was just tired for 3 days and was fine. If you're vaccinated you *should* be ok, asthma or not.(#8)I‚Äôm vaccinated + boosted and it genuinely felt like a nasty-ish cold. Congestion was pretty bad, but compared to getting it before vaccines were available, this one was an absolute breeze. I did have some shortness of breath, but not for long and nothing a rescue inhaler didn‚Äôt fix.

I wrote down every symptom in my notes if you want a more day-by-day type of thing(#9)I have it right now. Tested positive Monday, first symptoms Sunday. I'm fully vaxed plus boosted. I got it from work, at my hospital. 

So far it feels like a pretty bad cold. I have some chest tightness and a sort of wet cough that's only expectorating white or clear mucus (so, not pus or infection, just mucus). Weirdly, I felt almost okay yesterday, but now I'm up at 6am and I feel the worst I've felt since getting sick. Still no fever though.(#10)Had it over Christmas.  Honestly not much issue.  

Very blocked up which made it harder to breathe but was better after a day or two.  Once I could do some exercise felt a lot better.(#11)It was a little rougher to breathe and the mucus was pretty intense but I was only sick for like 3 days and I got over it really fast and my lungs went back to normal. If you have asthma I would 100% recommend getting the vaccine.(#12)I‚Äôm on day 6 rn. First day was brutal. Fever, body aches chills lower back pain and a brutal headache. 2nd day the same. 3rd day chest congestion that made me use my inhaler once or twice. I‚Äôm on day 6 and I feel fine just minor chest congestion and a bit fatigued. Stay safe everyone and yes I‚Äôm vaccinated(#13)Not sure if I have omicron but I have covid and I've been absolutely fine(#14)Honestly, it was fine. Slightly stuffed up. I've been boosted since Nov though.(#15)I just finished my bout w/ omicron and my asthma was for sure affected. My blood oxygen levels were good but the chest tightness was unreal and I couldn‚Äôt sleep on my back. Days 3-5 were the worst for me and I had to get on the nebulizer which has helped the most. This mostly dry cough (which only sometimes is wet) has been driving me nuts though.(#16)Asthmatic here‚Äîfully vaccinated, and currently riding the omicron pony. Feels like a bad sinus infection. Weird thing is, it started a week ago with an asthma attack and a constant cycle of burning lungs and a dry cough. That got better, then a fever, body aches, and a stiff head showed up. I got tested yesterday. So far, asthma symptoms continue to improve, but the blocked sinuses are horrible.(#17)Vaxxed and boosted and flu shot. Been sick since before Christmas. Home tests say negative, medical tests are unavailable. Mostly it‚Äôs in my sinuses and I am exhausted all the time. Slowly feeling better.(#18)got it a few days ago

Day 1 Sudden symptoms early morning runny nose light fever extreme cold feeling pain everywhere, couldn't get out of bed

Day 2 all symtoms day 1 gone Very slight sick feeling cold feeling when i breathe

Day 3 still slight sick feeling, wierd feeling when I breathe not heavy and goes mostly away with inhalers

Day 4 (now) same lung feeling but barely noticable only taking inhalers at this point

&#x200B;

I call the lung feeling wierd cuz it's not like the usual astma difficulty breathing, it's dry. At most I feel some chest pressure. The cold feeling feels like mint, but lower in troat. I don't think I have difficulty breathing, I feel \*something\* though but today it's mostly gone.(#19)I'm day 3 into covid, I'm fully vaccinated and a severe asthmatic. From yesterday I feel like I'm a week into a bad chest infection, my asthma is definitely affected and I'm coughing up so much thick phlegm (graphic I know!) 
 has anyone documented their recovery? Wishing you all well(#20)Fun (not) and still sick.(#21)I tested negative on 12/28 before I left to fly home but tested positive the night of the 12/29 after waiting in line for a test. That was a Wednesday and didn't feel anything at all until that Friday night. Just felt that weird feeling before you get the flu, like your body is not right and uncomfortable. Never got body sores or fever, just stiff from laying around all day. By Sat morning my nose was dripping and felt congested. I would feel a slight headache from my sinus pressure but over it lasted about a day and a half. The whole thing didn't seem to effect my asthma at all and the congestion wasn't any worse than my cat I'm allergic to sleeping on my head over night. It wasn't until about 2 weeks later that my asthma been flaring up. Working out is rough, my heart rate is higher from it. At work while I'm in my KN95 for 12-15 hrs I feel like I'm struggling to breathe. If I have to run around quickly I'm winded. A few times even without the mask I hear myself starting to wheeze. My inhaler is a small amount of help but not much. Wondering if I should contact my doctor soon. I have an O2 monitor being delivered today so I'll monitor that."
Has anyone else been prescribed Glycopyrronium bromide for asthma? All I find is info for COPD.,2,1.0,1,"(#1)What you have a long acting anti-mucinorgenic inhaler (LAMA), which in the last few years has been used as an add on to help keep asthma control. Unfortunately many place and many general physicians haven‚Äôt got the memo quite yet.

You can look up the 2021 GINA guidelines, see page 54. https://ginasthma.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GINA-Main-Report-2021-V2-WMS.pdf"

How do you manage asthma in cold weather?,3,1.0,3,"(#1)Where a scarf over your face outdoors and make sure to stay hydrated indoors.(#2)I'm not that bothered by the cold unless I'm doing something particularly intensive (summer is much worse for me because of the humidity where I'm at), but I like [this balaclava](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091CC1OG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to help keep my face warm. A thermos of coffee or tea when I'm out also helps a lot - it both keeps me warm and keeps my airways open.(#3)I‚Äôm finding wearing my mask helps a lot. And or my merino neck gaiter - it deals with the moisture better. Basically warming the air more and keeping the moisture in - it‚Äôs generally the cold and dry air that triggers my asthma.

For really cold days if I‚Äôm going for a while, I will take ventolin (albuterol for you US folks), before I go out."
Is it ok to use Symbicort and Pulmicort inhaler (ics) together?,0,0.5,9,"(#1)This is a question for your doctor or pharmacist, not anonymous people on reddit.(#2)This is not something that should be done without a doctor's order. Yes sometimes a combo inhaler will be used along with an ICS-only inhaler, but they do not contain the same drugs. And they are only done when someone's asthma is VERY out of control.

If you are sick and have a flare up, you should be put on oral steroids first. Adding a second ICS is *not* a typical part of an action plan; it's the last resort essentially.(#3)If it helps, I take Symbicort and Flovent daily (so similar but different) my asthma is classified as severe. I agree that you should talk to your doctor."
Mask for running in cold weather?,5,0.86,2,"(#1)Wear a mask or buff like cross country skiers use.(#2)I have [this balaclava](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091CC1OG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and I was really impressed with it's ability to keep my nose and mouth (and the air going in) warm without making me feel like I was suffocating.

Is it possible to have an asthma attack without any (major) symptoms?,12,1.0,18,"(#1)I have both anxiety and asthma, so I absolutely understand the weird gray area where the two sensations overlap. If your rescue inhaler didn‚Äôt seem to do anything, I would guess this feeling was related to your anxiety. I would try some deep breathing exercises where you count your breaths - there are many guides options online and through phone apps! It sounds silly, but it really does help in the moment to get you through. There are other breathing and grounding exercises you can do, you can do a quick google search and find one that feels comfortable for you. 

Like another commenter said, rescue inhalers can also increase feelings of anxiety. It can increase your heart rate and give you that kind of tight, panicky feeling. Do your best to make sure you‚Äôre inhaling as much of your rescue as possible rather than having it sit in your mouth. Sorry if this seems like basic info, but I went through something similar when I first was diagnosed with asthma!(#2)OMG! I‚Äôm in the exact position you are. Yes- you‚Äôre absolutely allowed to go to the ER for something like that. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve been to the ER more than I times i could count.(#3)I'd say if your reliever isn't helping it is more likely to be anxiety related.(#4)I‚Äôve been to the ER twice this month for asthma. I didn‚Äôt really have much coughing or wheezing, but it felt like it took 10 breaths to get the oxygen that one breath should‚Äôve gotten me. My doctor told me ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt finish a sentence without taking a breath, you should go to the ER.‚Äù(#5)Well I don't have anxiety disorder or panic problems and recently had very disturbing attack. Had no wheeze or cough, but my chest was extremely tight and for a few moments I wasn't sure if it was heart attack or asthma attack. I measured my blood pressure and then took some salbutamol and after few minutes I was better.

So yeah. Asthma can be silent and deadly. But if your rescue isn't doing much then probably it's something different. Still if you're worried go to E R.(#6)Yes. Just chest tightness(#7)It's anxiety if the rescue doesn't do anything. The thing you need to be careful of with rescue inhalers are they can make anxiety worse because a rescue is a stimulant.(#8)you can have a bit of a flare up for sure ! also if your anxiety gets bad it can effect your asthma . This has happened to me . also more you think about it worse the asthma can get .(#9)I have anxiety and asthma, and this sounds like how anxiety feels to me sometimes.

I would try doing grounding/meditation (whatever you're working on to reduce your anxiety symptoms) before going in.(#10)Yes yes yes. I went into the er 2 nights ago for this, & it turns out I wasn‚Äôt crazy. My oxygen was low(#11)Are you using a spacer with the inhaler? I had difficulty using my inhaler correctly at first without one."
Can someone tell me if this might be asthma?,0,0.5,1,"(#1)It's possible it could be.  I spent 40 years being diagnosed with bronchitis or pneumonia several times a year. Found out by chance that it was actually asthma when I was sick and had an appt for something else with my allergist.  He asked why I never told him I had asthma, I told him it was probably bronchitis again and I was going to Urgent Care after my appt (I nearly passed out walking to his office from the parking lot).  He did a few tests and gave me a neb treatment and inhaler and I was 90% better I left his office."
Do dry throats ever cause shortness of breath,2,0.63,1,(#1)Dry throats can be irritating to anyone.
Flare up with a cold. What do you do?,5,1.0,11,"(#1)Get it out. Leaving it creates a great environment for bacteria, which can lead to a secondary bacterial infection. Use your neb when your docs says to; if they say every 4 hours, use it every 4 hours. 

Make sure you don't overdose on acetaminophen though.(#2)Your current protocol is good. The only other thing I would add is glutathione support. NAC if you can find it, otherwise reduced glutathione and liposomal glutathione. Also drink tons of water to thin out the phlegm.(#3)Recently my asthma has flared up due to allergies and the wheezing has lead me to use my nebulizer ever morning and night‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt do it every 4 hours but I am very consistent with using it every morning and night and no matter what I try to GET IT OUT!! I also started drinking this tea called mullein and it‚Äôs really good for the respiratory system. Hope this helps!(#4)Twice daily hot showers work well for me after a cold - it loosens everything and makes it easier to cough up ‚ò∫Ô∏è(#5)I use vapor rub as well. Help with cough and chest pain.(#6)I am dealing with basically the same situation you are dealing with. I cough as much as I can up but I get to the point in coughing where im out of breath, and my chest hurts so obviously then I stop until I can comfortably cough again. One of my family members (big family) got a sore throat for a day. I was having coughing fits for a week, then finally went in and got on Flovent yesterday and am still coughing but not as bad.(#7)Add some hot showers and Neti pot treatments if you haven‚Äôt! Otherwise you are on the right track. Make sure to keep in touch with your doctor if you aren‚Äôt improving though as they can prescribe other medicines to help you out.(#8)Add some hot showers and Neti pot treatments if you haven‚Äôt! Otherwise you are on the right track. Make sure to keep in touch with your doctor if you aren‚Äôt improving though as they can prescribe other medicines to help you out.(#9)I feel your pain. I have ""viral induced asthma"" my doc said. It can flare up occasionally from excessive dust or allergies, but I can count on one hand when I've needed to use my inhaler this past year. However, just the most common of mildest colds and I'm on the Neb!

My hubs catches a cold and it's mostly in his sinuses. He gives it to me and it goes straight to my chest!  Nebulizer, mucinex, NeilMed sinus rinses and sometimes need Advair or something similar. I HATE prednizone... I mean I've taken it, but I try to avoid it. It makes me really squirrely, hard to get sleep and sometimes I end up hyperventilating while on it.  My latest cold my doctor prescribed a cough medicine called Benzonatate. I was concerned it would suppress my cough in a bad way, like keeping the phlegm suppressed in my chest, but she said it wouldn't and I can still cough if I need to, but it calms the irritant type cough or something. Anyway, I've been using it at night and it's helping and I don't feel any ill effect. It also makes me a little bit drowsy so it helps with getting rest.  Good luck! Keep those tubes open!"
Need some help im being ignored by doctors,1,0.56,17,"(#1)You need to get him in to see a pediatric pulmologist.

THis is going to sound gross, but can you store up a day's worth of phlegm to show the volume he's producing?(#2)No one takes autistic patiants seriously sorry(#3)I am not sure if you can but it might be better to go to an asthma allergy specialist?  I was having similar problems and nothing helped.  My inhalers made it worse.  Asthma doctor told me to go to a pulmonologist....    

my regular doctor really didn‚Äôt help and made me feel bad several times...(#4)If laying down causes the problem, perhaps it‚Äôs a GERD problem. Sometimes the acid reflux makes asthma worse and sometimes it‚Äôs not asthma at all - just phlegm forming as a result of the acid. Given all the antibiotics it‚Äôs not impossible that he‚Äôs got gastrointestinal issues. I would talk to someone about that idea. Also Galviscon is pretty good for gerd and OTC - maybe try that to see if it helps at all.(#5)I got over a chest infection recently and that sounds about right. Asthmatics produce more mucus than normal so it could honestly just be that. Make sure to get it checked tho but personally I‚Äôm coughing crap up literally all the time nonstop! I honestly don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs safe for kids, but if mine gets obnoxious I‚Äôll just take a mucinex.(#6)He should be retested for CF, and mention other conditions like PCD, I had similar symptoms but it‚Äôs so rare that it took a decade for someone to do the genetic test.(#7)Taking video and photos of production can help convince doctors sometimes(#8)My 15 year old has been hospitalized twice in the past month for severe asthma flares. She is not coughing up much mucus/phlegm. The pulmonologist warned me that she wants to start the CF work up at the next visit. It‚Äôs possible to have ‚Äúatypical‚Äù CF. From the amount of mucus that he coughing up‚Ä¶.he definitely needs the CF work up. Try to find a pulmonologist that is connected with a major medical center.(#9)Update:

So my son is aspirating into his lungs which is where all the phleghm is coming from we have a reassessment from the speech team for his dysphagia coming up after his school salt said this was not OK and did some digging for us. So he will be moving down a level on his dysphagia diet and ill update what the video swallow study shows this month . Thanks for everything all your info and suggestions where so helpful ."
Epi twice in one week? Any thoughts?,7,1.0,11,"(#1)If you‚Äôre getting these reactions immediately after the allergy shot, then yeah it sounds like you need a lower dosage of allergy immunotherapy for a while to help you get used to it. If it‚Äôs delayed, it could be something else.(#2)You may need to stop the allergy shots or get a much lower dose. Your allergist should actually be suggesting this to you after having two reactions.(#3)I had to stop my allergy shots completely because once I got close to the max dose, it triggered a bad exacerbation. And then when I tried to start back up again, it would trigger asthma attacks (the warning sign we missed before the exacerbation).(#4)I'm assuming they have you following certain procedures before your dose? Like taking a Zyrtec, a pepcid, a Singulair, and making sure you have eaten?"
Side effects from Singulair,21,1.0,43,"(#1)I‚Äôve been on it for 15 years and I‚Äôve had no issues, only complaint is when I run out, I can feel it in my breathing. But I wasn‚Äôt aware of the dreams, I ALWAYS have very lucid and vivid dreams(#2)i've been on singulair for 3 years and now have no side effects at all but it took me like a month to get to this point.  I'd try giving it at least a month.(#3)[This article](https://www.livonlabs.com/blog/medications-that-deplete-magnesium/) explains why it might be. It doesn't mention Singulair specifically, but the full name is Montelukast *Sodium*, an electrolyte which in excess, can cause [magnesium deficiency and its symptoms](https://dailyhealthpost.com/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms/). Supplementing with a [bioavailable](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29679349/) form of magnesium (malate/glycinate/taurate) should remedy the issue.  

Malate is good for energy availability, glycinate works best for anxiety-related issues and taurate helps regulate heart rhythm however any of these would help.(#4)I was one of the unfortunate ones with bad singulair effects. Worked awesome for my breathing but I felt out of my body, brain fog and couldn‚Äôt sleep even if I took it in the morning. 

Even half dose was doing it to me. So I eventually stopped because I was going to have a mental breakdown eventually. Too bad because my lungs were great on it. 

But a lot of people are just fine on it. Luck of the draw I guess.(#5)These posts always amaze me. I've been taking Singulair since it came out and I've never had any of these symptoms. Sorry to hear you folks having them.(#6)Yep. Had dreams about shit I never wanted to think about again, worked great but not even close to worth side effects.(#7)I had the worst nightmares and sleep paralysis on that. I thought I was dying in my sleep. I kept dreaming I was being suffocated by a demon.. and then I was stuck between dream state and trying to wake up and I couldn't.  Never took them again. Worst side effect from medication I have ever had.(#8)i had the same thing, but i started taking it in the morning and i‚Äôm all good. i‚Äôm only taking it as needed right now.(#9)Singulair gave me horrible side effects especially tremors that were out of this world. I took it for only two weeks.(#10)Singular helped my lungs but really really fucked up my brain. It makes me feel crazy. Depressed, suicidal, irritable, and similar effects to what BPD is described as. I cannot do it  even if it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for my lungs.(#11)Same same I‚Äôve been on it for almost two weeks now and been having these exact side effects but had a hard time describing them(#12)I had those too, and stopped taking it. It‚Äôs in my list of medications I don‚Äôt take.

And these are some of the uncommon side effects. Sorry ..(#13)It gave me erectile dysfunction. Def not worth it, lol.(#14)I‚Äôm debating talking to my dr even tho I‚Äôve been taking it 15+ years and works great for breathing. Starting to wonder if I could be better from a mental health standpoint but I‚Äôm terrified to go off it

Since I‚Äôve been on it so long I‚Äôm not even sure what ‚Äúnormal ‚Äú‚Äù would look like(#15)The first time I took it I had horrible night terrors where I'd wake up screaming. Years later I on the the generic formula and so far I don't have any nightmares. Try going to a different pharmacy and getting it from a different manufacturer.(#16)Yep my son was like a new person he could play again without ventolin ectbbut the side effects where awful he saw things from his dreams in his room while awake he would stare and tell me to look up it was frightening ,hd became sad and talked about very dark things which he had never before and was very violent with me he had to be taken off it which is truly awful as his asthma has become so much worse and it really was a wonder drug but the side effects especially as he has quite severe autism where frightening took me a month or so to see glimmers of his old personality again and the experience will always stay with me.(#17)No brain fog.  Instead it made me ragey and homicidal.(#18)Yep exactly why i needed to go on singulair as well ! Even with a preventer i still needed my rescue a lot , with me i believe i remember some side effects but then they subsided , i contacted my dr , and if they persisted i think something else would be done(#19)this is from the FDA, talk to your doctor asap. 

FDA requires Boxed Warning about serious mental health side effects for asthma and allergy drug montelukast (Singulair); advises restricting use for allergic rhinitis

Have you tried Accolate? Also a Leukotriene modulator but twice per day and has a generally different side effect profile. Curious how it would interact for you, ask your Dr. about it.

That would always clear me up tho waking up to using that machine is a PITA. 

Coffee in the morning also helps clear up small amounts of lingering wheezing for me personally as well(#3)Try sleeping alone, drink enough.(#4)Tons of water, Mucinex has helped me (I have a lot of post nasal drip), Flonase, humidifier,hot teas with honey m, neti pot, a hot, steam shower helps a lot (cold is my trigger, not humidity). Deep breathing exercises. And of course, the nebulizer.(#5)my partner has this same issue and we've still got no answer. It's the worst way to start the day"
Adult-Onset Asthma and App Advice,2,1.0,6,(#1)I have a sensor on my ventolin to track when I use it. It‚Äôs called propeller. It‚Äôs very useful and it allows you to track triggers/symptoms. Tracks the weather and allows you to add preventative medicines also like steroids and allergy meds. I purchased it through the Walgreens app.(#2)You might want to look into GERD/silent reflux‚Äîapparently a common trigger in adult-onset asthma
20 year old adult onset asthmatic.,4,1.0,11,"(#1)I heard symbicort works amazing . you should try looking into that(#2)Hello, my spirometry test were also fine, but struggling with constant cough and phlegm. Do you have cough/phlegm?(#3)From what I understand you can have a decent spirometry test and still suffer from asthma. That‚Äôs why some pulmonologists also apply the metacholine challenge(#4)Could be axiety if your tests are all normal."
Do you take Dulera?,3,0.81,8,"(#1)I‚Äôve been taking it for years- if it‚Äôs discontinued I‚Äôm in serious trouble! I last refilled it in mid October. Sometimes when I refill it they don‚Äôt have it on hand and have to order it(#2)A couple months ago, there was a supply issue with dulera and I had trouble getting my prescription filled. I haven‚Äôt heard that it‚Äôs being discontinued, though. That would be horrible!(#3)Update: I asked my sister in law who‚Äôs a pharmacist and she hasn‚Äôt heard that it was discontinued(#4)Definitely not discontinued.  Pharmacies are having trouble finding and keeping people that are smart.(#5)I just picked mine up so nope! I do always have issues with it being out of stock and it‚Äôs apparently not the most common med so they may have to special order.(#6)Biden induced supply chain issues"
I can‚Äôt tell if I have Exercise Induced Asthma or if I‚Äôm just out of shape and I‚Äôm too scared to ask,2,1.0,7,"(#1)I was afraid to ask my doctor too. But I just did it. For several years I noticed that as i worked out and was doing cardio I would breathe heavily to the point where my throat would burn. Lasted hours afterward. After sitting in a room for 2 years- pandemic experience- I wanted to get back in shape. I knew about my cardio issues and it was holding me back from my fitness goals. I gathered my convictions and just asked my doctor about it as I did some research on EIA. She prescribed me an inhaler. I use it before workouts and the difference is night and day. I still get out of breath but it is not painful and debilitating anymore. I can push thru the workout and it is pretty miraculous. I am also looking into if I have a deviated septum- another thing I have been wondering about and might affect my breathing. Good luck.(#2)Weather you do or not exercise induced asthma can go away . Unlike regular asthma . lose weight and exercise within a few years the ‚Äú asthma ‚Äú will be gone(#3)Fellow runner here and asthmatic.

You're trying to run faster than your current fitness level allows. Running is not sprinting and at your current weight, hard running is something you should avoid to avoid injury. The run portion of C25K should be just barely faster than the walk portion."
4 puffs morning and night better than 2,2,0.67,2,(#1)Sounds like this is a question for your doctor.(#2)Get an asthma review and a new asthma action plan
"Didn't have asthma, now it won't go away",11,1.0,48,"(#1)Ignore the response saying it's lung cancer. I can't even begin to say all the things that are wrong with that response.  I am still undergoing the diagnostic journey for my shortness of breath, where asthma meds do not help.  My advice is to be persistent with your doctor(s) in finding an answer.(#2)I would not take these symptoms as lung cancer.  I would ask for a high resolution CT scan for your lungs just to rule out any possible issues.  I would also get tested for allergies.  Myself and several friends have had similar issues as yours after covid and I've done everything you have - multiple x rays, pulmonary function tests, etc.  Ive had 3 doctors give me 3 different diagnosis - ranging from allergies to asthma to GERD.  

So far Nexium has been doing wonders along with Mucinex when I have excess mucus.  I would also maybe see if you have a heart condition.  It's also possible you have allergies/GERD which are causing you to have asthma symptoms.  Wish you all the best and don't give up.(#3)You need spirometry testing to confirm asthma, your doctor‚Äôs basically throwing a piece of cheese at the wall and hoping it will stick right now.

For now, you need to rest. Your lungs are clearly struggling right now, and need you to take care of them. I got diagnosed with severe asthma around the same time as you for the exact same reason. Our running, very strong theory is that I had Covid back before they would test for it if you hadn‚Äôt been out of the country within the previous 2 weeks. It fucked up my lungs but good for over a year, but when I got the vaccine back in March of this year my breathing massively improved. Now I only need to take an inhaler puff every now and again.(#4)Go to an ent and get your vocal cords looked at. Also, might see if you have gerd and test vitamins (vitamin d). Could also try anxiety meds and therapy as well.(#5)Why no spiro? In my country that's standard before I even get to see my pulmonologist.(#6)Might be a generic question, but are you on any medication and it may be a side effect??? I‚Äôm curious to know what you find out I hope you get to feeling better soon!!(#7)This is exactly, what i experience. It also started at the beginning of the pandemic. I am so desperate at this point, that i think im just gonna die in the next few years (although im only 22)... I have used different inhalers, immunotherapy, allergy meds, ventolin - nothing works. Im just coughing phlegm every day. Its only good when i am asleep.. I also never had asthma in my life before...(#8)I‚Äôm in a very similar situation. I‚Äôm about to give up, and it feels like the doctors are too. I have confirmed asthma since childhood, which has spiraled out of control for the past 6 months. 

I‚Äôve been having phlegm in my chest every day for several months now. Like you, I feel it pop/shift when I inhale, and the breath goes on. I spend the first couple of hours after I wake up coughing up phlegm. I can hear and feel a bubbly/gurgling sound when I inhale and exhale. I‚Äôve done an x ray and a sputum sample, both clear. When they listen to my lungs, they hear a lot of weird sounds, and put it all down to phlegm. I‚Äôm maxed out on all my asthma meds, and it has helped on the chest tightness and the wheezing. However, the cough and phlegm is still there. They have now put me on a decongestant, and it‚Äôs not stopping the mucus production, so not really helping. All the doctors I‚Äôve seen have been really nice, and they try to help, but they just don‚Äôt know how. 

I‚Äôve never smoked, and I‚Äôm in my early 30s as well, so COPD and chronic bronchitis is not probable. I tried allergy meds. Did nothing. GERD unlikely. That leaves asthma, or bronchiectasis. Out of the two, I‚Äôll take asthma. Just need to find a way to treat it.(#9)have your symptoms persisted?(#10)Lung cancer(#11)Sounds like anxiety to me"
Taken inhaler 3 times in 24 hrs,4,0.83,15,"(#1)If you're using it more than once every four hours then you might need assistance. If you're using it more than twice a week you need to speak to your doctor soon. Do you have an Asthma Action Plan?(#2)Check with your GP/Specialist. I take mine up to 16 puffs per half hour while waiting for the ambo, interspersed with ipratropium.(#3)My doctor told me recently up to eight puffs a day is possible (although you should definitely see your doctor if you need it that much since you may need to up your maintenance meds then).(#4)It should say on your inhaler. Mine says 2 puffs every four hours up to a max of 8 puffs a day. 

However, in a true emergency situation there is a larger cap, but really you should be making a doctors appointment if you need more than a day.(#5)I‚Äôve been using it at least 6x a day for the past year and a half(#6)I use it 4x a day(#7)If you‚Äôre using it more than 2-3 times a week, it‚Äôs a sign your asthma is uncontrolled and you need adjustments to your asthma treatment (like adding a control inhaler). However, if you‚Äôre currently seeing your doctor, the most you can take rescue inhalers and nebulizers in terms of ‚Äúdanger‚Äù levels is once every 4 hours. So you aren‚Äôt going to die or anything, but you DEFINITELY need to see your doctor because your asthma is out of control."
I don't wheeze,20,0.96,38,"(#1)I don't wheeze. Even during bad asthma attacks I don't wheeze. It gets harder and harder to breathe. I cough or choke. 

However my attacks are relieved by albuterol. You should visit your pulmonologist if you're having attacks that aren't relieved by a rescue inhaler. It could be another issue like LPR or vocal cord dysfunction(#2)Are you regularly seeing a pulmonologist about your asthma? 

While not wheezing isn't uncommon, experiencing asthma attacks that don't seem to be relieved with your rescue inhaler might mean something else is going on.(#3)I didn‚Äôt realize that doctors are so focused on wheezing until my most recent ER visit (3 weeks ago). He was being quite an ass, not taking me seriously when I calmly explained, repeatedly, that ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt breathe‚Äô.

He tried to make me feel ashamed that I may need some expensive testing and tried to send me home. Then he asked, almost mockingly ‚Äôwell, are you wheezing‚Äô. I said I didn‚Äôt know. He begrudgingly stood up and started listening with his stethoscope‚Ä¶.. ‚ÄúOH, OH‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre REALLLYYY wheezy!!!‚Äù

Only then did he decide that I needed every teat they had.

Can only imagine what you deal with if you don‚Äôt have a wheeze to accompany your asthma attack.(#4)I very rarely ever wheeze. I've kinda learned if I'm wheezing it's pretty bad at that point.(#5)Yes, OP, I do. I also have good O2 stats and used to have decent lung capacity so I could speak even when I was struggling (COVID knocked that down by 25% permanently though). I used to have to be almost rude before I‚Äôd get a breathing treatment at the hospital. Without fail, the doctor would come back in and day ‚Äúwow! You really WERE struggling!‚Äù 

My heart rate jumps when I‚Äôm having an attack. It‚Äôs how my doctor of nearly 20 years can tell how bad things are. I have a nebulizer at home now with the same stuff they use at the ED and have worked a plan with my doctor so I can do treatments at home. It‚Äôs too much added stress to be there gasping for breath after being told you‚Äôre fine when you know you‚Äôre not.(#6)I nearly had a doc kill me because I wasn‚Äôt wheezing.
Seriously.
I kept going to my family doctor over a period of a year, with 2 complaints. My asthma felt awful and my upper back and neck were completely seized up.
She would listen to my lungs for half a second, and say‚Ä¶
NO WHEEZING, NO ASTHMA 
WE JUST NEED TO FIX YOUR BACK
She convinced me to do physical therapy, Tens unit. Did nothing 
Meanwhile, I was having dreams that I was dying by being strangled.
Waking up literally clawing at my neck.
She kept saying it was all in my head.
Convinced me I was just stressed out from work (I loved my job, actually)
She sent me to pain management, where they put me on MORPHINE (yes, you read that correctly) for the severe muscle spasms in my neck and upper back. (Including the FRONT of my neck) 
Pain management and the family doc told me I had to stop working. I cried. But I was so desperate‚Ä¶ I quit.
Meanwhile, I went to an ENT for my out of control sinuses, and he put me on a prednisone burst. I noticed that the 5,000 ton tank on my chest lost a little bit of weight. Then I realized that this wasn‚Äôt in my head. (I had weaned myself off of the morphine by this point. My doctor was treating me like garbage for being on it. I just took it every other day, then stopped getting refills) 

So by myself, I found an allergy/asthma doctor. The first day I saw him,  he said, let‚Äôs have a listen to your lungs, all right?
I‚Äôll never forget the look on that man‚Äôs face. He backed up and said, ‚ÄúI said take a deep breath. ‚Äú I replied, ‚Äú I did. That‚Äôs as deep a breath as I can take.‚Äù 
That poor man went white as a sheet.
YOU NEED PREDNISONE AND YOU NEED IT RIGHT NOW!!!
I replied, ‚ÄúIn the interest of full disclosure, the ENT just gave me some. I finished it‚Äù
He went more pale.
THIS IS AFTER A ROUND OF PREDNISONE??? YOU NEED MORE! AND YOU NEED IT IMMEDIATELY!‚Äù
That man saved my life. 
I‚Äôve been on prednisone in various amounts amounts since then. It‚Äôs been somewhere in the neighborhood of 18 years. Minimum of 10 mg per day. Now with the advent of Dupixant, they are going to finally start weaning me off!

That asthma doc almost had a heart attack when I told him that they put me on morphine. His jaw dropped and he said, you realize that you could have died in your sleep, right?

The muscle spasms were because my lungs were so impaired, my body was using every ancillary muscle possible to assist me to breathe. I was close to respiratory failure.(#7)it's beyond the wheeze. ""you have to be able to move air to wheeze""

doctors, and all their years of education, and all that money.... \*sighs\*(#8)I rarely wheeze either. Mine is more tightness and heavy chest. Every time I go to the dr for it, they say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre lungs sound fine‚Äù it‚Äôs annoying. I‚Äôd see an allergist and pulmonologist if you haven‚Äôt already.(#9)I dont get a wheeze. My asthma is simular. It took three doctors for one to finally say to me that my asthma was back. We tried a few different preventers till last year she put me on seretide. I swear the rescue inhaler never worked for me ( i took prednisolone to help me at the time) finally setetide has helped now when I take my rescue inhaler it actually works.(#10)I don‚Äôt wheeze during my attacks.  It‚Äôs called ‚Äúrestrictive asthma ‚Äú   After I use my nebulizer it will open my lungs up and then the lung sounds will be present.  Crackle and wheezing only after.(#11)Me neither. I am sick right now and my peak flow is down 25%, and I'm not wheezing.(#12)I don't wheeze unless it gets really bad. I don't hardly cough either. Usually it's just a tightening and uncomfortable feeling.(#13)Yes. Me. 

I rarely wheeze, even as a kid. That‚Äôs probably why I just got diagnosed officially a few years ago. I‚Äôm 40F and I only took things seriously last year. 

I was always tired as a kid but my family thought it was because I was chubby. I couldn‚Äôt play as much as the other kids and I couldn‚Äôt do sports. It got worse in high school. I was always sick every two to three months and it would last for weeks. Then when I went to college, I was sick every single month. By then, I lost the weight but I went to college in a city so I assumed it was the traffic. It never got better. 

I took things seriously last year (yeah, I know) because my boss got upset about it and then I was put on montenuclast and I got better like 80%. I was 100% better with high dose oral steroids but I can‚Äôt be on it forever. I‚Äôm going to see my pulmonologist now because I want to be 100% better.(#14)Wow. I thought I was the only one.(#15)Do you know what kind of asthma you were diagnosed with ? id get reevaluated so when you get sick again and need to go to the ER you can tell the drs the information . they shouldnt dismiss you and not take you seriously .(#16)Not everyone has the same symptoms. I don't usually wheeze except cold air. But it's more like I can take a deep breath or something... It happened a month ago.(#17)I don‚Äôt wheeze and so I thought I was fine, my doctor told me otherwise and diagnosed me with asthma. It feels like I‚Äôm breathing through a straw most of the time and sometimes I just don‚Äôt breathe. Strange because my brain reacts and forces me to breathe ‚Ä¶don‚Äôt know if that makes sense.(#18)You should check if you have GERD. I randomly struggled to breathe and rescue inhaler did not help. Turns out it was GERD causing chest pain that felt EXACTLY like an asthma attack. I‚Äôm on pantoprazole now and no longer have this problem. GERD is very common.(#19)Are you on any preventer? Before I was put on one every asthma attack or shortness of breath would cause me to wheeze but after using a preventer, I barely have any wheezing. Agreed some doctors don‚Äôt take you serious if there‚Äôs no wheezing(#20)I hardly ever wheeze either and have the same problem of not being taken seriously. I really wish doctors were more familiar with atypical presentations that are not ""textbook-perfect"" ... Add to that the facts that my max lung capacity is way higher than it ""should"" be for someone my height and weight (I'm at about 140% of what the ""ideal"" would be), that my lung function test when untriggered looks normal (and most doctors only compare to the ""ideal"" capacity when they don't know you so even if I only got 105% (which is \~75% of my personal max), they would still think my lung function was ""great""...), and that my peak flow hardly ever drops significantly (while on steroid maintenance, it usually dropped to about \~90% of my max during an attack/problems while I was normally sitting at comfy 95-98%, but measuring it during an attack often causes chest pain, as if my whole chest muscles had to work really hard to force the breath out).

I was officially diagnosed not once but TWICE by different pulmos (the first time as a teenager after he had me trigger my exercise-induced asthma, the second time a few years ago via methacoline challenge test after the new pulmo didn't believe me when I said I have diagnosed asthma). I have most or all of the other typical symptoms during attacks (chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath, laboured breathing, air hunger, used to have bad coughing but that's gotten rare under steroid treatment), and most importantly, my symptoms as well as my peak flow react positively to my rescue inhaler.(#21)I have extensive family history of asthma. My mother has had the same problem with doctors dismissing her because she didn't wheeze. One tried to tell her she didn't have asthma.

I am on a preventer but also know now from experience that if I get a cold I have to take Prednisone as well. Keeps me out of hospital...

I did a saline challenge test once and dropped 20% lung function without making a sound. Then after I had some inhaler I started to wheeze a little.(#22)I can and have wheezed; however, most of my attacks do not include wheezing. (Only time I‚Äôve wheezed I had pneumonia with my asthma). Your asthma is STILL painful and real, even without wheezing. I see an asthma, allergy, and immunologist and he‚Äôs my saving grace in terms of being someone who took my almost never wheezing asthma seriously. General practitioners just sometimes don‚Äôt know what to look for with asthma. My minimal wheezing asthma is partly why my diagnosis was later than it‚Äôs should have been.(#23)Yes. I have many doctors who have done the same thing to me. Explore these possibilities:

1. Your mucus is so hard that you‚Äôre not coughing it up. You should be put on prednisone and an antibiotic to fight this. Maybe even start taking allergy medications. 

2. I was diagnosed with pertussis, mono AND mycoplasma pneumonia by a naturopathic doctor. They do not tend to test for these things at your family doctor. Either ask your doctor for this blood work, or find another doctor! 

3. Anxiety, unfortunately, will make the breathing problems worse. 

I used to think that the shortness of breathe was ‚Äújust asthma‚Äù and that it‚Äôs something I have to live with. Not anymore, it‚Äôs just that your current doctor is not trying to be a detective in your symptoms. If they don‚Äôt take it seriously, find another doctor. It‚Äôs not just asthma, I promise. If it were asthma, it would just be a wheeze and your emergency inhaler would help it immediately."
Dull short intermittent right chest ache,4,0.83,3,(#1)Lungs don't have much in the way of pain receptors. This sounds like something to discuss with your doctor.(#2)Does exercise make it worse? How old are you? The muscles of your chest cross from your sternum to your underarm so I would say it's most likely muscle pain.
Smoking on asthma?,5,0.73,35,"(#1)There is no solution to making smoking and asthma be ok. You‚Äôre only going to put yourself at a higher risk of a flare up or an attack. Take it as a sign to quit smoking while you‚Äôre young, it‚Äôs not worth it.(#2)Don‚Äôt smoke(#3) I actually have asthmatic allergy to Cigarette Smoke, period, and have lost consciousness in closed area with secondhand smoke!(#4)Although it hasn't been confirmed by a doctor, I'm pretty sure that smoking in my teens contributed to triggering my asthma, in combination to living in a moldy appartement. I quit since my asthma diagnose 1 1/2 years ago, and with time my asthma has become pretty manageable. But exposed to cigarette smoke it instantly triggers an attack. Just not worth it!(#5)Yeah. Used to be a smoker. After developing asthma smoking is just not possible anymore. I will have three bad asthma days after one fag and it‚Äôs not worth it. Thankfully it made it really easy to quit. I was almost done smoking before the asthma set on anyway though and was already only a casual smoker by then. My asthma stems from mite allergies though, not Covid. So no idea how Covid could play into this.(#6)I also smoke, it‚Äôs not a good idea but it‚Äôs manageable for the moment. Long term probably it will get worse. If you‚Äôre 16 yo it‚Äôs easy for you to quit now. Better try now. Also it‚Äôs well known that montelukast/singulair could be related to depression, I think they actually have a warning on the box in some countries(#7)Do not smoke. It‚Äôs one of the worst things you can do to your body. You‚Äôre young so quit now before you do some serious damage. If you‚Äôre struggling try nicotine gum or a vape. Ideally quit cold Turkey.(#8)It's stupid to smoke especially where you're still a kid.(#9)Please do not smoke. It does awful damage to your body and there's simply no way in which cigarettes and asthma can co-exist without severe attacks

You're young, it's a lot easier to give up now than later. The best time to give up was yesterday, the next best time is today(#10)Check into the montelukast.. it has some wicked side effects. I had to come off of it.(#11)honestly nobody else here is gonna like this buh i have pretty bad asthma like most of us here but i smoke weed n vape still w no issues. thats not saying YOU will be okay. buh ik im okay(#12)I‚Äôve never smoked and I wouldn‚Äôt DREAM of it with my asthma. But my asthma has put me in the ER twice this month for absolutely no reason and sometimes that just happens to people.

I guess all I can tell you is this; every time you want a cigarette, ask yourself ‚Äúis this cigarette worth a potential flare and possibly a trip to the ER?‚Äù

Because sometimes even if you do everything right, sometimes your asthma screws you anyways. 

(Sorry I am in a mood today, my battery is dead in my key fob and my lock froze, so my family had to rescue me. My big dumb stupid self got locked out of my car in the snow. üòí)(#13)You really need to ask this???(#14)very bad idea 

i kept getting flares until i quit smoking

it got much better since then 

i was dx with asthma may 2020 and been suffering all year until i finally quit(#15)Typically when you stop smoking there can be a rebound in negative symptoms because your body is trying to heal. 

It's obvious smoking doesn't help your situation so it would obviously be unwise to smoke.(#16)It will feel like you cant breathe, and also you will not be able to run much. I hate the fact that cravings kick in when i do understand that the quality of my life depends on quitting smoking. I fucking hate how smoking made me a bitch of a habit.(#17)Born with asthma,
Been controlling it with salmeterol and fluticasone inhaler, once a day, keeps my asthma completely in check. 
Only problem is I have more mucus phlegm than a normal person. 

Contrary to the moral angle - smoking is bad for you,etc

Smoking marijuana actually helped with my asthma in my teens ( I quit 8 years ago at 25 since I just outgrew it) and look I'm not a doctor, just sharing my experience. 

I still smoke cigarettes though,  and in my experience, it makes zero difference compared to a non asthmatic.
I've taken breaks from the smoking for upto 1-2 years, and honestly no difference at all with the asthmatic. 

Disclaimer - I know smoking is bad for the general population and does some damage to almost all people in the long term and I'm not disputing that in anyway.

Edit- I havn't had an attack in more than 20 years(#18)Why would you smoke after covid tho ? ah yes the bipolar . good luck man . btw dont throw your asthma meds during a mood episode thought id throw that in there cause no sane person would smoke AFTER COVID"
( Question ),7,0.9,7,"(#1)Hey! I (19F) have had asthma since I was a kid, and have been off and on medication for my whole life. I currently take a med called Singulair, a very common prescription for asthma, that specifically triggers allergens that make asthma worse. It does some other things too. But the point is, whenever I forget to take that medication or run out of it, my day is so annoying because of my lungs. A lot of the time, our bodies change more than we think as we grow. Maybe talk to a doctor, or go to an allergist to do some testing, or talk about what may be causing this. Do you live in an area with cold air right now? Or somewhere with a lot of plants?(#2)You should see your doctor about it. If it's asthma, your doctor can give you a daily inhaler that helps prevent attacks. Sometimes other very treatable conditions (like GERD/acid reflux) can cause asthma-like symptoms as well."
Can you just deal with an asthma attack?,15,0.94,16,"(#1)you need to get yourself checked out by a doctor, not treating your asthma is going to cause a lot of damage to your lungs(#2)We all deal with them until we can‚Äôt. One day you will have a way worse attack and will regret not getting a system in place to address it.(#3)Sounds like you should go to a doctor.(#4)Yeah you can. i do it on a day-to-day basis.

I  have mild-moderate asthma so i get little short time attacks every now and then (when i cough, laugh etc).  


Also yes, you should definitely go to your docter. ignoring attacks without medication  is not good and can affect your airways.(#5)I have just dealt with asthma attacks quite a few times because I didn't realize I had asthma at the time. You should see a doctor and you should absolutely get a rescue inhaler in case you can't handle an attack.(#6)It's not healthy to ignore asthma, and without any rescue medication (at a bare minimum) you could have a scary attack in which you would have no choice but to go to the hospital.

Talk to your doctor and get an albuterol inhaler at the bare minimum. It could do you wonders!(#7)Yeah, you should see a doctor. Not being able to talk is a sign of a severe asthma attack that means you need the hospital so that wasn't good. People do manage to get themselves through asthma attacks...until that one time they don't. Asthma attacks can kill you - even if you haven't got severe asthma, it only takes one bad attack. And the more out of control your asthma is, the more likely this is to happen.

Your other symptoms - cold air making your chest feel tight, prolonged coughs after a cold could certainly indicate asthma. Seeing a doctor and getting it under control with some medication, could not only stop you from dying, it could really improve your quality of life (it's amazing being able to breathe properly! And not having to deal with an endless cough every time you get a cold!).(#8)You seriously need to talk to ur dr to get ur asthma under control, asthma can be deadly. My mom's older brother had a really bad asthma attack then died in his sleep that same night(4yrs before i was born). And even years after i was born(up until i moved out when i was 20) my mom would sneak in my room while i was sleeping to see if i was still breathing cause she's afraid ima end up like her brother(#9)My roomate had an asthma attack 3 years go, she was crawling outside for air before I noticed and called 911. After 2 weeks in the hospital and many tests later the doctors said ""she might be allergic to dust"". Came to find out it was most likely covid induced. Even her doctor now says its possible she caught covid before the outbreak but who knows. We do know she doesnt smoke, is athletic, doesnt have any food or animal allergies and isnt allergic to dust. I also read about people who got psychological induced asthma due to stress. I would goto a doctor and get a professional opinion. If they dont find a physical reason try getting a psychological opinion.  I'm not saying you are but some people can be suppressing some things that can cause stress without them knowing and its your body's way of telling you ' Hey go get checked out by a professional and speak to someone' . Hope you find the cause and get better asthma sucks.(#10)That's extremely dangerous. You at least need a rescue inhaler. Asthma can kill.(#11)can i stop you and ask why you feel you should suffer? you are worthy of treatment, asthma or not.(#12)I beg you to get it checked out. Asthma is a big deal. The only reason I‚Äôm on this subreddit right now is bc I just lost my bf to asthma. He died suddenly at the age of 31 to an asthma attack. I would give anything to go back in time. I feel an immense amount of guilt for not doing more. Please get checked out and have a plan, if not for you then for your loved ones.(#13)I used to ‚Äúdeal with it‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt realize the pain of asthma was not normal. Trust me, medicines help. Go to the doctor ASAP and make sure they take your symptoms seriously!"

Asthma isn't exclusively caused by viral illnesses, though a viral illness will be found everywhere that there are people or other vectors (carriers) to spread it. Moving would be the very last measure I would recommend in order to offset Asthma - it is completely changing your way of life and locale, the most extreme form of coping with it. Addressing allergens, triggers and establishing Asthma control are the best treatment. 

Is this a presumed Asthma or a confirmed diagnosis? Not all breathing difficulties are Asthma, and not all that wheezes is Asthma. There are a handful conditions that mimic what Asthma is typically felt like or might appear to be - a few of those are gastric in nature.(#2)Maybe try and get an air filter or a few before anything else, and if that helps moving might help, too.(#3)I was just reading about the ‚Äúasthma belts‚Äù yesterday. I will say I moved to an asthma belt city and noticeably worsened. So the reverse seems logical. High altitude, cold dry environments like CO, ID, MT seem to be ideal. Others would be TX AZ, NM but southern states have a high prevalence of toxic mold indoors because of the difference in temperature from the outside and inside due to air conditioning. You really need to lower your relative humidity to below 40% especially in the crawl space.(#4)when I moved back to new england my allergies and asthma became uncontrollable. 

kind of the opposite of what you're asking lol(#5)My asthma improved when I moved from FL to WA, because I removed a lot of stress from my life. 

IMHO I don't think it works as good as other lifestyle changes. If you have the kind of money where you can just pick up and move to a warmer climate without causing financial stress to the family, it might help. But if it's going to be a big deal to move, I wouldn't .(#6)Sometimes it isn't just moving away from allergens, but making sure you avoid parts of cities where things can be more troublesome.

For example, a ton of brake dust exposure from living close to major highways can be really bad as it goes deep into lungs. You could still live where your career/family/friends are, but in a part of the city with less exposure.

Keep in mind that it does help to get some small exposure to allergens from trees, grass, etc. You can't completely avoid everything, but just like immunology shots for asthma and allergies, a little bit for the body to work on prevents big reactions over time.(#7)I moved to the deep south because the cold is the main trigger for my asthma. It also helps to be able to open my windows most of the year.

It really did work! I only use my rescue a few times a week when I am exercising. I also haven't gotten a cold since I moved here. It really depends on what other triggers she has. I have heard that some people move to Arizona because of asthma just to find out that the dust makes it worse. Or here mold and mildew might be a huge trigger that is everywhere(#8)I'm from AZ and have heard that in the old days before modern asthma meds, folks would move down here to get relief because dry air tends to be better for asthmatics than humid air. I'm not sure if dry is that great, but things like mold can certainly make asthma worse and mold grows very easily in humid places, so maybe that's the reason. Pollution and air quality can also play a role, so it is ideal to live in a place with decent air quality if you're asthmatic.(#9)I moved from WA -> CA more than 3 years ago and my asthma has improved significantly. But I also started actually taking daily allergy medications and a daily maintenece inhaler in that time as well.(#10)Maybe if kiddo has allergies that irritate it?(#11)35 life long asthma sufferer here. I live in the Pittsburgh region. There are active Mills still in the area. We have a very high Asthma rate compared to the rest of the country. When I go on vacation to the ocean, I see major symptom relief. The best was when I went to the Dominican republic. I was drinking and with that comes cig smoking and still didn't need my inhaler. I think the area and the air quality makes a major difference.  However, indoor pollution is a major factor and if you move and don't change your indoor environment, nothing will change.  Both of my parents smoked in the house had dogs and cats which were terrible for asthma. I suffered a lot as a child.  I hope you do not subject your child to any of these which seem torturous to a child with asthma.(#12)I moved from street with lots of diesel vans passing to a country village with little through traffic. It took a long time to work out diesel fumes were my main trigger."
[Asthma Treatments],4,0.83,5,"(#1)Biologics are pretty strong. 

In terms of inhalers it depends on the dose and steroid type. In terms of the treatment ladder if you're on a combination inhaler then you're typically higher up the ladder. LAMA Add-on medications also indicate that you're higher up the treatment ladder. Other Add-ons like Theophylline and Montelukast indicate you're higher up the ladder etc. Oral steroids are stronger than inhaled steroids.

Asthma care is pretty complicated. The above is a very brief overview and not in depth at all. Generally speaking though long-term oral steroids, biologics and bronchial thermoplasties are the strongest treatments.(#2)You need to look into Dupixent or Xolair. Also Singular. These meds actually treat the underlying cause of asthma. Instead of just treating the symptoms with inhalers.(#3)Nebulizer treatments are usually more effective than their dry powder inhaler equivalents (e.g. albuterol). 

Steroids (oral or injected) are also helpful in the short term for acute flareups"
What happend?,2,0.67,1,"(#1)I have noticed a decreased ability to breathe when I take a break from the gym, even if it is just 2-3 days so yeah, very likely!"
I was doing so well. What happened?,8,1.0,17,"(#1)Sometimes asthma just decides to wreck you. It's a terrible disease. Hang in there, and don't hesitate to reach out for a follow up with your docs if you don't see any improvement in a couple of days.(#2)Yeah I've had this same level of persistent tightness since my 2nd pfizer dose. I took up running 3 miles every other day and that seems to keep it at bay. Advair/albuterol don't help and bronchiodialators give me headaches so I guess I'm just a runner now lol(#3)Have you been using an antihistamine as well? Typically the worst Asthma exacerbations can be caused by unknown allergens or triggers, but cold air and exercise are very common triggers due to the stress they place on the airways themselves. Emotional state can equally be a trigger, as the release of stress factors in the blood makes airways and breathing a little trickier too.(#4)* UPDATE *

It mostly resolved on its own yesterday. Just a touch now, for only small parts of the day. My Whoop strap confirmed that my respiratory rate and average pulse during sleep was higher during the symptomatic period, when I look at the time series. I guess I'll never know at this point, and my pulmo doc said the same. I'll be doing some more advanced immunological blood work with him to fine tune things, and soon will go from Trelegy down to Breo as originally planned.

So grateful this is resolving, but I'm still glowering at that COVID booster, even though I can't prove anything. The timing and lack of other significant variables is just too suspicious to ignore(#5)I‚Äôm also on Trelegy and was very much enjoying it but then I got a cold right before Christmas (negative pcr for covid) which lasted 6 days. Ever since December 30th, I‚Äôve had some mild chest tightness/shortness of breath that comes and goes that I can‚Äôt quite shake off. Trelegy doesn‚Äôt seem to be hitting the spot since that started. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs keeping the chest tightness mild and at bay but I‚Äôm not feeling the same amount of satisfaction and relief as I‚Äôm used to. 

So sounds like we‚Äôre in a similar boat. I‚Äôm still optimistic that it‚Äôs just remnants of my cold but I told myself if it doesn‚Äôt get better by the end of the month, then I‚Äôm going to make an appointment with my current allergy doctor. 

Since this seems less environmental/allergy related like it has always been, I may start thinking about getting a referral for a pulmonologist.(#6)Where you just had the booster, don't worry about. I felt awful for about 4 days after my booster."
"Redditors with GERD related asthma, ¬øWhat are your symptoms and how do you cope?",9,1.0,4,"(#1)The sputum is being caused by inflammation in your esophagus creeping up into you throat.

I am currently dealing with a GERD flare up after pushing a no-motorized bed half bent over rushing a patient to the CCU on Thursday. I am already on Dexliant, which my insurance is stopping coverage of on Jan 1. I had been doing so well, had been feeling great for many months, and now I'm back to this. 

Lots of phlegm and throat clearing. Pain in my esophagus, some coughing from the mucus creeping down into my lungs. Have used albuterol a couple times to clear shit out and it does make me feel better.

I had been doing so well, too. I was drinking coffee and eating whatever I wanted and not worrying about the general rules for GERD. I was hopeful that even though I was going to have to go back on omeprazole (max dose), I'd be fine because I'd been symptom-free for so long. 

And then Thursday happened, and it had nothing to do with the food I'd eaten. The patient was in respiratory distress and overweight. The head of their bed was up very high, and I'm short so I had to put the bed at the lowest setting to be able to see. And that meant I had to push the bed while leaning over, and by the end of that 5 minute physical activity (it really is a workout!), I knew my GERD was going to fuck with me. 

I'm now off coffee again, eating small and easily-digestible meals, nothing spicy, nothing within 4 hours of bed time, and I'm taking Gavascon Advance after every meal and before bed. Still struggling, but I think in a week I'll be feeling a lot better 

And NOW I am considering fixing my hiatal hernia. There's no reason pushing a patient bed should wreck me like this. :((#2)The general recommendations for GERD:

* allow 3-4 hours between eating and bedtime

* sleep with head/shoulders slightly elevated

* consult with doc whether a 2 week course of a PPI is indicated."
Question about EIA,3,1.0,8,"(#1)Cold air could be a factor.

My symptoms can be set off after less than a minute of exercise, depending on what I'm doing, what pollutants/allergens are in the air, what the weather's like (not just temperature, but also pressure and humidity), etc. I've only very rarely had periods where I can exercise for several minutes without an attack, and it's typically only low impact exercise like kayaking or cycling.

My doctor told me if I feel like I'm using my inhaler ""too frequently"" (for example, if I exercise every day and have to use it every time I exercise), I should talk to her about it. There are options for maintenance meds that you take every day to minimize symptoms.(#2)It really depends on how good shape you‚Äôre in, and how hard you‚Äôre running. Like sprinting for 100 yards/meters would definitely set off my exercise asthma, and that is well under a minute.  

I use my inhaler before exercise.(#3)Sounds like your EIA may have progressed to regular asthma. You may need to go on a controller med.

Also, when it's cold wear a buff over your face to prewarm the air.(#4)My lungs will wreck me if I so much as jog 20 m to catch a bus so yes, small amounts of exercise (especially running to catch something) can absolutely trigger it."
Sleep induced asthma?!,12,0.88,10,"(#1)I think that has something to do with cortisol being too low during night time. Our controller meds mimics the behavior of cortisol and keeps us running.(#2)Respiratory Therapist here.
Asthma difficulties can manifest at night due to the body's shuffling of different inflammatory factors during sleep, but one of the largest ones is the cholinergic cascade that occurs during rest when the airways relax. It might be time to discuss adding an anticholinergic medication to your Asthma regimen. Inhaled anticholinergics prevent the body from relaxing the airways too much during rest, preventing shortness of breath associated with that relaxation. They are typically used in COPD, but Asthma that is worsening can become COPD, in addition to four other conditions.(#3)It can also be things like GERD/LPR.

If you are using your controller as directed, you really should not be having flares at night.(#4)Are there foods that also inhibit the production?(#5)I always assumed that's just how asthma is and that's why the controller is usually taken at night and in the morning... also you're asleep and you might not notice right away."
"Idk if this is mental but every family gathering or any gathering that is, i need my albuterol. Its like the other people are taking my air. I start using it and feel bloated and uncomfortable. Am I the only one? It sucks",17,0.95,30,"(#1)Sounds like anxiety, which is a medical condition for which some people need medication. Don't discount the seriousness because it is ""mental."" Chemical disorders in the brain are just as real as other physical disorders like asthma in the lungs. Both are important, real, and should be treated. Just like asthma where there are a variety of treatments that work from breathing exercises to medicines, there are different approaches to treating anxiety. For some, medicine is required and for others, coping skills and therapy can be helpful.(#2)Someone said anxiety, but could it be perfume setting of your asthma?(#3)EVERYTIME! I get the same way. Today though I went to my moms bathroom. Refreshed my face, braided my hair, took my in hailer, brushed my teeth. And went back downstairs. I felt much better getting away for a while, cooling down, and re centering. I think it is anxiety on some levels. And maybe the food.(#4)Perfumes for me, took a total break from others at lockdown to find out! 

30 years of not realizing or knowing why I would get a dread feeling or asthma after being around a lot of people for a while.(#5)Perfumes, deodorants and hairspray all annoy me.(#6)Anxiety, stress, but also allergens that may be present at other people's houses, or perfumes. All affects my asthma, I just increase my inhaler use.(#7)It could be an asthma trigger or anxiety. It's really common for people with asthma and other breathing issues to have anxiety---for obvious reasons! Run it past your doc. They will likely want to narrow down if it's asthma related. And then if that's ruled out, you can tackle any other issues. I have both asthma and anxiety. With time I've been able to understand what is what and if I need asthma support or to use tools I learned in therapy. Good luck!(#8)Yea it happened to me as well. Typically allergens like cats and dogs and perfumes can cause it for me(#9)Man , i have had these symptoms my friend !! definitely anxiety ! Hang in there(#10)I have the same thing when getting into my car. Partially, it can be anxiety. BUT make sure that where you are, there is no dust or dirt!(#11)me too.(#12)my asthma and my anxiety go hand in hand(#13)Not anxiety. Multiple people walking through a rug kicks up all the allergens.(#14)You‚Äôre not alone. I have Eosinophilic asthma. And lately it‚Äôs either do a nebulizer treatment or eat something but I can only choose one. A meal with my family or breathing.  My anxiety plays a huge role in my asthma. I have found working on your anxiety helps some! Best of luck to you!(#15)Definitely run this by your doctor, but I often find that anxiety triggers an asthma attack for me. It's never been super bad for me, but my doctor had some solutions that have helped me. Good luck!"
Rescue inhaler,8,1.0,5,"(#1)Yes. Hey, Merry Christmas and check this fun fact out. So I went to the ER a year ago because my inhaler stopped working. It's normal. So according to my doctor sometimes certain receptors stop processing the medication like they used to. So I got put on a new medication and now it works. Sometimes it happens, don't freak out. Talk to your doctor and let them know. They are so many options for rescue inhalers and controller inhalers. Find one that works for you!

To add on to this... If your inhaler is not working go to an ER or call 911! Be safe and do what you have to!(#2)Double-check the expiration date. Sometimes I‚Äôve had mine stop working even a few months *before* the expiration.(#3)im on airomir , ventolin never worked ü§£"
"Had asthma when i was younger, went away until now, 18 brought on by a chest infection. Chest infection is gone but still struggling.",8,0.91,14,"(#1)It sounds like you may still have flare up. It takes me roughly two and a half months to recover from a cold because of my asthma. Your two inhalers are likely one to control over the long term and one rescue inhaler. I have asthma where a lot of things that didn't used to bother me trigger it. It's hard. If you're taking all your medication regularly and still feel like crap, definitely ask to see a pulmonologist. They can explain more and modify meds and do more testing. Also, getting a nebulizer at home and having your doc prescribe meds to put in it can really help. There are cheap nebulizers out there. If you do have severe asthma, you should have a nebulizer at home. It can save trips to the ER and urgent care. 

I find asthma.net to have helpful articles. Good luck!(#2)It sounds like your doctor should have you on a round of oral prednisone to calm the flare.

You most likely do not have severe asthma where you are on a steroid only inhaler. You may also temporarily need a combo inhaler instead of just a steroid inhaler.(#3)Is the brown inhaler the Clenil Modulite? Are you in the UK?(#4)Same with me. My asthma went away and then came back with Covid. Just getting over a chest infection now. My inhalers were not enough to help. Go to your doctor and discuss prednisone and nebulizer. These 2 things have really helped me with my flare."
Tezspire Approved: FDA approves maintenance treatment for severe asthma,28,1.0,9,"(#1)Will be curious to see how this drug interacts with people over the next couple years.(#2)I‚Äôve been waiting for this to be approved for months!!(#3)I wonder why it‚Äôs only for severe asthma and can‚Äôt be used for mild to moderate? I‚Äôd love to try this but my asthma is pretty controlled by my inhaler(#4)Looks very similar to Dupixent, Nucala, and Fasenra. All are biologically used to treat asthma. I‚Äôm on Dupixent but am finding some of the side affects intolerable. Interested to see how Tezspire stacks up.(#5)I'm on Dupixent even though my eosinophils are not the problem.  I have really high IgE. Anyway, the better my breathing got the more generalized body pain I had. I can't wait to try this."
Where to put the better air purifier??,12,1.0,9,"(#1)I'd put the one with the higher CADR in the larger room.  The only other thing that might affect my decision is how quiet they are: I personally like a lot of white noise in my bedroom to block out noise from the outside world, but some people can't sleep with a purifier that's too loud.(#2)Do you have central air and heating?  If I had an awesome air purifier I'd try to line it up near the intake to help the house overall(#3)When and where do you experience the most asthma? That‚Äôs where I‚Äôd put it. Or move it as needed.(#4)I'd just buy more plants. They're a lot quieter."

The hospital is a shit show at the moment. I had to put my foot down during the second admission because respiratory wanted her on continuous albuterol and back in the ICU. We just wanted to go home and be safe from Covid! 
Sounds like you need steroids and possibly some antibiotics. Also something like high dose Pepcid for ulcer protection. The Pepcid also helps with the allergy symptoms.(#5)Warm tea, spicy food always works for me.(#6)Air purifier with a HEPA filter clear the air!! I have year round allergic asthma!!

Peak Flow Meter,35,0.9,31,"(#1)Loads of people improve their peak flow with new medications. Steroids can improve it over time. LABAs and SABAs can do more immediate improvements. It depends on you as an individual.(#2)I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing. They do testing in me at the office before and after treatment but I didn‚Äôt know there was something for home use. Amazon search here we go(#3)That's partly why I think the NP I've seen a couple of times (and am seeing in a couple of weeks) doesn't impress me that much.  (And yes, I'm considering trying someone else).  I've read 2 books by MD's on asthma, a bit dated but not much, really (probably more on meds than on treatments), and both talk about peak flow meters and asthma action plans.  The pulmonologist I've seen twice & his NP?  Nope on both.  So I bought my own peak flower meter a few months ago and use it twice a day.(#4)That‚Äôs me. 5‚Äô6 male. 

Anyone had a low reading that improved after trying new meds?(#5)Also, I think in order to know if you are properly using the peak flow, the reading should be consistent/close every time. I might just learned how to use it properly after a month(#6)Nice! I wish mine was this good again.(#7)Context?"

That said, the pill you‚Äôre thinking of is probably Primatene. 

Also, stop smoking.(#5)I smoke marijuana every day. I usually smoke and the morning and am fine after a cup of black coffee and a steamy shower. There is an over the counter asthma pill I can't find it online but I know it's a stimulant and is often sold with added caffeine. That stuff would make me so jittery I just stuck to my daily controller medication and an emergency inhaler.(#6)Don‚Äôt smoke cigarettes, but weed seems to make me breathe better!(#7)can you switch to an edible solution?"
Ruling out Fake Asthma,16,0.95,9,"(#1)I have this and have asthma. My morning symptoms (which also occur after naps) are caused by allergens in my bedroom and on my pillow. When they start getting worse, I clean my room, change my pillowcase, and do a deep clean on my retainers. Always makes my symptoms go away.(#2)If you see symptoms when laying down, you may have GERD/silent reflux. They can mimic asthma.(#3)Sounds like you might be allergic to dust/mites in your bedroom! I have a wicked dust and mite allergy. If everything isn‚Äôt enclosed in allergy free cases ( including mattresses and box spring) dusted and cleaned regularly, I wake up a train wreck. All linens washed in hot water to kill anything. (If you are laying down on a sofa, dust mites can be a problem there too!)(#4)What set me off is the laundry detergent used on my bedding. Even though I wore clothes washed in the same detergent, it was worse in the mornings. Until I switched. It took some trial and error, but I found something I don't react to. Obviously, unscented... there's a few I can use, and many I can't. Just to add that bedding issues aren't always dust mites.(#5)Usually if asthma is following a pattern like that, allergies are definitely something you need to look closely at. As some have mentioned, dust and the detergent of your sheets is a possibility. The other thing is feathers, either in a pillow or comforter. Also some times of foam bedding bother some people.(#6)Respiratory Therapist here..
Asthma is a variable condition related to triggers, exposure, frequency of inhaler usage and other factors. It is particular to the individual, but does follow the body's peaks and plateaus regarding histamine release as well as other inflammatory mediators. It is entirely possible that you may also have an eosinophilic form of Asthma, a newly recognized form that was previously only a concept and now has evidence and medications for it. Either way, the suggestions here are good, but I would start by asking your doctor for advice."
Symptoms persisting after oral steroids,10,0.92,20,"(#1)It could be that you need a stronger dose or a longer course. I normally need 40mg for atleast 1 to 2 weeks then be slowly taken off prednisone. It normally results in a month long course and fixes my issues. I will say though I do have uncontrolled asthma and because of my type of asthma there‚Äôs not many options for me. So prednisone is my only option when I have a flare. You could need a change in maintenance medication. I would contact the doctor and see what they say.(#2)Are you on a daily maintenance inhaler? Symbicort does wonders for me.

Edit. The ""blue'' inhaler sounds like it could be albuterol. There are plenty of steroid inhalers that will decrease your exacerbations. Also, if you have allergies, Montelukast is a good option for allergic asthma. It can have some side effects like insomnia, so I took mine in the mornings.(#3)I think you should go back to your doctor. There's more  medicine needed to achieve the asthma control.(#4)Go to your doctor and ask. It‚Äôs not uncommon that I‚Äôve had to repeat another dose of prednisone or even get a shot of it to really knock something out.(#5)Steroids don‚Äôt seem to work for me. Last time this happened to me and the steroid didn‚Äôt help, I called my doctor a couple days after they ran out, and they got me on a different daily controller inhaler.(#6)i would see about looking into changing controller medication .(#7)I‚Äôm going through it rn. Hope we make it(#8)Can I ask specifically what your symptoms are? I may be able to help you.(#9)This happens to me often. Doctors can increase Predisone dosages, change up steroid dosages, etc to help the flare up if first rounds don‚Äôt help. Definitely go back to the doctor!"

I also follow a regular exercise program which boosts my immune system.(#3)Lots of allergies but nothing too crazy(#4)Glad to hear that.. guess maybe didnt find answer to my problems(#5)>I am doing alot of reserach and found lots of evidence of asthma being the catalyst for getting colds more frequently.

Is it asthma that's the catalyst for getting more colds or does getting colds increase asthma symptoms?(#6)I get sick all the time. In the past 6 months I‚Äôve had 5 infections (rsv was one of them)(#7)I was sick often as a kid. Like 5+ times a year. Now it's maybe 1-3 times.(#8)Now I preface this by saying this is when I lived in China with heavy pollution; I would get bronchitis about every 2-3 months. In the 4 years that I‚Äôve lived back in the USA , I would say I get sick probably 9 x a year I think?!(#9)Pre-Covid - sick all the time (I work with books and kids, both of which are disgusting) . But, like low key sick. I only got SICK (i.e. flu, cold, strep) a few times a year. During Covid ...(#10)Before COVID approximately 3 times a year. Usually got the flu once every other year and 2-3 colds a year. Even common colds always exacerbate my asthma. Knock on wood, I haven't been sick since March, 2020.(#11)I have only gotten two upper respiratory infections in my entire adult life and besides Covid this past July/August, I never get colds and (knock on wood) i never get them when my toddler is sick coughing or blowing snot all over me.

Are you on Prednisolone? That can also cause BP increases, strangely hasn't done the same for me despite being on maintenance Prednisolone.(#2)i was prescribed breo but i never used it . i kept hearing about the side effects and stuff and wasnt keen on using it lol but i had an opportunity to look into something different so now the stuff im on now basically is just like advair but a steriod(#3)For what it's worth 140/90 isn't too bad at all.

I'm such a chicken I would not play with anaphylaxis. Also where is the shot given? After your symptoms it should be given in a hospital not a doctor's office.

What kind of premeds might prevent anaphylaxis I wonder?

the way the biologix meds work, as I understand it, is the IGE starts a cascade and eosiniphils are the consquence. so one treats the cause (xolair) one treats the consquence (fasenra and the like). same effect on my end imho.(#2)Ok so I have been getting xolair on and off for like 10 years or so. I never had issues in the past though the past couple I've had a little chest tightness. I still get it and the feeling usually goes away within an hour or so so I'm honestly not even sure it's a reaction and not just like anxisty.

That being said your reaction sounds WAY worse so I would definitely talk to your doctors. Have you considered a similar biologic such as Nucala or Fasenra? Both of those were also offered to me and it might be worth trying to see if you have a reaction to them before continuing xolair if you're having a reaction.(#3)I have MCAS. I was reacting like that every time I got xolair. I started taking 100 mg benadryl and 50 mg hydroxyzine an hour before the injection, and that helped.

I've had one fairly severe anaphylactic reaction several hours after xolair. It was this past July. I went home to sleep after the injection and woke up with my eyes swollen shut and one shoulder spasmed up to my ear and the asthma cough. It was very bad. I took prednisone and it started getting better about 45 minutes later. In hindsight I should have used epi, but I don't think clearly when having a really bad reaction. My doctor thought i should stay on it if possible. So far it's been ok.(#4)So they're trying to kill you then?(#5)I‚Äôve personally never had a reaction to my xolair (although have to other things and know how scary it can be), however I have given patients who have had allergic reactions to biologic medications the same medication again but with pre meds (antihistamine + steroid) and very careful supervision.  Some have reacted again, and were then switched, others were fine having it with the pre meds.  My advice is to talk to your doctor about your worries, let them explain their rationale, and reassure yourself as to what the best decision going forward is for you - whether that be seeing about a switch to a different biologic, or trying xolair with pre meds.(#6)Premedicating through IV is a real thing when necessary. But there are other biologics so why wouldn‚Äôt your doc just switch you over?"
I‚Äôm so screwed.,25,0.84,54,"(#1)You need to ask your doctor ASAP.  These questions are what they are for.(#2)Find a pulmonary dr now(#3)Ok, so I'm in a similar boat as you, accept my breathing troubles came on post rsv infection. I was blown off for the last three or so months and just 2 days ago found out I have patchy bilateral ground glass opacities in my lungs and I can't keep my o2 up unless I'm sitting still, as little as bending over drops it. Don't let yourself get to the point I'm at. Requesting a home nebulizer is an important first step, but you also really need to get in and be seen. Asap.(#4)Get an at home nebulizer and some of the vials for it. Wear a vest at work for additional warmth and always wear a scarf when you leave the house, don't just rely on a mask for warmth but properly encase your neck with a scarf too.

Yes, that's pretty bad blood pressure. I actually take beet juice for my blood pressure. An ounce or two every day. This can also be just eating one small beet every day, if you like them in vegetable or pickle or soup form. Hibiscus / red sorrel tea can also help with blood pressure. If you were hoping for a cheap, natural solution these two plants combined can reduce blood pressure by about 20%, dangerous if it's low. For you that would be almost 40 points lower, putting it at still high but less alarmingly bad.

Finally... heart symptoms can mimic asthma. Your blood pressure is bad. Your relief medication is causing you to have the effects I would expect from taking it when you don't need it. The steroids aren't working.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this is probably not your asthma, even if the symptoms feel very much like asthma. It sounds like you're having heart problems to me. One of the symptoms of a reaction to the vaccine is heart issues (inflammation, specifically). I experienced a lighter version of what you're describing for about a month after my second Moderna dose. It did get better. So if it's a vaccine reaction it will likely improve if you take it as easy as possible, it's just your body panicking as it learns to protect you. That said, I would seek out testing for your heart health if it does not improve after a couple more weeks. Tell a doctor what's wrong, not that it's your asthma getting worse, don't put them in a diagnostic box, but just what you're experiencing, they will be best able to help you. This is not something you should just sit on. But in the meantime it can't hurt to drink some red tea or start eating some beets to naturally help your blood pressure out.

The symptoms you're describing are pretty scary and if left unchecked could definitely cause damage or even death, so don't delay. A blood pressure of 190 over anything is scary and could cause you to have a heart attack or stroke. Last time I checked mine was like 130/90, you ideally want it to be around 120/90. If it's regularly high you may have to take a blood pressure medication which might help your breathing more than stronger steroids. This is because your 'breathing' is also your body's ability to absorb and move the oxygen you inhale into your lungs around your body in an efficient manner. If your blood pressure is too high, it isn't managing to do that. So even if your lung passages are clear you can feel fatigue and short of breath, because it is failing to distribute the oxygen in a timely fashion.

Hope you feel better soon and get the right medication to help you.(#5)Definitely ask your doctor and have him run some tests.

I feel like there‚Äôs two options here: a) it‚Äôs related to the vaccine, in which it will probably go away soon as your immune building phase starts to simmer down or b) it‚Äôs a coincidence. It could be inversion/air pollution or even just the weather changes. Most people weren‚Äôt getting their boosters until now, and right now the weather is changing, so I feel like we‚Äôll see those connections made between people more often.(#6)Did they check you for myocarditis or pericarditis when you went to the ER ?  Those side effects can mimic asthma and it is a documented side effect of the vaccine.  I would go back and get checked out.  Especially if you‚Äôre a younger male .(#7)When is the last time you scheduled an appointment with your regular doctor? The ER/Urgent Care is going to do the bare minimum to get you out the door especially with covid on the increase.(#8)You need an Asthma control regimen. It sounds like your Asthma is rather uncontrolled now and it's only going to get worse if you don't start one. 

Talk to your doctor. Steroids don't ""strengthen"" your lungs, they fend off the process of inflammation that makes your Asthma worse. Systemic steroids do reduce your immune system's ability to fight off illness though, so you need to be careful about that.(#9)Mine got really bad post RSV infection. Been recovering for 3 weeks. Blood pressure is typically 90/60 (I'm pretty fit) and it doubled like that. I went to my pulm and got a nebulizer. BP has stayed pretty steady since. 

If you're not already, you need to get a controller med and a neb.(#10)yes call your doctor . my asthma acted up the 2nd shot . im getting my booster in a few days and im scared lol . i had to call my doc also(#11)[deleted](#12)For myself I can say that nasacort sensimist says ""not for asthma"" yet for my allergy induced asthma it has worked wonders. I will start breathing better the same day i start using it!! It is a glucorticoid and steroids are commonly used also for asthma treatment. I inhale mine deeply which isn't exactly what the directions state but it works for me. I am not a doctor and cannot give you medical advice, this is solely what works for me and my allergy induced asthma. Please see another Doc ASAP also.(#13)Ask for a prescription of prednisone and a prescription of z pak, I use to get asthma like you a few months ago accept it would get me in my sleep, I‚Äôve accepted death from asthma many times, there were many times I‚Äôve thought it will not make it thru my treatment and I will die. But I can say keeping a very clean space and keeping a consistent room‚Äôs temperature will do the trick. I‚Äôve found Zyrtec to help apart from that I use advair daily in an inhaler form and strictly neb treatments and I‚Äôve gotten it under control for now. Mind you I have not gotten my vacation I am scared for my asthma because if it got worse than before I will for sure be dead(#14)Your high blood pressure can be caused by your albuterol, plus as others have already mentioned, heart problems can mimick asthma so you definitely need to get your heart checked thoroughly and ASAP, especially since the asthma treatment isn't working.(#15)telehealth?!(#16)there's a lot of comments on breathing and I don't have anything to add but I do want to say that I'd like to see your blood pressure addressed seriously. I'm surprised they let you got with that number.

also weird side note. after I got moderna I noticed a rattle on my left side that I couldn't cough out or nebulize away. Got a chest xray and have a pleural effusion. It's been there since last June when I got the 2nd dose. idk if it has anything to do with it but I never had a PE before and also never had a covid vaccine before.(#17)Wears mask to protect from cold."
Ventolin puffer having negative effect?,0,0.5,5,"(#1)yes! ventolin has never worked for me and i‚Äôve always felt that it made my asthma worse( i mean never like this) but i guess you understand. Why are they forcing salbutamol tho? I mean it‚Äôs a big red flag that his oxigen levels are dropping out. I am no doctor but there are alternatives like Metaproterenol Levalbuterol 
Pirbuterol or Terbutaline(#2)Respiratory Therapist here.

The wheezing that they're hearing is likely due to airways popping open that were previously closed down. However, if that is the case, a nebulized albuterol would be better utilized here because then the medication gradually acts instead being lost to closed lower airways and forcing more puffs into a less accepting lung. I will say the Ventolin being Q2 likely isn't helping at this point. If there is persistent lower airway closure, it may take breathing against pressure CPAP/RAM cannula to help pop those airways open.

Giving the medication Q2 is also more than likely causing it to work less due to overstimulation of the receptor sites responsible for the opening of airway smooth muscle."
DAE asthma attacks also cause panic attacks?,30,0.95,28,"(#1)Of course. Self calming skills are critical to we wheezy people.  Lots of approaches ‚Ä¶ find one that works for you.(#2)I've never had a panic attack, but my pediatrician used to warn me that if you panic during an asthma attack, you're likely to make it worse. 

Yes, nebulizer treatments can increase your heart rate. But don't mistake that for a panic attack. That's merely a chemical reaction, not an emotional one.(#3)Yes especially when I was younger, I'm kind of able to control it now(#4)They're best friends and neither likes to be left out.(#5)What solution are you using to nebulize? I switched from albuterol to xopenex and it has definitely helped with the heart rate. Everyone is different, but maybe it's worth the try if you have to nebulize often or an elevated heart rate makes you anxious? I also have panic and anxiety disorder and having an elevated heart rate already sets me up for anxiety, and it just never ends! Hope you feel better soon!(#6)Yeah. Not being able to breathe naturally brings on panic (it‚Äôs about survival, even perceived survival). And panic will aggravate the asthma. 

There are many techniques out there - some examples:
Breathing out very slowly through pursed lips

Reminding yourself that this is a part of you that is desperate to survive and isn‚Äôt based on facts or logic (deal with it like a kid having a meltdown - firm but kind). 

There are many others - orienting yourself to the here and now through your senses, etc. 

And they need to be practiced to work. Expect to fail and get back up the horse. Be patient with yourself. 

And if it goes too far ask for help.(#7)I was diagnosed with panic attacks before asthma diagnosis. So I have both. The fact that my asthma developed in adult hood made me have panic attacks because I thought I was dying. I learned driving around with the windows cracked a little bit helps me. It‚Äôs all about distraction in my opinion. My panic attacks used to be helped by a beta blocker but those aren‚Äôt good for people with asthma so now I can longer take them. I‚Äôm going to see a pulmonologist to be reassured my asthma is under control and also a psychiatrist to see if I can get something to help with anxiety or see if they can recommend a therapist to help me with my panic attacks. Find something to distract you. There is also a method to make you feel grounded where you name three things around you that you see, then three things you hear, then three things you can touch, you can also do three things you smell/taste. It hasn‚Äôt worked too well for me but maybe your different.(#8)I have migraines too.  So when one shows up, the other two like to join the party.

Like I need to use my inhaler to breathe, but then migraine aura makes it hard to see and I'm just trying to not puke everywhere.  
 If another goddamn  person tell me to drink water and try breathing exercises I'm going to throat punch them.(#9)It does sound like you might need some extra Asthma control starting to prevent those issues. You're right though, emotional instabilities can be a major trigger for an Asthma exacerbation - many sufferers think that environmental triggers are the only things to look out for but it's more complicated than that. Asthma is a way of life and it can take time to co-exist comfortably with.(#10)Oof I butchered that title. Sorry yall.(#11)[deleted](#12)Yes, I had the same problem. Get your anxiety controlled first (talk to your doctor)! Or your gonna have a bad time, anxiety that leads to asthma, which leads to more anxiety...(#13)Asthma attacks at least cause me more stress/anxiety for sure, and yeah, that can make things worse.  It's hard to do when you're in the middle of it, but I've read we should take some deep breaths (if possible, right?) when an attack is starting, try to relax, etc. - to maybe lessen the severity of it if we're lucky.(#14)Happened to me ‚Ä¶ my symptoms were like severe idk what happened then i panicked"
Helping almost 2 year old during asthma attack,4,0.84,23,"(#1)It never felt good, but my kid started using a spacer at around 18 months or so and was inconsistent about how he felt about it.  If he was distracted with toys, I could sneak it in, but sometimes if he was feeling cranky I'd have to out-octopus him to physically restrain him to get him to take his fluticasone and/or ventolin.  That didn't last, though- he just turned 4, and basically does his spacer by himself now (Under supervision, obviously).

We've never had to use a neb for him, thankfully, but I think the best tips are just typical parenting tips.  Do things consistently and in the same way every night, and looking at distractions/rewards to get it done.  I had asthma as a kid and had nebulizer treatments nightly from at least 4 until I was 8 or 9, and I really looked forward to it because it was a guaranteed 15-20 minutes of being able to play computer games without anyone bothering me.  2 might be a bit young, but maybe find a show (Or weird YouTube children's videos, whatever works) and make the nebulizer time time to watch that.

Good luck!  You'll get over the hump eventually, though the hump might be a year long.(#2)Would it be possible to paint the mask on the outside, like of a super hero or something? So sorry you are going through this.(#3)This sounds very stressful both for you and your toddler. It seems that you‚Äôre doing everything right by showing him that wearing the mask can be fun. If you haven‚Äôt already tried, my only suggestion would be to do this all while he‚Äôs NOT having an asthma attack and is in a good mood, as he likely associates the mask with something very stressful (his asthma attack). Good luck!(#4)We just had another ER situation for my 6 year old asthma exacerbation from a virus, RSV. We forced medicine onto him, and then a pcr test that I had to restrain him for...except he was exhausted and then vertigo from the stress and threw it all up (liquid steroid boost) on our way home. So i had to let him lay on the side of the road with his face on the ground, clinging to earth...It was that moment that I realized im still part of the issue. I knew this would happen when i had to restrain him for the test,  but I didnt know how to speak up or adjust. 

He wants autonomy. He tells me that he feels smothered by the medicine routine when we are sick. So as I'm learning. I'm giving short term options, do you want to use inhaler or get dressed first. Go choose a car to hold onto or wear his spiderman costume, or we can have juice before and after.. Yes there will be resistance at the medicine, but implementing some type of access to control the moment can help ease the process.

At our worst, we watched  videos on high volume to use our nebulizer. And this was at least once every two hours(severe symptoms that were being supervised by dr) 

At this age, they are just understanding that the medicine is not like putting on our socks for shoes.  Its putting on our seatbelt for the freeway,  or having a parachute for someone skydiving, landing gear for a plane. Im not saying to scare them, but build a story around supporting their imagination and the connection.

We have used pretend play, schedule times where we place the mask on his face and pretend by counting down, 3.2.1, and I make a sound effect like the machine. If you get that down, the next step would be to try breathing , pretend as if your going to do the medicine with the mask on and also doing this without any mask in the car or on a walk.

My son's emotions and screams from us trying to help him and him acting out on his own, have put us in danger zones, so as mom the warning gun blows but we have to stay calm , and know that when we stress, it carries over.  Countless times where i hear the playtime and even family take it too far. I sit waiting for 5 minutes before symptoms start... but I cant do much until everyone recognizes their part in the situation..(im a nurse so i appear too apprehensive,  when it's really common sense lol)

You are doing the best that you can. I have done everything you had mentioned, every child will be different and this will be easier as the concept is grasped. Sometimes it takes us being uncomfortable to realize mom is right and  she just wants us safe, they are blessed to not know anything other than ""mom controls everything "" lol. 

Your doing a great job.(#5)Respiratory Therapist here.

All of the strategies mentioned here are a good place to start. Play is vitally important to your toddler, so incorporating the use of the mask and managing Asthma into play time is a good way to remove the stigma associated. Teaching them that when they first start coughing or wheezing (sound association) is a good time to use the medicine can be incorporated into that play and should work quite well. Really familiarize them with the nebulizer and mask, normalizing its presence in the room and removing any stress it might bring.

As soon as you can (if you can) - practice using an inhaler with a spacer. Having something new and easy to use might help ease the transition to comfort.

Like all aspects of parenting, this will take time.
You're doing a great job so far, be proud.(#6)There‚Äôs actually a reliever you can take in a liquid form like how you take Calpol with a syringe!! It acts faster because its taken in a liquid form so it is consumed properly - obviously with asthma sometimes you don‚Äôt inhale the steroid properly especially when you‚Äôre highly distressed because you can‚Äôt inhale properly. It‚Äôs usually used for people who struggle to take the inhaled steroids, a lot of the time it isn‚Äôt mentioned to you as it‚Äôs a little more expensive. I was recommended this by someone in A&E he was a carer for disabled young people and this is how he administered salbutamol inhalers for him because he couldn‚Äôt inhale properly! Hope this helps(#7)Screen time. All the screen time he wants, as long as he‚Äôs sitting still for the nebulizer. It will get better - Kiddo is 4 and the only thing stopping him from giving himself his maintenance inhaler is that he‚Äôs not strong enough to pump it.(#8)We bought a tablet, something our son had never had before (and we‚Äôd never let him play with our phones or anything either, so it was completely new for him), that could only be used when the nebulizer mask was on.   He was nonverbal till 7‚Ä¶so getting the concept through to him was a bit difficult, so we would randomly, when he wasn‚Äôt having any issue, just put the mask on him and hand him the tablet, he got the concept in a couple weeks and it worked great.   Definitely wouldn‚Äôt work if it wasn‚Äôt a novelty though."
Do you exercise during a flare?,9,0.91,10,"(#1)Hey, relax... All in good time. If it makes you feel better I've been through this cycle too many times to count. Your health comes first. Once you get back into the swing of things with your fitness schedule you will thank yourself for giving your body the time off it needed to recover. Don't go crazy over it. It's a barrier in life we both have to deal with so we best learn how to co exist with asthma and realize that we need to rest!(#2)Don‚Äôt push yourself! Walk if you need, but heal first fitness second.(#3)It's ok to take a break, even though it is definitely frustrating. But - your body needs to heal and part of that means resting when necessary. Hang in there!(#4)When I'm in a long annoying flare I normally stick to walks, yoga and if I can handle an abs or squat work out I'll do a set or two! Feel better!(#5)So i ended up doing this , just mild exercise, it didnt make it ‚Äú worse ‚Äú but it made me cough more . i had a mild flare up so i didnt need to go to the hospital or nothing but for me it caused a lot of discomfort and stuff and more chest pain and wheezing(#6)Wait till you feel like you recovered from the bronchitis itself. In the same situation, If I feel decent I sometimes do some lighter exercises in an enviroment thats asthma safe = in a clean gym or at home for example. Also do exercises that do not challenge the lungs much. So definately skip cardio. Easy Weightlifting is pretty fine I would say.(#7)Respiratory Therapist here.

Try to get some light stretches and exercises in if you can, but don't push it. Your health comes first. If your energy level and other factors aren't coming around, there may be something else going on. Viral infections are great at trapping bacteria and spurring bacterial co-infections, get a check up soon if things don't seem right - that's what urgent care and your doctor are there for, to keep you ahead of what's going on."
Starting From Scratch - A New Blog Series,15,0.89,4,(#1)I took a look and the page looks nice :>(#2)I'll pass.
Diagnosing asthma,2,1.0,29,"(#1)You may have one of the many illnesses that mimic asthma like GERD, Vocal Cord Dysfunction, etc.(#2)In the same boat.  Did good on my tests, but still did better (number wise) on the second test after albuterol.  Despite this I don't feel too much better after using it.  I'm sure anxiety is a big part of it.(#3)My lung function tests are always good unless they specifically trigger my asthma first. Got it diagnosed twice by pulmos, though: the first time after triggering my exercise-induced asthma before the lung function test (he had me running around the block for lack of better options until I felt my lungs burning, then did the test), and the second time with a methacoline challenge test (by a pulmo who, after my normal first test, didn't even believe I had asthma but the challenge test was unambiguous).

So yes, you can still have asthma if the general lung function test comes back normal. They should do a methacoline challenge test next in order to really rule out asthma (and if that test too is normal aka rules out asthma, you should look into getting your heart checked, as well as checked for GERD, as those are things that can mimick asthma symptoms).(#4)It's less likely that you have Asthma than one of the other conditions that can contribute to feelings of Asthma-like symptoms. Normal spirometry can be present in mild Asthma as well, but because you had neglible improvement with a bronchodilator, it's much less likely that you have it right now.(#5)They can always do a methacoline challenge test. I had one years ago as part of a clinical trial. It will tell you one way or another. If you do have asthma, it‚Äôs pretty unpleasant."
Anyone have any experience with these nebulizers?,2,0.75,5,"(#1)I have one similar to that with a similar price and it‚Äôs been great. I like these mesh ones so much better than compressed air ones.(#2)I‚Äôve had, and discarded two different mesh nebulizers. One just stopped working, the other produced less and less mist over a few weeks. I kept them clean and used albuterol. YMMV. I‚Äôm back to using the motorized air pump type(#3)The Phillips Innospire is the best one of these we have ever used. And we have tried 3-4 different mesh nebulizers over the years. It‚Äôs very fast.(#4)The mesh ones are okay but break easily and have to be replaced. For nebulizers like this, the flyp works really well but is expensive. I use it now over anything else. You have to maintain it like instructions say to to keep it working well, but it‚Äôs awesome. https://flypnebulizer.com"
I'm a bit scared over Omicron,60,0.89,58,"(#1)[deleted](#2)Start doing some research about covid and asthma.  There's a lot of studies out there that show having asthma is not a risk factor and even some data showing controlled asthma may even lower your risk.  Im not saying disregard everything but there is data out there to show it.(#3)I was equally as scared, being inhaled steroid dependent and also on a biologic (Dupixent). I had Covid HELL, 12 days of 104ish fever, pericarditis, four weeks out of work, and eventually pneumonia. I received the antibody treatment on day 4. This was in August, and I‚Äôm just now able to exercise again.

With that being said, I had every symptom there was EXCEPT breathing symptoms. Mainly neurological symptoms. Weird, huh? Keep up those maintenance medications- I think that‚Äôs what saved me.(#4)So I'm pretty sure both me and my husband have covid right now (waiting for my PCR test results, but he lost his sense of smell, so...). I work retail and had 4 recent close contact exposures and he's had 3 coworkers recently out with it. Sucks, but honestly surprised we made it this far without getting it. 

My city already has omicron spreading and has had an infection rate that just never seems to die down (Texas, it's great fun).  

We're both triple vaxed (boosted in early October). I had a steroid shot that lasts 3 months in late November. I get this usually once a quarter to once every 6 months for my allergies. 

He's had symptoms of a bad cold, I've had symptoms of a very weird, minor cold. Headache, sinus drainage/pressure, scratchy throat, occasional cough. Once to twice a day I feel a ""weight on my chest"", but my proair gets me back to usual right away. 

Both of us are on Breo and have only had to use our rescue inhalers a few times so far (symptoms started Friday). 

The worst thing I've dealt with so far is the headache and fatigue. I feel okay until I try to clean or something and then I feel wiped out for hours. 

It's smart to be cautious, but also talk to your doctor about what to have on hand in case you catch it. I have my nebulizer vials handy incase I need it and broke out my emergency pack of prednisolone for him. He's been taking cold/flu OTC medicine round the clock, I bumped up my decongestants to round the clock instead of once a day (Mucinex+ Sudafed). 

Normally any cold or viral infection sets my asthma off into bronchitis and I have to rely on my nebulizer constantly to settle it back down. So far, doing way better than I could have hoped for with this virus. 

I 100% understand and empathize with your worry about the hospital being too full to see you. It's a worry I've had for myself and family since 2020. Best thing to do is mask up, wash your hands and make sure your meds are available when/if you need them.(#5)Getting my booster in 2 days!(#6)I was scared of covid too. Until I got it. Pretty much just a bad cold. Didn't even need to use my nebulizer, the albuterol inhaler kept it in check. I actually got sicker off the vaccine itself, granted that was only for 1 day vs the virus where I felt dumpy for 2-3 days. I know this is just 1 anecdotal case but imo, if you're vaccinated and have good control over your asthma, you'll be fine.(#7)That makes sense.  I was scared too so my doc made sure tp give me a nebulizer for home use and fresh refills for inhalers and solutions.  I can handle all that at home.   After all that if I am not better I would head to a hospital.(#8)Hey I understand your concerns, mine can get bad at times. However what brings me peace of mind is that I have recently seen several studies that a lot of corticosteroid asthma medications help in the instance of covid in terms of minimising symptoms & severity as preventing hospitalisation. I still haven‚Äôt had COVID yet but it helps to know my prescribed inhalers (I take Breo) would likely help me if I were to get it. 

‚ÄúStudies have also shown that the use of inhaled steroids in people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reduced the receptor that allows Sars-CoV-2 into the lungs, said Bloom, and lab work has shown that inhaled steroids can possibly prevent virus replication.‚Äù

‚ÄúEarly treatment with a medication commonly used to treat asthma appears to significantly reduce the need for urgent care and hospitalization in people with COVID-19, researchers at the University of Oxford have found.‚Äù

https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-asthma-treatment-int-idUSKBN2A92M7(#9)Hi fellow asthmatic here who just tested positive. I‚Äôm okay so far! The biggest thing is making sure to cough up phlegm and not keep it down because then it can build up in your lungs. But I‚Äôve had no wheezing. The media only tells you about the bad cases, not the thousands of people who recover successfully. My mom also has asthma and got double pneumonia and made it through. 
Keep being cautious and take breaks from social media to help reduce your anxiety!(#10)I don't know how reliable the source was, but I saw a line graph showing data from a nursing home, the triple vaxxed residents were hardly even catching covid while double vaxxed had a pretty high rate and non vaxxed was of course super high. But it showed that the booster was working against the new variant.

I also saw a similar post in this sub a while back where folks were saying in the comments that if your asthma is already pretty well maintained then covid isn't going to hurt you too badly. I am still afraid of it myself, I wear my mask religiously regardless of the mask status of those around me. I live in WA state which has been pretty strict about masks (only a small gap in mask requirements last summer before the delta). I do notice that a lot of people are just not wearing masks anymore...and that is scary! But I am able to avoid being around those people. 

The only thing I leave my house for is shopping that can't be done online. I go grocery shopping about once a week and I did a bit of xmas shopping last weekend (early in the morning to avoid crowds). I use a ton of hand sanitizer and I wash my hands the second I have taken off my outerwear when I come home. 

I think if we all still keep doing those things, we should be okay. Do your best to limit your exposure to people who are not able to be safe like that.(#11)I'm a bit worried too, and I'm double vaxxed & boosted too, but hopefully you'll be ok because I keep reading that the booster should amp up the protection.  Maybe the best thing to tell you, though, was earlier today I saw some CDC stats showing the % of new cases and deaths in unvaccinated and vaccinated, and the numbers for vaccinated were far lower.(#12)I‚Äôve had it and have asthma, breathing wasn‚Äôt affected one bit which was confirmed with daily peak flow and blood oxygen measurements (at the request of my doctor) 

If you‚Äôre jabbed then it‚Äôs highly highly unlikely you‚Äôll become seriously ill(#13)They are finding that smart people who are vaxed, including asthmatics, have symptoms that can be treated at home.

In my state, they are predicting that 100% of the state population will have been exposed to omicron no matter how careful you are.(#14)My boss recently had asymptomatic COVID - can‚Äôt say for sure if it was omicron, but he and his wife were vaxxed and boosted. 

I don‚Äôt know if my boss is my asthmatic, but I am. I‚Äôm now boosted and I do still worry but I‚Äôm a bit lax about it because I still take the precautions. Of course, I‚Äôm not speaking for every asthmatic, but as long as I keep doing what I need to do to say safe, everything else is out of my control. 

I get scared, too. Even when I get a cold, my coughs are just long lasting, but I‚Äôm doing everything I can. And that‚Äôs the best I can do(#15)Studies (available online, google them) have been showing that asthma patients with Covid have been fine with the previous variants, and latest studies on Omicron point to it being a milder virus.  I found all that to be very comforting.  With so many new variants, I have made a new goal for myself - get healthy, get active, boost my immune system in general, so whatever other diseases of the future won't take me down so hard.  I would encourage everyone to do the same, esp. those of us with comorbidities.  Take supplements and eat good healthy foods, like fermented foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, more veggies in general).  Start working out and change your lifestyle to be more active.  There is new research coming out about this stuff every day.  I find it helpful for my anxiety to be proactive, at least I can tell myself I am really trying.

Okay, all that said, I may have caught it.  A cousin tested positive, and my husband has just yesterday.  I'm masking around him, but feeling some minor symptoms.  I had the 3rd shot just a few weeks ago, so if I don't get any worse, it may be safe to say that the booster really did it's job and lessened the symptoms.  No respiratory trouble for me so far, just flu-like aches.  We will see.  Don't worry too much, but do what you can, too.(#16)I got covid pre vaccine in 2020. It wrecked my lungs. I had to get back onto my inhalers. 

However I had asthmatic friends who got Delta and omicron, and they seemed to not be as bad. The vaccines and boosters seemed to help significantly. 

Hope that eases your mind a bit.(#17)Yes I think it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to not be able to breathe, was thinking about this the other day. Anyone who has gasped for air has some real perspective on how this might go.(#18)The only people that should be worried are the unvaccinated and the elderly and infirm. Asthma isn‚Äôt an indicator for severe response to covid, generally. You‚Äôll be fine. Keep being careful. Delta missed you. Even if omicron doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôll most likely be mild for you since you‚Äôre boosted. You‚Äôll be grand.(#19)I feel the EXACT same way. I‚Äôm so grateful for the vaccines but I just don‚Äôt know if it will work and prevent an asthma attack. It makes me just want to stay at home forever :/(#20)All of us asthmatics are scared(#21)They want you to be afraid. You should be able to live your life and it‚Äôs not normal to act like death is around every corner. Keep your inhalers, work out, eat healthy, and stay positive and you‚Äôll be fine.(#22)Same(#23)The only thing you can do is wear a mask. Don‚Äôt touch your face and wash your hands after being out in public.

You can only control what you do not what others do. 

Do your part, eat healthy, stay positive and you‚Äôll be doing the best you can do to stay healthy.(#24)Anyone have kids with asthma get COVID? Any variant? We‚Äôve kept our daughter home til should could be vaxxed but now with this, who knows how much longer(#25)At some point, life needs to go on. It's unrealistic to expect everyone in the world make severe and drastic life long adaptations to make you feel better about your exposure and risk factors. 

The negative implications to the economy, jobs, mental health, physical health etc are going to be worse than COVID if crap goes on too long. 

The world is a big dark scary place. It sucks but we have to deal. 

Find a new way to live. Focus on the things in the world you have control over, not the things you don't. Stop watching the news if it freaks you out, they misrepresent reality most of the time anyways. Focus on things that help your anxiety and fears. Again don't focus on things you can't control. It leads to excessive worry that doesn't lead to anything good.(#26)Karma will come for them."
Is it worth it?,6,0.88,3,"(#1)Go see the ENT. I had to fight for 3 years for a referral to an ENT and by the time I was able to go, I had to have fairly involved surgery.(#2)I second the ENT, having them do a scope can rule out so many things! Or perhaps help with a proper treatment plan. Also singular can make a big difference over time, I certainly always notice when I have stopped taking it.(#3)Like the other said, probably a good idea, but I would do so on the advice of the allergist over the PCP. My experience with this: I started suffering from asthma about 12 years ago. A few years after that, I starting feeling like crap all the time. I kept going to my PCP, he kept giving me prednisone. Finally he referred me to an ENT. Turned out I had a deviated septum, so had surgery for that (not fun). Afterward I could breathe better, still felt like crap all the time. So I changed PCP‚Äôs in hopes of better treatment. New doc‚Äôs first question was whether I had seen an allergist. Um, no? Turned out the problem was allergies the whole time and I had no idea. My allergist is now my main doc I see for anything at all respiratory. He‚Äôs made the allergy issue way better, and does a much better job giving me the right meds for long term asthma care. My PCP I don‚Äôt even talk to about respiratory, and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt go back to ENT except on the advice of my allergist.

Also, singulair works great for me, makes a real difference. Give that a shot. Works great for some, but not everyone. It will take a few weeks to get any result. But if I go off it for more than a day or two I can tell."
Ventolin not working?,8,0.9,29,"(#1)Never had that experience personally, my doctor has told me if all else fails (Ventolin or head in freezer) to use the Symbicort for emergency use but not to rely on it daily as a fast acting reliever. If you feel Symbicort is the only thing that works fast I would discuss that with your doctor ASAP to find an alternative. Hope you find a solution, wishing you the clearest of airways!(#2)Symbicort and Ventolin are the system I‚Äôve been on for 15+ years. When I have a flare up that‚Äôs bad I increase my Symbicort from 4 a day to 8 puffs a day plus my Ventolin as need. With your Ventolin make sure you‚Äôre using a aerochamber if you don‚Äôt have one I‚Äôd highly recommend getting one. A medical professional once told me you lose up to 70% of the medicine without an aerochamber. 

How many puffs and how often are you using your Ventolin?If you‚Äôre getting zero relief from the Ventolin or it‚Äôs barely putting a dent in it you should see your doc, they might put you on a course of prednisone. 

Hope things improve!(#3)What type of inhaler is it?  If it‚Äôs a dry powder one, you may find that a propellant one is better (dry powder inhalers make me cough horribly, which is not useful).  If you are using a propellant one, you may find using a spacer helps.  I tend to find that my salbutamol is rarely effective without a spacer, as it just gets caught on the back of my throat and like with a dry powder inhaler, makes me cough.  With a spacer it actually gets into my lungs.  There are some great resources on inhaler techniques, as well as general asthma advice, on the asthma UK website that can help.  The best piece of advice I have though, is if your meds aren‚Äôt working, then go back to your doctor and tell them, as they are best placed to advise.(#4)Are you using a spacer with your ventolin? Has a healthcare provider watched your inhaler technique? One reason it might not be working is if the medication isn't actually reaching your lungs, which can happen if your inhaler technique isn't correct. Using a spacer and inhaling slowly (so the spacer doesn't make a whistling sound) can help get more medication in your lungs and less in your mouth and throat. 

Symbicort is approved as a fast acting reliever, so if your doctor/np has okayed this it might be worth a try. What's helpful about using Symbicort as a reliever is that it can also help treat the cause of the attack since it has steroid in it. You end up taking more steroid on days when you have attacks, which helps treat the inflammation that is precipitating the attacks. 

And of course I'd recommend talking to your healthcare provider :) if you don't have a spacer you may actually need a prescription for it, you do where I am at least!(#5)I‚Äôve heard one should use Ventolin as a bronchodilator 15mins before using Symbicort. Because it dilated your bronchitis so the effect of Symbicort puffs will be increased. Give it a try.(#6)Are you sure it's the Ventolin and not the Simbicort? From my experience Simbicort made my asthma worse. 

I take levalbuteral instead as my rescue.

Long story short Simbicort made my asthma worse. Flovent made me feel super tired and sick daily the higher dosage I went the worse the mucus got. It normally takes my levalbuteral about 30mins to start working with flovent like an hour.

Switched to dulera a few days ago and I feel great no side effects so far! Not every medication is for everyone.

Also when I first took levalbuteral it gave me a panic attack(#7)[deleted]"
Best peak flow meter?,2,1.0,3,"(#1)I use the MIR Spirobank
 https://www.spirometry.com/prodotti/spirobank-smart/

It is quite expensive, but apart from giving you the basic peak flow rate it can also show you FEV1/FVC graphs and many more values.
Kinda a small and not quite as accurate version as the spirometers used in a pulmonologists office.

It also comes with an app that logs all values over time, which can be really useful.(#2)Cipla"
Is this normal? The readings. Not had reliever,25,0.93,34,"(#1)Looks fine. If Sp02 becomes consistently under 94 then its something to start worrying about.(#2)If your SpO2 is above 90, you‚Äôre good. Normal resting heart rate generally spans from 60-100 beats per min. If you‚Äôre a bit above on some readings, I wouldn‚Äôt worry. Stress can increase heart rate, as can some asthma meds, and of course movement increases heart rate, as well. Those readings look ok to me.(#3)Your SpO2 is normal. Pulse is high, but that's most likely not related to ur asthma. Could be number of reasons, should investigate it. U could have sinus tachycardia of unknown origin which would require u to take meds like beta blockers. It's not healthy to be at such a high pulse consistently.

Inhalers do tend to increase heart rate, but that typically resolves pretty quickly.(#4)Sats are normal 94-100%
Pulse normal 60-100bpm(#5)Good, its just because I haven't done much, been needing reliever every morning(#6)That was about 12 hours ago now if that makes a difference(#7)O2 looks normal to me.(#8)Depending on your medical history, yes.  I fluctuate between 85 & 96.  Usually lowest after doing something strenuous, like walking up a flght of stairs.  And highest when not doing anything but sitting.(#9)not asthma related, but definitely start paying attention to your heart rate if it‚Äôs going around 100bpm resting. 

mine gradually made its way to 200bpm when standing over the course of a couple weeks after i noticed my resting heart rate consistently being >100. as it turns out, i have hyperthyroidism. 

just thought i‚Äôd put that out there in case. it‚Äôs been one helluva month!(#10)Pulse ox looks low. If consistently under 90 talk to your doctor and double check your device."
Have you ever moved because your allergies and asthma are so bad?,21,1.0,35,"(#1)I moved from Denver to Atlanta to escape crazy asthma and allergies in Colorado. The pollution would just get trapped in the valley and suffocate me, then escaping to the mountains would add altitude issues to the problem. There are things I‚Äôm allergic to in Atlanta, but the lower altitude and higher humidity have been helpful to me. The dry air out west did not help my asthma, although I‚Äôve heard others say it does for them personally.(#2)I'm from MI and lived in CO for two years, and both my mom and I have asthma. The desert can help with asthma because the humidity is so low, however, I found my allergies were substantially worse (there's stuff I'm allergic to in CO that doesn't grow in MI), and my mom consistently found that the altitude difference would trigger her asthma, even without going up into the mountains. After living at the higher altitude for a while, my lungs felt much stronger for a few months when I moved back to sea level, but it wasn't a permanent change and I definitely didn't feel it when I was there.

We never had serious wild fires while I was there, but some of the PNW wildfire smoke made its way to MI this past summer and I had to stay inside until it cleared.(#3)Thank you for sharing your experiences with me!! I‚Äôm sorry you all have to feel this way too, I‚Äôm so tired of living in a bubble! My husband and I have gone back-and-forth if a cross country move is worth it, and my family doctor said I should be leery of what they called a honeymoon phase. That I might feel great for a few months but asthma does not go away and I would probably start becoming allergic to whatever was there. She did say AZ could be an option but not sure how well I would do in that type of heat. The humidity is killing me here. It‚Äôs raining for a few days and then it‚Äôs cold for a few days and then it‚Äôs in the 70s for a few days all in the middle of December, and I‚Äôm getting really annoyed with mother nature here. üôÑüò£(#4)Well I'm in DFW and my allergies have kept me from sleeping for the last 2 weeks. I think its just bad everywhere right now.(#5)I'm questioning the same thing since I work in an old building  and the house I live in live in is really old. I noticed that up here in Michigan during the summer my asthma gets worse and in the winter it gets better slightly. I keep questioning if I should just move to a desert area since I'm allergic to so many different types of trees and grass.(#6)Allergies, air pollution, and yeah, wildfires all vary.  I haven't moved because of allergies/asthma, but have contemplated it.  I'm in Las Cruces, NM, which is a growing small city, so you wouldn't think the air quality would be bad, but it's not real far north of El Paso/Juarez, plus there's a lot of agriculture here (which causes some dust sometimes), plus I've found maps online showing how stuff occasionally blows over here from CA, or up from Mexico.  Plus there are occasional dust storms (just like Phoenix/Tucson) due to high winds.  Most of the time none of this is present, but when it is, it sucks.

But good luck with your situation and condition.  If you do consider moving West, just do some research on dust storms, air pollution, allergies...(#7)Yes! Mine was always bad as a kid but got better once I moved to basically any other city.  Funnily enough, cities with lots of traffic were where I did best.  LA was good too but hadn't experienced wildfires so I couldn't say.(#8)valleys really mess me up. in phoenix now and pollen levels aren‚Äôt high but the air is inverted in winter so it‚Äôs stale and dust and pollutants just sit in it. i drive to northern az a lot just so i can breathe- living at higher altitudes helps me. good luck(#9)Yes. Moved to the east coast from central TX to escape allergies and asthma. 

It was a life-changing decision. I feel so, so much better.(#10)I'm in the Dayton Ohio area and know how you feel. Every single time I get in a good groove on my allergy shots I get hit hard by a sinus infection that brings me out a week or two and they have to restart my serum. It's so frustrating. I'd love to move out West somewhere but don't think it's possible for me anymore.(#11)Okay so I moved to WV not for asthma reasons but my allergies are so much more manageable here(still bad). When I go visit my parents in SC I have to take my nebulizer with me and lots of benadryl. I've been out west for a while also I had some trouble with the altitude (I have reduced lung capacity due to cancer) but not alot of allergies.(#12)My asthma is much worse in cold weather, both indoors and outdoors. I've wanted to move somewhere warmer for a long time.(#13)I moved from northwest to southeast where my allergies and asthma intensified. I moved back to the cold north where even though it's high altitude my allergies are under control(#14)nope here in canada im used to the symptoms i get . but say in the winter i go on vacation to another place i get terrible flare ups , twice in a row in florida i got major flare ups , and few years back in british columbia my asthma couldnt handle it , so with me say if i had to move for work or something it be like the other way around"
Singulair,11,0.93,26,"(#1)I'm on Montelukast aka Singulair and it's had no affect on my mental health and I do have severe mental health issues. Just because there's a warning, doesn't mean everyone will get that side effect.(#2)I've had anxiety related issues my entire life. Singulair hasn't made it worse(#3)I haven't had any issues with montelukast (the generic version of Singulair), but it's worth a conversation with your doctor. Hope you get everything sorted out!(#4)I had bad side effects from montelukast(sing), I switched from Zyrtec/and that purple one ever 6 months instead now.(#5)Wow. I hadn't heard that. I just looked it up, and saw that mentioned as a rare side effect, but then did see a warning about that listed among side effects on [drugs.com](https://drugs.com).  I've been on it for maybe 10 years and haven't noticed any side effects like that, but obviously, if you don't think you had any of those mental conditions before starting on singulair, you should mention that to your doctor ASAP.(#6)My 3 year old is on Montelukast (Singulair) and has occasional night terrors.

We have thought about stopping him but his Asthma isn't the best controlled and so it's a tough decision between maybe finding another treatment that works (but with the increased risk in the meantime) or continuing the Montelukast.

Currently, and with the issues with COVID, we are erring on the side of caution and continuing the Montelukast.(#7)I had worse asthma when I was a kid and I was given montelukast. Had occasional night terrors that were bad enough to make me sick my bed. I do have anxiety and am medicated for it but I honestly still don't know if that was the thing that made my anxiety worse or I just had it all along. It's just something I think about time and again.(#8)Singulair/montelukast has serious recorded neuropsychiatric effects in some patients. And in some patients, they have no side effects whatsoever. I was one of the unfortunate ones. Cognitive decline, severe depresseion, and just overall 'emptiness'. I was on it for 5 years and these side effects came on progressively and worsened over time. 

&#x200B;

I went to HALF the dose I was taking and it was like night and day. I would strongly urge you to start the conversation with your doctor and discontinue the medication under their care.(#9)ive tried to stop singulair.. theres no way i can ü•≤(#10)I had to stop due to anxiety and night terrors. Still dealing with anxiety but it was immediately better.(#11)I've been taking singular for about 3 years now and now that I think about it I think is giving me slight anxiety.(#12)I was on it for 2 weeks before I had to stop. It made my anxiety off-the-charts terrible, with what felt like constant panic attacks. A day or so after I stopped I felt so much better. My allergist put me on an inhaled corticosteroid which has worked great with no side effects.(#13)[deleted](#14)I‚Äôve been on montelukast for 2 months now and have randomly been getting extreme anxiety and panic attacks to the point that my primary doctor put me on antidepressants. Now I do have a history of anxiety and panic attacks but they have been relatively dormant for the last 5 years. I‚Äôve been extremely confused because I have had no mental triggers that would bring on such anxiety randomly like this after so long. I saw a different doctor for a second opinion and he wants me to stop taking the montelukast and mentioned he would never put someone with anxiety on that medicine. I also spoke to my therapist about it and she heard the same thing about montelukast/singulair. I see a lot of people on here are having success with that pill, which I wish I did, but I am going to try and get off of it and use my inhaler when needed and pray this helps with the anxiety! Good luck to anyone else experiencing the same thing!"
How long did you use nebulizer treatments after having a cold/RSV/Flu and bronchitis?,1,0.67,2,"(#1)I actually had RSV around Halloween this year.  I was using the nebulizer for about a month (only felt ""sick"" for about a week, but it was a super rough week).  I had viral bronchitis in college and also used the nebulizer for about 3 weeks to a month.  Usually only once a day, in the evening or at night right before bed.(#2)The best thing to do is to ask your doctor as I can‚Äôt give medical advice.

I was put on a nebulizer 2 weeks ago after having bronchitis and my symptoms are mostly gone except for an occasional cough.  I am following up with my doctor next week."
Question re: asthma & cooking,6,0.87,9,"(#1)If you are hitting the smoke point every time you cook, your heat is too high. You should be able to saute without torching the oil.(#2)It could also be the pan. Non-stick surfaces are notoriously dangerous due to the chemicals they release."
Recently Half Ass Diagnosed,7,0.9,23,"(#1)Yes theres a thing called allergy induced asthma . lots of people have it its real common(#2)Ignoring asthma can result in long term lung damage. I should've been diagnosed as a kid and I wasn't. I really wish I had gotten treatment as kid.(#3)If you're waking up with shortness of breath that's a sign your asthma is not controlled (I've had asthma my whole life; when my doctor heard I was waking up with asthma she was very concerned and wanted to adjust my treatments). 

Asthma is annoying but it doesn't have to limit you at all if you're just careful and use the right meds. Allergy pill and inhaler are pretty standard first steps.

Allergic asthma is the most common form of asthma. Even if you aren't having other allergy symptoms like itching or sneezing, your allergy is manifesting as asthma.  If you ignore it, you may have more complications down the line. Besides, it's much cheaper to carry an inhaler than to risk it and end up in the emergency room one day. Even mild asthma can randomly make itself an emergency if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.

If you're concerned about using an inhaler, I promise you it's one of the least severe medications to have. It's only 90 micrograms of albuterol, and I'm reading that you can have up to 12 of those doses a day. I've been taught that in an emergency, you can administer one dose every minute (not exceeding the adult limit of doses). What I'm saying is, the dose is not very high and you have a limit far above what you'd normally need to take. (Most adults need 1-2 puffs to manage asthma in your average situation). 

Albuterol can cause people to feel nervous, shaky, and can increase heart rate. It can even increase blood pressure for some people. This means it's not *always* the most comfortable medication to use. However, in someone who's asthma is under control and the drug is only needed once in a while, that's considered a lot safer than risking respiratory arrest. Your inhaler can prevent you from having a more serious emergency, so for real, just keep it in your back pocket!

I'm sorry you're going through this and I'm sorry I wrote a long comment. I hope you feel better in time!!!(#4)I assume your doctor has recommended trying allergy meds to see if that gets things in control?(#5)The inhaler that is your response to the inhaler (albuterol/ventolin/salbutamol ‚Ä¶) can also give you feedback if you have asthma or not. If it works, then asthma is likely. 

At some point they should confirm the diagnosis with spirometry, but in the meantime, using the inhaler is a good thing.(#6)I have allergic asthma I have had allergies in the summer. After 5 years I developed allergic asthma year round. Immunotherapy did not work and made me sick. You can develop asthma at any time even if you only have basic allergy symptoms.(#7)lots of people new to asthma are like oh, puffers how awful. 

But reality is it takes a couple of seconds and is sort of like a miracle cure for asthma.

Assuming you have it ( I would want a 100% diagnosis) you might get luck y and have rare symptoms and not need a daily preventer but if you do need a daily preventer, be happy it exists and don't be stubborn about it, they are awesome.

im just saying don't worry about the puffer, its not the issue the asthma is 99% of the pain in the butt, the puffer is 1%"
Dulera muscle spasms,4,0.75,15,"(#1)Yes! Try adding more potassium to your diet. I got them all the time in my feet and that‚Äôs what it ended up being. Did some research and found out Dulera depletes potassium which is what normally causes muscle spasms. If that doesn‚Äôt help, talk to your doctor ASAP.(#2)Not on dulera, but recently started wixela in November (was on symbicort before and insurance stopped covering) and have found that I get muscle cramps/spasms multiple times a week. I recently realized this had all started within a few days of the new medication. They're mostly in my hands, feet, and below my breastbone. My next appointment isn't until January 19th, and I'm hoping to get a switch in meds.(#3)I get twitches with Flovent and they don't go away so I switch to Dulera.

Also do you take allergy meds could be a dust allergy.(#4)Oh wow, I never connected the two, but I did have pretty bad foot cramps on one side randomly for a month. I‚Äôve been on Dulera for years and haven‚Äôt had any other issues.(#5)Sounds like you should be talking to your doc about this.(#6)could this be related to some other medications? However you dont want to rule out any symptoms as enhaler does have impact on muscles creating muscle spasms(#7)I had debilitating leg spasms on both Dulera and Symbicort."
Need suggestions for NON SCENTED allergy nasal spray GLUCORTICOID,7,0.89,27,"(#1)Flonase has a scent?(#2)I use Avamys. It‚Äôs prescription but I find it very helpful with my allergies (which can also be triggers) and nasal congestion. I was told by one of my Doctors to be extremely careful with most of the over the counter sprays, as they can actually cause damage to the interior of your nose. Good luck!(#3)I found both generic and brand flonase to smell like flowers.(#4)I use Nasacort and haven‚Äôt had a problem or noticed a fragrance. I also smelled the rose smell in Flonase so I can‚Äôt use it. For non OTC, I‚Äôve had luck with Nasonex(#5)You could talk to your Dr about going through a custom compound pharmacy."
So hair dye is apparently one of the things that sets my asthma off,22,0.96,14,"(#1)my dad‚Äôs asthma reacts to certain scents/chemicals (hair sprays, perfumes, candles, some shampoos, etc). hair products in general have a strong smell, so i‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre referring to!(#2)Any chemical fumes can definitely be a trigger for asthma.(#3)I've never used hair dye, but just at a glance, the usual culprits for me out of these ingredients would be the alcohol (esp if it's strong) or the ""fragrance"", depending on what it is.

Depending on how badly you're reacting, maybe you could try it in a more ventilated area? You might also be able to find fragrance-free brand - just make sure to avoid products with ammonia if that's an issue for you, too.(#4)Ammonia/bleach does it for me. I find getting my hair professionally done with foils works for me since the chemical is sealed in the foil.(#5)I‚Äôll wear a disposable mask to help cut the scent when getting my hair done.(#6)I find that the ""normal"" dyes are super harsh in odor, but Splat actually had a super nice, almost cherry scent to it. No idea Why Special colors are smarter than the generic ones(#7)I cant read it super well but my suggestions are: fragrance, the coconut or any of the alcohols.

Bleaching my hair or box dyeing it black, brown, reddish also sets off my lungs. I try to have my bathroom fan going, the window open if possible and the air quality is okay and a small fan blowing on my face. I work from back to front. Then put a shower cap on. Then make sure to keep tiny fan on my face.

For me Manic Panic for more fun colors doesn‚Äôt irritate my lungs nearly as much and I‚Äôm pretty much fine. Hope this helps!(#8)Certain foods being cooked. The aroma makes me flare up bad and incense.(#9)I suggest you go to an allergist and get an allergy test. They can give you the exact allergen that caused your flare up.(#10)For me it would be the soy, but we're all different. I use Ion hair color.(#11)A family member used to get their hair dyed professionally for many many years; eventually they started having allergic / asthmatic reactions to it. Good luck in your research about the chemicals."
Psycological effect,3,0.72,2,"(#1)Yup. I can totally relate to this. This was mostly happening when my asthma wasn‚Äôt under control. I had a period of exacerbation for almost 3 months that I couldn‚Äôt get under control. Most days I felt helpless, frustrated and emotionally drained. Then if I had a good breathing day I felt unstoppable and almost forgot that I was struggling at all. Then the next day right back to feeling like shit. 

Anxiety does play a part but also making sure you have the right dosage of meds. I upped my Advair and it really helped. For me I‚Äôve found the more knowledge I have about my personal asthma the better I can deal with it. See a pulmonologist if you haven‚Äôt already. Get a peak flow meter. See an allergist. Anything you can do to better understand what‚Äôs happening the better. It takes the power out of the fear of not knowing what‚Äôs going on.(#2)Sounds like you need to see your doctor about making sure your meds are correct along with maybe seeing a therapist for tool to deal with anxiety."
Would you stay in an Airbnb for a week with asthma exacerbation?,1,0.6,9,"(#1)No one here can make that decision for you. Personally, I wouldn't be caught dead on an airplane right now, flare or no flare.(#2)Personally I would stay home and let your lungs heal.  I just recovered from an asthma flare up.  It is not fun.(#3)I was hospitalized over thanksgiving weekend for an acute asthma exacerbation. I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to be out of town for that much less out of state where maybe my insurance wouldn‚Äôt be valid.

Do you have a pulse oximeter? That can tell you when your oxygen gets dangerously low.(#4)I am a firm believer of pushing on in life despite medical problems. I see people travelling the world in wheelchairs or running with one leg (Terry fox) , or performing until they can't get out of bed and I am like.. I hope that is me.

Being sick or in pain on a trip or at home ? not that much different.(#5)I am dealing with a bad flare up and sadly had to make the choice to stay home. Ended up being the best one because the air bnb was a wreck and my friends said it would‚Äôve been the wrong call in retrospect. Life is a balance of making sure to still find ways to enjoy it even when sick and also assessing risks of activity. I tend to avoid airplanes when flared up because catching anything else on top of it is horrible and makes it worse. Try to avoid travel because it‚Äôs hard on me. But also living life is important."
Asthma and intermittent vocal chord dysfunction,4,1.0,4,"(#1)Sounds like allergies that then make the asthma worse. Have been through very similar to you. It‚Äôs not all in your head. Constant pred is no fun either. Keep on your meds(#2)Sorry to hear that you're having these problems.

I was diagnosed with asthma at age 6. I had a similar issue to you a few years ago in my late twenties. My lungs looked fine on xrays/ct etc but my ability to exercise went from 5-10 hours of competive sport a week to struggling to climb the stairs. After various antibiotics for a probable chest infection, doctors kept trying to treat my asthma and it seemed to help a little bit, but not solve the problem. It was particularly distressing that some seemed to think it was all in my head; some were nicer than others. 

In the end, after a few years of doctors visits, my issue turned out to be acid reflux that was making my asthma symptoms much worse. Some types of acid reflux don't present with the typical burning sensation in the oesophagus. I didn't get any benefits from lansoprazole, but 40mg of omeprazole spread out over the day helped a lot and now I largely just avoid certain foods. In addition to a constant productive cough and inability to walk up hill at more than a snail's pace, I'd sometimes have an inexplicably runny nose. On occasion, at their worst, I would describe my lungs as having accordion like properties; I'd breathe in and there would be a slight delay in them inflating. 

My acid reflux has largely gone now, and my asthma remains but at a much more manageable level.

It may take a while, but the doctors get there in the end. Good luck with your search. All the best.(#3)Thank you for your input. I think it might be the house I‚Äôm living in. That is the only thing that would make sense. I am deathly allergic to mold and dust and I know for certain that the house I live in has a dust problem and a possible mold problem in the bathroom. I appreciate y‚Äôall üôèüèºüôèüèº(#4)If you haven‚Äôt seen an allergist I highly suggest you do so. I was put on Singulair and it helped. I also struggle with GERD and tried changing my diet to low acid foods. I noticed a difference with that too. Unfortunately asthma is a lot of trial and error. Keep at it! Don‚Äôt give up until you‚Äôre feeling better."
Has anyone in the UK had their salbutamol inhaler changed to a more environmentally friendly version and found that it doesn‚Äôt work?,4,0.83,12,"(#1)It‚Äôs rubbish! Definitely doesn‚Äôt feel the same to me.(#2)Yeah, the short stumpy blue inhaler?(#3)Go to the pharmacy and tell the pharmacist that the new inhaler isn't working. Maybe they can give you a different generic brand.(#4)I‚Äôve got the Salamol ones, are they smaller than your old ones, or I am thinking of ventolin?(#5)I'm in the US but I think our albuterol inhaler is basically the same thing.  I do well with the name brand but I have to pay $80 for it. The Teva generic is ok, the Lupin one doesn't work and I get the pharmacy to order a different generic.(#6)I've not had this happen (yet?), but they already know I don't get on with Salamol.(#7)CFCs were phased out over 15 years ago. I don't even know why your clinic would even say ""more environmentally friendly"".

Salamol appears to be the brand name version of salbutamol.(#8)Salbutamol inhalers should always be prescribed by brand in the UK so you always get the same one.

Call your GP and get them to re-prescribe but with the brand name that you have previously had.

AIUI, Salamol haven't recently changed any formulation or anything and so if you previously had Salamol then you shouldn't have a difference.

If you feel it's not working correctly, call the GP and get another prescription / asthma review - there's a chance that you have a faulty inhaler."
Has anyone tried Dupixent injections and what was your experience?,21,0.93,34,"(#1)It may eliminate steroid use (and usually does) but it will not remove the need for maintenance and rescue inhalers, generally. 

Also, it is very expensive. Good insurance is required. 

It has worked wonders for a friend of mine and a friend‚Äôs son who have both asthma and eczema. They still use a daily preventative inhaler.(#2)I‚Äôve been off and on Dupixent for the past 4 years. I used to have severe asthma as well as eczema. When I‚Äôm on Dupixent I don‚Äôt use my inhaler, nor do I use any preventatives. I still need to take an allergy pill everyday and night but that‚Äôs it. I could go as far as saying Dupixent cured both my asthma and eczema. It‚Äôs a miracle drug.(#3)I have had severe persistent asthma all of my adult life. Dependent on oral steroids for the last 18 years. The side effects of that are every bit as awful as they tell you.
 On top of that, I use 3 controller inhalers daily. I still couldn‚Äôt get a decent deep breath. Until Dupixant. I‚Äôm about 5 weeks into using it. The difference is astonishing. It‚Äôs so nice to be able to breathe! The only time my lungs ever feel this good, is with multiple rounds of high dose prednisone. 
  They are actually talking about starting to wean me off the prednisone. I never thought I would see that day. This stuff is life changing!(#4)Dupixent is prescribed for eosinophilic asthma/oral steroid-dependent asthma. 

Whether it is effective for other forms of asthma I don‚Äôt know but it‚Äôs worth a discussion with your pulmonologist.(#5)I‚Äôve been on Dupixent for a little under a year now. I had severe asthma that made me steroid dependent and this was driven by high eosinophils (you can look in my past posts for more info). I was originally on Fasenra, but after getting very bad inflammation and nasal polyps in my nose that needed surgery to fix, I switched to Dupixent to solve the nasal and asthma issues. I can‚Äôt say I notice a huge difference from Fasenra, besides for the difference in time between shots (1 mo for Fasenra, 2 wks for Dupixent) but they‚Äôve both made huge changes in my life and my asthma is now manageable. It is expensive, unfortunately, but it‚Äôs worth it for me for quality of life.(#6)I‚Äôve been on Dupixent pretty much since it was approved. I was also a guinea pig for a couple of the trials.  I still use Breo daily and have a rescue inhaler, but only use that occasionally (it took close to 15 months to go through my 200 inhales and I think most of those were used proactively for exercise).  It has really helped me.  On top of the asthma, it helped clear up my sinus issues and allergies.  As others have said it is pretty expensive, but my insurance does cover it.(#7)I was on Dupixent for 6 months and I was pretty close to getting off my maintenance inhaler! It worked wonders for me. I never had to pay anything for it because I had pretty good insurance so I can‚Äôt really comment on that. It did give me eczema spots on my legs where I did the shots which was a bummer but it was still worth it to me.(#8)I have used a daily steroid inhaler most of my life. Started Dupixent for eczema symptoms in February of 2021 and completely stoped using the steroid inhaler after one month of Dupixent and have had to use albuterol inhaler only a handful of times. So far have not experienced any side effects from the Dupixent and it completely eliminated the eczema as well. It has been a miracle drug for me personally. Well worth the try.(#9)It depends on if you are the correct ‚Äútype‚Äù of asthma so as long as you are it‚Äôs a wonderful drug.(#10)I've had asthma for over 30 years, and was recently diagnosed with eosinophilic asthma. I was on over five inhalers, one oral medication, and taking prednisone at least eight times a year when I was finally introduced to Dupixent. From the next day following my starter doses, I noticed a difference already! I have been on it for 7 months now, and have never felt better in my life! I'm off of all inhalers, I keep one rescue inhaler for a just in case instance, take no more prednisone or oral medication for it! It has been a game changer, a life changer, and I hope to stay on it for as long as possible.(#11) I self inject every 15 days with a simple pen injection. So easy and painless.(#12)Dupixent is a serious biologic drug intended for patients with moderate to severe asthma who are steroid dependent (oral not inhaled steroids) or who have asthma with an eosinophillic phenotype. It also is for certain skin conditions. Inhaled steroid use is not considered steroid dependency, it is referring to oral steroids such as prednisone.

 Dupixent is meant as an add-on to maintenance medications not a replacement. It can help to reduce severe exacerbations and potentially reduce the amount of oral steroids needed.

 IME the criteria for approval is high (but depends on your insurance I'm sure). The cost is approx $3,500 per month, which is why insurance is picky about criteria for approval. There is an assistance copay program through the drug manufacturer which can greatly reduce patient OOP costs.

The drug has worked wonders for some patients. It did nothing for me and I discontinued it after a year.(#13)I'm starting it for a mystery rash but then saw it can help with asthma so I was happy. It's about seven grand a month for me and my doctor had to jump through hoops to get it. 
The needle is long though. Very ouch(#14)I‚Äôm on Dupixent, but am likely stopping after my next doctors appointment. I was put on it for persistent nasal polyps and asthma (AERD). The side affects have been horrible. It does work. Pretty amazingly. The side affects (for me), have been migraines with blurry vision, and occasional loss of sight in one eye."
Ketotifen,0,0.5,1,(#1)These sound like questions for your pharmacist.
"Laughter is The Best Medicine, Unless You Have Asthma",61,0.97,13,"(#1)This is true though. I'll be laughing my head off and then I'll suddenly go into an asthma attack.(#2)Having to suppress laughs on something I find really funny kills my mood sometimes /:(#3)I'm working on a comedy podcast with a good mate next year and I'm already thinking of problems such as this..(#4)Just thinking of myself having asthma alone makes me want to cough already. Physical does matter, but at this point mental destroyed me harder.(#5)I'd forgotten that laughter can set some people off.  It's good for me, but several other things set off the asthma.(#6)Last week, I had an asthma attack from laughing at the iCarly jokes that made parents ban their kids from watching it."
The severity of my asthma has gone way down in recent years but google says asthma doesn‚Äôt go away. Any ideas on what caused this?,19,0.96,37,"(#1)The only time I‚Äôve heard of asthma actually ‚Äúgoing away‚Äù is childhood asthma where the kid grows out of it. It doesn‚Äôt sound like your asthma has totally gone away, but sometimes symptoms & overall management level can get better with the right treatment. I‚Äôm guessing your treatments are working or you have fewer triggers that make it more noticeable.(#2)I‚Äôm curious if you‚Äôve made any changes to your diet, exercise, or environment in those years that could be a factor. Those are the three factors that most influence the severity of my asthma.(#3)I'm brittle/chronic since birth yet my asthma sorta took a holiday whilst I was giving birth/feeding babies, even my allergies let up for a few years. I slowly went back to \~8 different puffers but once the puffers improved am now back to 3.

One grandaughter has already outgrown it (fingers crossed), one grandson is growing into it...damn!

Yes, I know many people and family members where it comes in waves over time. It can depend on the actual lung formation (as is my case) or what sets you off (as is my case also).(#4)1. Don't believe everything you read on Google. 
2. You may have removed your triggers from your immediate environment
3. You need a new spirometry test done.(#5)My asthma ‚Äúleft‚Äù when I was a teen and then came back when I was about 22.(#6)Mine kind of vanished when the cat died.(#7)I ended up moving out of my parents house and my allergens were removed and I was able to breathe much better.(#8)Hello friend,

So, not really sure if that‚Äôs the case, but I got a similar experience. Until like 9yo I was havin' 2 asthma attacks per month on the average, and since then it slowly subsided - I‚Äôm 25 now, my habits are awright, and one thing that triggers me is dog hair and rarely I got attacks per se, I would say like 1 per semester‚Ä¶ My doc told me that I have mild asthma, but due to my historic I'll surely got back to an intense severity as soon as I get old‚Ä¶ 
If anyone got similar advices plz share the experience here.(#9)It can get better/worse over time. In 2015, my asthma was at it's worst ever - 3 inhalers plus neb 3x a day. Fast forward to now, I'm on one inhaler, rarely use my rescue and haven't used the neb in almost 2 years.(#10)Mine improved greatly when I moved out of my parents house at 18. In my mid 30's it got bad again.(#11)My asthma has ebbed and flowed over the years. By that I mean it spent 4-5 years slowly getting worse and then eased up a over a couple of years. Very much a slow progression, and I can't identify why. I can only think that there is some environmental factor.  

Talking to various doctors and asthma nurses, the consensus is that there are so many things that can be a trigger and you probably have several, so it can be almost impossible to identify the triggers. So, it might not be that your asthma has gone away, but you are avoiding the worst triggers. 

I've no idea if you body can learn to tolerate triggers, does anyone know if that is a thing?(#12)It can go away depending on how u manage it(#13)Asthma can go away depending on the underlying factors that cause it. If your asthma is associated with hypersensitivity to certain allergens, your immune system can eventually ""learn"" that foreign inert bodies don't actually pose a threat and reduce or eliminate the response. Or, the irritant that triggers an asthmatic response is no longer present at a high enough threshold (or at all in your environment)(#14)I was diagnosed with asthma at 38. I was on a mission to discover if something else was going on as asthma meds never helped me. I finally travelled out of state to a top pulmonologist who diagnosed me with rare, and hard to detect lung bacteria. He put me on two different antibiotics for several months. 

All my symptoms disappeared within 4 months. I suffered for almost 2 years, extremely depressed, anxious, low energy because every breath I took was miserable. 

In no way am I saying my situation is similar to yours. Just my experience. However, the doc I travelled to believes a number of lung issues are mostly caused by these hard to get rid of bacteria. There are a handful of pulmonologists and doctors that believe the same thing. Since it‚Äôs hard to detect, most doctors don‚Äôt look for it or just not aware of it.(#15)[This systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3392696/) of several studies showed that weight loss in overweight and obese asthmatics led to ""a 48%‚Äì100% remission of asthma symptoms"". Apparently for some people weight loss eliminated their asthma. Have you lost weight?"
Flixotide adverse reaction?,1,1.0,3,(#1)Steroid allergies are extremely unusual and your doctor needs to know.
Perfume,6,0.88,5,"(#1)Definitely not imaginary. Perfumes are a bunch of chemicals that float in the air, and any one of those chemicals could be a trigger. You could be fine with 99/100 perfumes but that one could contain something that triggers you.(#2)It‚Äôs absolutely not imaginary, even if people like to say it is. I‚Äôm usually fine with perfume, but if I have recently had an attack or been around a more serious trigger (my worst one is cigarette smoke - and unlucky me lives somewhere where smoking is very common) then I tend to be more sensitive to other things, including perfumes. I‚Äôm usually not sensitive to fragrance either, but if I‚Äôm already in a flare up almost anything will bother me even if it hasn‚Äôt before (air fresheners, wax melts/candles, cleaners with no harsh chemicals, etc.)(#3)I had a contractor in my house last. His cologne was was so strong I had to leave. The next day I had an attack that nearly sent me to the hospital. I was already having a flare up but I believe the cologne made it much worse. I‚Äôve also read about perfume being an imaginary trigger. Perfume is made of chemical compounds wafting around in the air. In my opinion it‚Äôs an irritant and can cause an attack in some people.(#4)Perfumes are full of chemicals that trigger my asthma. This is a recent thing for me and disappointing because I love wearing a nice perfume. I recently came across a perfume called 'This is not a perfume' that is lovely and has minimal ingredients and doesn't trigger my asthma. Maybe you could pick up a small vile, and test it out together.(#5)Although it can be imaginary, like more of an anxiety related issue due to the fear that fragrance might make you sick, I know it can definitely be a real thing.  I started to have allergic reactions to fragrances and loads of other fragrance related things 6 years ago, and was tested as very allergic at the hospital.  My symptoms include asthma, hives, runny nose, sneezing, and a headache, but mainly hives and asthma are the ones that trouble me the most.  Since I‚Äôm pretty much very allergic to everything on this planet that has scent, your case is a bit different, but you can just be allergic to say, fragrance mix II or something, and not to other types of fragrances.  
It probably will be pretty clear if you stayed away from perfumes for a while with your girlfriend, and see if they get you when you go back to them. (Though it might also be very difficult to isolate yourself from all the perfume scents that are floating about in the air anywhere you go, especially during the holidays.)"
Albuterol inhaler has became intense like a treatment from a nebulizer. Is this good as the lungs are reacting more to albuterol? Has this happened to anyone?,2,0.75,3,"(#1)It sounds like you are using the albuterol when you don't need to be using it.(#2)A year ago, when I was abusing the albuterol, I would take a puff and get back to do what I was doing whether it‚Äôs running or doing hard labor activities. Now that I am on preventative, taking a puff of albuterol is too intense and It causes me to be stationary."
Husband has asthma and covid,20,1.0,18,"(#1)Mucinex 

Sleep on stomach 

Had covid + asthma for 12 days. Used my inhalers often. It will get better(#2)The fact he‚Äôs bringing it up is good from what the nurses told me (I was put on a monitoring list called a virtual covid ward where they rang me daily to check my symptoms cause I have asthma)

I usually bring up mucus every day and when I got covid I stopped for a couple of days, then suddenly I started to bring it up again. 

The advice they gave was to keep an eye on the colour of the mucus, if it was anything other than white then to ring the doctor as I may have needed antibiotics.(#3)Call an urgent care in your location. I got a RX for 6 mg Dexamethasone x5 days and the monoclonal antiviral IV. It was written by a PA through urgent care. I was also vaxxed but so glad she gave it to me. She told me which 2 hospitals in town were providing the treatment. If that's not available, then solid advice has already been given on this thread.(#4)Add Flonase to the mix as well. This will reduce postnasal drip and help with the cough. Seconding Mucinex.

Also have him use Albuterol as needed as much as he needs to.(#5)Hope he recovers fast! I have not had covid but have had flu with intense symptomps. From personal experience in cases like this it helps to sleep sitting up(like on a couch or something).

I dont know how it works but when I lay down while sick I seem to produce more mucus and phlegm and all of it seems to go straight to my throat making me cough way more.(#6)I personally feel like actual behind the pharmacy counter (in the US) pseudofed works really wel for me when I am super congestive like this, especially when combined with mucinex. It works much better than the stuff you get in the aisle, which is supposed to be similar. 

I also personally have really good luck with soda (specifically coke) when I have a mucousy coughing fit. I imagine other soda works the same. I think the carbonation helps flush it down your esophagus better? I do know that if you feel like you have food stuck in your throat, doctors tell you to try drinking soda so maybe that is the same thing. 

Your doctor is horrible. Keep calling. Can he go to urgent care? Does he take a steroid inhaler? That really helps me.(#7)I have had asthma all my life. I had Covid in October of 2020. For me it was no different than a cold. Luckily my doctor explained that some researchers are thinking that asthmatics have an advantage over covid with the meds they take. I was comforted by these words but didn‚Äôt look in to them much.(#8)Seconding (thirding?) the mucinex plus water comments. Make sure he is getting plenty of water, the mucinex is basically useless without proper fluid intake.(#9)Asthma meds (he might need more than usual, check with his doctor) and mucinex(#10)What does his doctor recommend?"
"Does anyone take this yearly vaccine? I have been taking this for the last three years. I don't really understand if it actually works, I can't evaluate. Sometimes I feel like maybe I'm wasting my money for no reason on this. Probably it's a 4 year course.",4,0.75,5,"(#1)That's an influenza vaccine. And yes I have one yearly because the last time I got actual influenza, I was so ridiculously ill that I never want to risk that again. As asthmatics we're more prone to extra issues on top of any respiratory based infection.
This isn't a 4 year course, it's yearly. Forever. If you choose to not get it, that's up to you but know that you are at higher risk of complications.(#2)It's a flu vaccine. 

Asthmatics are usually recommended to take a flu vaccine every year. You have to keep taking it every year because the types of flu that are common change. 

The vaccine reduces the chances you will catch the flu, and reduces the chances you'll become seriously ill from the flu if you do catch it.(#3)U got one year left? Might as well finish it. Haha.

Ive never taken it myself but i have taken asthma meds orally that i assumed werent working until i stopped taking them. Quickly realized they were in fact working and i should resume taking them.(#4)It's just the flu vax and you need to get it every year for the rest of your life. It's not a 4 year thing at all.(#5)Ummm it‚Äôs just a flu shot. Take it."
How can I skate with eib?,2,1.0,8,"(#1)EIB, European Investment Bank? You should be ok, just ask about their life insurance.(#2)Medicines list crazy side effects sometimes but for most people it doesn't affect them. You should give the medicine a shot and only stop if it effects you in a negative way and that will help. Pre dose using the albuterol before exercising or as prescribed by your doctor(#3)What do you mean by EIB.  The only thing I can think you mean is exercise induced asthma, which doesn‚Äôt fit the letters, but does fit your description.  I have severe eosinophilic asthma,  and one of my triggers is exercise, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt exercise.  I avoid outside exercise when it‚Äôs cold, damp or worse, foggy, as that tends to be my worst trigger at the best of times, but otherwise, I make sure I‚Äôve taken my preventer that morning, and will take two puffs of my reliever (the blue salbutamol inhaler, like the one you‚Äôve been given) immediately before I start any exercise, and that I keep my blue inhaler at hand when I am exercising.  Exercising will help asthma long term, as it will help with lung capacity and stamina etc.  It sounds to me like what you need is some proper asthma education.  Try the asthma UK website, they have loads of info about asthma and the different ways it‚Äôs treated and potential triggers, and potentially talk to your doctor again, especially as you aren‚Äôt taking the prescribed medicine.  I can only give advice on what works for me, and it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it will work for you, but I do know that stopping skating when you want to do it, is highly unlikely to be necessary, you just need to learn how to manage your asthma, which proper disease education will help you with.(#4)Try the allergy pills. The majority of people never have any of the side effects or if they do it's the most mild one. The FDA requires a side effect to be listed if only one of the thousands of people in a clinical trial reported it.

Prior to skating, have you been doing any exercise at all or are you a couch potato? If you don't do regular exercise, you may not have EIA at all and may just be out of shape.(#5)EIB = exercise induced bronchoconstriction, guys.

You‚Äôre good to skate. Did the doctor tell you when / how to use the albuterol inhaler? Usually it‚Äôs 1-2 puffs 15 min before exercise. It will help widen your airways for several hours.

(Would also encourage you to try the other med you were prescribed; it will help get at the root of why your airways react/get narrow, which is inflammation).

The asthma UK site someone else mentioned is a great resource for learning more about asthma. Try checking out the how to use an inhaler video.

And, if you‚Äôre nervous about skating and it happening again, you could try using your inhaler and then some lighter exercise to see that it‚Äôs fine :)(#6)Yes, you can skate. Just pay attention to your body, take breaks, and use your inhaler if needed.

I'm guessing you're talking about Singulair and are talking about mental health side effects. Yes, the side effects -- when they happen -- can be terrifying. But if you're aware ahead of time and have a support system to help identify, that's enough. I take it daily during allergy season. I have a friend who had it contribute to a mental breakdown and suicide attempt...but he had no idea that it could do that so only found out later. He stopped taking it. I talked to my GP about it, he said something to the effect of, ""It is rare. You do not exhibit any signs, and the fact that you see the risk as a possible danger is actually pretty healthy. Fearing suicide isn't the same as suicidal ideation."" Granted, my GP is amazing, but even doctors who don't communicate as well often have this knowledge and are just unable to remember a time when it wasn't obvious to them.

I've got ADHD, which means I had to figure out my meds basically all on my own and just tell the psych docs what I wanted for years. So I'll tell you the thing doctors are often bad at discussing: with any medication for long-term use, give it a shot and be aware of how it makes you feel. Note the benefits and the side effects. Have someone else who knows you well assist you with this in case it affects your perception or cognitive ability. Weigh the degree to which it treats your symptoms against the degree to which side effects cause you discomfort or pain.

If it feels like a net improvement to your quality of life, continue the medication. If not, tell your doctor why you would like to discontinue it because they may have an alternate treatment route. Or they may strongly encourage you to continue the meds in spite of your side effects depending on the meds and what they are for."
Anyone else find that using preventer and reliever inhalers more makes you exhausted?,6,0.72,2,"(#1)Yes, it can. Also, after getting under control I feel exhausted.(#2)Yes. I don‚Äôt typically eat grains/sugar or seed oils. I‚Äôve noticed it triggers my asthma a lot. But with the holidays I‚Äôve been eating more food with that stuff in it and holy moly. I‚Äôm using my Flovent twice a day and need my rescue like twice a day due to some tightness. I‚Äôm exhausted and my heart rate is in the 90s when it is usually in the 70s :/"
Can someone with mild intermittent asthma have attacks,5,0.73,2,"(#1)yes even life threating(#2)Anyone with asthma can have an attack, it might be helpful to get a controller inhaler for when you have flare-ups, or permanently, it certainly helps reduce attacks."
"Is inhalers recently restricted? [CA, USA]",6,0.72,21,"(#1)Ummmmm....... Yeahhhhh.. Have him talk to his doctors about a maintenance inhaler in addition to the rescue.
I mean it. He should NOT BE USING IT THAT MUCH. He likely needs a control medication. Now.(#2)If he actually has severe asthma, why is he not on a maintenance med? A rescue inhaler isn‚Äôt going to do anything long term.(#3)He needs a new doctor.  That is way too often to use albuterol, not because the albuterol is dangerous but because that is severely uncontrolled asthma.  Plus, no one who has severe, or even moderate, asthma should be on **just** a rescue inhaler.(#4)It might be because your partner needs to be on a controller med, and not using the rescue inhaler so often. My doctor says the rescue inhaler should last six months, and if I use it more than twice a week, I need a controller med like symbicort.

So it might not be that the medication itself is restricted, but that your partner's asthma is not being treated in a safe and effective way, so the doctor is limiting the prescription so that your partner will have to go in and discuss a better treatment plan.(#5)I live in Finland but my doctor also prescripts only one rescue inhaler at a time. But as others have said, rescue inhalers are not supposed to be used this much and long term over usage can actually harm your heart (this is what my doctor told me when I got diagnosed).(#6)As others have said, he needs a new controller/preventer medication. 

Anecdotally though, I live in the UK and I get two rescue/reliever inhalers per prescription (400 doses total). They're meant to last about 50 days or so. It's interesting to see how other countries do it. Here they prescribe two in case of the other running out in an emergent situation.(#7)Yeah that's not good. I know in the past when I've needed my Albuterol a lot, you're body builds a need for it. So I was using it every 4 hours for about 3 weeks and my body because very dependent on it. I got to the point where if I went 3 hours I'd feel like I was unable to breathe. I'd try to space the uses out little by little. If that's not helping I'd talk to your doctor about it.(#8)I had to come off my controler recently (and can't get back on it--or any other one--until I've had allergy testing, as I may have a steroid allergy). Since my doctor and I both knew that that likely meant my asthma getting worse and me needing my rescue more to keep it under control, he reminded me that UP TO EIGHT puffs per day are okay to use. And this is in a situation where I cannot take controller meds (was on a medium dose of inhaled steroids before I had to quit them, and my lungs got noticeably worse within two or three days of quitting).

Your partner should not be taking his rescue that often and he absolutely needs to get onto a controller med. Uncontrolled asthma like that can cause long-term damage to his lungs.(#9)What kind of doctor is he seeing for his asthma? 

10-20 uses of his inhaler a day is absolutely insane. If he isn't seeing an asthma specialist, he needs to make an appointment ASAP and talk about controller meds.

The fact that he's been routinely prescribed and using this much without some kind of intervention before now is wild. I'd wonder what the GP has tried to tell him before cutting him off.(#10)If he is a heavy user of pro-air - more than twice a week, his asthma is not in control and he needs to see a doctor about getting on a controller med.

It was never 3 inhalers for a month. It was 1 inhaler per month for 3 months. That has not changed.(#11)Does he have a nebulizer? If he is using an inhaler that much he definitely needs one. I hope he gets better.(#12)I'm from/living in California and I don't remember being able to get more than one Ventolin at a time. I would just end up having more than one because they accumulated. But its so weird that they wouldn't at least give him an extra one just in case he needed to stash one somewhere!(#13)That's really interesting.  I live in California and for some reason my doctor only gives me one refill at a time. I've had asthma my entire life and this is a concern I deal wit). Of course the dr didn't get back to me with an answer why:((#14)Ask for an Albuterol Nebulizer in addition to his rescue inhaler."
Weezing when inhaling or exhaling through nose or mouth ?,4,0.75,15,"(#1)Anyone can make themselves wheeze. it's especially easy with the nose because of the shape of the sinuses coupled with any congestion.(#2)I‚Äôve had that happen but it was more of a whistle in the nose and it was due to nose inflammation from a dry environment(#3)I have a constant wheeze on exhale but nothing on inhale.

I find it so interesting how we all wheeze in different ways yet it's just as awfully annoying no matter which way we experience it.(#4)Wheezes are caused by constriction of air passing through something. If your nose is overly congested or your throat swells a little, it can cause non-bronchoconstriction wheeze.(#5)A wheeze in your nose isn't a sign of asthma. You may still have asthma, but that's not a sign of asthma."

What would you do?,17,1.0,19,"(#1)Look after you. Your health come first. Explain this to them. If they want more memories in the future best to have it when you are all breathing clearly. 

In a similar pridicament myself having go travel quite far to stay with inlaws that have 'an ourdoor' cat. 
I have a plan B with the neighbour luckily.

Do what's best for you.(#2)I think you should sit down with your partner and talk to them about this. I would imagine they would be understanding and want to spend Christmas with you and change their plans(#3)I have the same situation coming up next week. If my asthma would be okay right now, I would go because i would know that the possible worsened breathing would stop when I leave the house.. I would manage for 24 hours.

But right now Im on prednisolon too (thank you freezing cold -30 degrees here in Finland and after that  rain and 99% air humidity) and I have hard time even at my own home. So Im starting to think I won‚Äôt go. I think that at this situation it‚Äôs oküòÅ(#4)I had a similar situation with my own parents' house. They had cats, dust, mold, mildew, junk, etc., and one time I went there for some kind of dinner after having gone through a pretty bad exacerbation. Well that *one* visit triggered a really bad asthma attack that sent me into a health spiral for the next six months. I told them that on the advice of my doctor, I would not/could not go back there for the foreseeable future and I didn't go back for probably more than a year. They understood.(#5)Don‚Äôt go. You have to look out for your health first. They may try to guilt you into it, but no one who isn‚Äôt an asthmatic would understand what it is they‚Äôre asking of you. Stay home, you won‚Äôt be able to stay anyhow. At best you have to leave due to it flaring up. In no way are you the asshole. They are asking you to put your health and safety at risk for the sake of ‚Äúmemories.‚Äù

Frankly though, I don‚Äôt think your kids and husband should go either. Even for someone without asthma‚Ä¶ the hoarding, uncleanliness, and mold is unsafe. None of you should be going into that house, just because they‚Äôre family doesn‚Äôt mean you have to bear the weight of their carelessness. It would also lay down that you are a joint unit who won‚Äôt put up with them putting anyone in your family‚Äôs health at risk for their comfort. It‚Äôs a good boundary to have and one I think is well needed. May take a bit but they‚Äôll eventually cave and adapt to that they have to see you guys outside their cluttered house.(#6)Personally, I would have your own family christmas where you can make your own memories.(#7)I refused to even go visit my own family during my recent bout of bronchitis, I fully support putting your health first in this situation. Anyone who doesn't understand and support that needs to remove skull from sphincter, they might also breathe more clearly as a result.(#8)I am recovering from an asthma attack and bronchitis.  I am also on prednisone and other meds.

Personally I wouldn‚Äôt stay in an environment that triggered me even for a short visit.  It is sad your partner isn‚Äôt more supportive.  Put yourself first.(#9)Are your in laws aware that the dust and/or mold in their house aggravates your asthma? 

I feel for you and honestly if they want to be the host of holidays then they should clear their house of these triggers. Not only for you but for your kids and family as well. Dust and mold is toxic. 

So honestly if I had the guts I‚Äôd tell them how much it bothers my asthma and if they‚Äôd be so kind to clean their house. If not I think your family should have your back and stay and celebrate with you at your house. It literally effects your breathing, you can‚Äôt control it and shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer because of it(#10)Stay home and recover.  dont go into a situation to aggravate your asthma worse . it will take you longer to recover and then you may end up with lingering symptoms . learned from experience üí™üèº(#11)If it's really important to you to see your inlaws, you could put on a kn95 mask and keep the visit short; less than an hour, maybe just a half hour. They might sing a different tune when they're faced with a visual of how badly this is affecting you. Invite them over to your place to continue the visit before you leave.

You'd also do well to take some antihistamines a few hours before you go. I usually layer Zyrtec and Claritin (cetirizine and loratadine) when I know I'm gonna be around a trigger. Make sure the two you choose have no interactions other than the fact they're both for the same thing.

If it's not important to you, ask your partner about it. It sounds pretty important to them if going without you is on the table. If it's not important to them either, keep the invitation open, and let the inlaws know you'll miss them this year if they can't come over.(#12)Here is what I would do (and I have done this). 

I would try avoid going there. If that's not possible:

1) 3 days before: start taking Claritin, 

2) 2 Days before: I would either switch to stronger maintenance meds (ICS+LABA from ICS alone) OR quadruple my maintenance inhaler dose. 

3) The day of: take Zyrtec or Benadryl 1.5h before the visit, and Albuterol 30min before the visit (this is on top of Claritin every morning that you should have been taking since -3days). Repeat Albuterol as needed, up to 2 puffs every hour. Under no circumstances should you stay over night. 

4) Try to limit the time there. As soon as you get home (this applies to both you, your spouse, and kids), take off clothes and either wash them on hot right away or stuff them in a plastic bag to be washed later. Take a hot shower and wash your hair. Take another benadryl and Albuterol puffs before going to bed. 

I've done this when visiting inlaws with cats that I had bronchitis inducing allergy to, before I started getting allergy shots. Allergy shots solved all my allergy induced asthma problems.(#13)Honestly it‚Äôs not worth risking an asthma attack. One bad asthma attack can set you off for months. Part of being asthmatic is knowing your triggers and avoiding them. Not worth risking it.(#14)Don‚Äôt go and be honest. I would just say my asthma isn‚Äôt good right now and have to be in my environment to avoid any triggers. If they don‚Äôt understand, that sucks but so does ending up at the ER on Christmas with a bunch of Covid and flu there. I‚Äôm still paying off asthma attack bills so I don‚Äôt risk it ever for my health and bank account lol!"
How long do people use Symbicort for?,17,0.96,42,"(#1)The reason you feel so good is because its working. I'm down to using it once a day but my symptoms will return if I stop it, altogether. I've been on Symbicort for 5 years.(#2)It's unlikely your doctor meant 'take it for 3 months and then your asthma will be better and you can stop taking it'; he probably meant 'try it for 3 months and see if it's the right one for you'.

Asthma is a chronic condition, and maintenance inhalers are generally for life (I mean there are exceptions, some people might only use one when they have flare up periods if they're very specific - like seasonal allergies; or sometimes people's asthma changes, including sometimes getting better over time, for example). 

You feel good because it's working. Asthma meds are all trial and error so it's pretty great when you find an inhaler that makes you feel good - the ideal of control is that you basically feel like you don't have asthma and if you feel you've got that, you've got a winner (I take a different steroid/LABA inhaler and you'd have to prise it out of my cold dead hands if you wanted to take it away from me; I don't feel like I have asthma as long as I'm taking it). But it's likely if you stop taking it, the inflammation in your airways will come back and you'll get symptoms again.(#3)I've been using it for over 10 years now on a daily basis.(#4)Forever is most likely my plan. So far it's been a decade(#5)Using it daily since my asthma resurfaced in 2016. No side effects. Doing well for me(#6)I've been on Symbicort since 2007, it changed my life.(#7)I‚Äôve used inhaled corticosteroids for years. It‚Äôs working. Don‚Äôt mess with maintenance drugs that work.(#8)Almost 10 years so far :) It does wonders for me!(#9)I‚Äôve been using it for about 12 years. I can run and work out and live life like I don‚Äôt have asthma. It‚Äôs wonderful(#10)Sorry to say‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a daily long term medication. It prevents symptoms from starting at all- that‚Äôs why you feel so great. You won‚Äôt feel so great within a few days of stopping :/ I would maybe call your doctor and discuss the ‚Äúwhys‚Äù behind the medication and any additional info/ good luck!(#11)I am 32 and have been using Symbicort for around 15 years daily. 2 in the morning 2 at night. And when my symptoms are aggravated I can take up to 8 a day. Just stay on it if the doctor suggests it. Or try getting off and if you decline just jump back on it.(#12)I plan to never stop using it unless something else amazing comes out(#13)FOREVER u use it FOREVER. Til you drop dead. If you stop the symptoms will just come back. I saw that you are worried about your fitness? Dw, I have the fitness to run marathons, play soccer and weightlift at a high level and I have asthma. You will be fine.

(As long as you take your medicine)(#14)I‚Äôve found it perfectly effective only as needed (which is often weeks apart), although I might be on the milder side. It essentially replaced and eliminated  my previous ‚Äúregiment‚Äù (ie chronic daily overusage of Ventolin).

I think there is some research suggesting its efficacy as a reliever in milder asthmatics over alternative regiments 1) reliever alone, 2) daily maintainer alone, and 3) reliever+daily maintainer(#15)My asthma is mostly triggered by seasonal allergies so I just use Symbicort in the spring/early summer and sometimes for a month or so in the fall. The rest of the year I stop taking it since it's very expensive. But if whatever triggers your asthma is still around, it will come back.(#16)I been on it for 2 years now(#17)Perpetually(#18)I‚Äôve been on it for years and if I miss more than two days (not ordering my refills on time), then I have severe symptoms and often a respiratory infection.(#19)I‚Äôve been on it for a year, if you stop the symptoms will probably return. I take mine twice daily at night and without it for a day or two and I‚Äôm back in the doghouse(#20)I'm prescribed twice daily but I take it at night only at the moment. When I feel a cold coming on, I increase to 2x daily. I've been on it for about 5 or 6 years and it works very well. My voice does get a little hoarse but I believe that is a side effect of it.(#21)I‚Äôm planning to take it twice a day every day for the rest of my life(#22)Until the VA takes it away and makes me use the cheaper Wixela that doesn't work nearly as well and keeps giving me thrush... Man, I hate the VA.(#23)Been on it for 10 years.(#24)Pulmonary doc said I would  never be off a controller med. Also have rescue inhaler/nebulizer treatment, antibiotics and steroids on hand as back-ups, because  the ER and ambulances are crazy here due to covid. If my peak flow starts to crash, those will keep me out of a crisis.(#25)Used daily for years (‚ÄòAubrey 3-4) then weened down to just albuterol(#26)Well I plan on staying on it forever lol(#27)I guess mine is more mild asthma and I basically use Symbicort as a rescue. It is quite rare now that I actually need to use it, as opposed to when I was on Ventolin (which was like crack cocaine for my asthma).

There‚Äôs some research basically showing that Symbicort can replace both 1)rescue and 2) maintainance meds without having to be used chronically/daily for milder asthma and I have found that to be true in my case."
Finally got diagnosed with Asthma after 6 years!,4,0.84,3,"(#1)Glad you finally got an answer.

I personally wear a mask which significantly helps because it warms and moistens the air. (A scarf, buff, etc can also be used.)(#2)Do your best to learn your triggers and avoid them. Wear a mask, buff, scarf over your mouth in cold weather. Hydrate and sleep well. Take your meds as prescribed even if you feel perfect.(#3)Hey there. 
I got my diagnosis yesterday. In my case it was just 6 months but i also feel like my body stopped being functional during that time.

Aggravated Symptoms From Colds (Last forever!),3,0.8,10,"(#1)I‚Äôll normally just do prednisone for 4-5 days! See if your doc will write a standing order you can fill when needed. I like to do a 40mg-30mg-20mg-10mg taper personally but ask ur doc what the best dosing would be!

I‚Äôd recommend getting checked out when you have a lingering cold though, it‚Äôs very common for asthmatics to develop bronchitis or pneumonia from them. I literally always need a zpack after a cold lol!(#2)Yup. Both my mom and I have asthma. Our entire family caught a cold (confirmed negative test so not covid) over thanksgiving and while everyone else recovered in 2-5 days we‚Äôre 2 weeks out and I still have the occasional wheezing and chest tightness and she‚Äôs still having coughing fits.

I‚Äôm on a lot of medicine already but I would definitely ask your doctor about some additional meds. For me when this happens I use my nebulizer 2-3 times a day and try to add in some afrin or Sudafed. If it gets really bad prednisone but luckily I avoided it this time around.(#3)I had bronchitis a few weeks ago, and still feel chest pain and shortness of breath. Even my ventolin was not working anymore, so now I‚Äôm on prednisone and it is helping so much! I know it‚Äôs not ideal to take that medication, but my asthma flare up has been constantly getting worse (to the point where I felt breathless all day long). 

Did you get better?"
What are your symptoms?,3,0.8,7,"(#1)I am an almost 60 year old severe asthmatic and distance runner. If I'm doing sprints, I'll use my rescue before sprints. If I'm doing a long easy run, I don't use my inhaler or need it.

You may want to try upping your Symbicort to twice a day especially if you are using your rescue more than twice a week (excluding exercise). 

If you are feeling breathless while on the treadmill, slow the machine speed way down. Your conditioning is not at a level where you can run a brisk pace.(#2)Sounds like you are doing very well and your asthma is well controlled. 

I've had asthma since I was a kid. Mostly excercise induced. It got worse from 17-23 as a result of me developing allergies. Then I started seeing specialist, got on Flovent and allergy shots which brought my asthma under control. After having two children I'm getting in shape and now excercise 2-3 times a week by running or elliptical. I also use Albuterol before intense exercise, and that's fine. I use Qvar (my maintenance inhaler) twice a day.(#3)Discuss with your doctor. I am NAD.

I would use your symbicort every 12 hours, as thats how long it's supposed to be effective, and consider adding one puff prior to exertion if you still find you are triggered by running.

Not all asthmatics have exercise-induced asthma, but it sounds like you do, and this is a typical presentation.(#4)I'm in my mid-30s. Lifelong athlete and lifelong asthma patient. Your experience is definitely not uncommon. I'm the same way. If I don't use my rescue inhaler immediately before or in the very early stages of intense exercise, I'll only make it a few minutes before I'm absolutely miserable.(#5)With me my usual is wheezing then i get a tickle in my throat then id start wheezing and it makes me cough , chest pain and when its severe lying down and wheezing and coughing for hours basically"

COPD is caused by either chronic and poorly managed Cystic Fibrosis, Bronchitis, Asthma, Bronchiectasis and Emphysema.

You should see an Allergy/Asthma specialist, work to cut down on your smoking and keep a symptom diary with onset and worsening information so you have talking points at the office. Smoking with any form of Asthma is only going to make it worse and increase the risk of getting COPD sooner, and even though non-smokers can get COPD from other causes, smoking is the leading cause of most COPD, especially heavy smoking. Get a chest X-Ray done. Vibrations are caused by fluid or secretions that rumble as air moves in and out of the airways. If you experience a pain in your side and it hurts to breathe, get to the ED.

[Pneumonia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204) often presents as a persistent heaviness to the activity of breathing and pain when taking a deep breath. This is related to parts of the lung being junked up and not clearing normal secretions properly.

[Pleurisy](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pleurisy/symptoms-causes/syc-20351863), a condition where inflammation between the occurs in the lining of the lung (the pleura), causes a rough scraping sound on inhalation and exhalation called a pleural rub. Have someone place their ear on the left side of your back and listen closely when you inhale and exhale. Though uncommon to be immediately painful, as the inflammation pushes in on the inside of your chest cavity and limits lung movement - it will become a very sharp pain and you'll be quite short of breath. 

Some pleurisy can also have fluid that accumulates between lining of the lung and the pleura, called a [Pleural Effusion](https://www.webmd.com/lung/pleural-effusion-symptoms-causes-treatments). If these effusions become severe enough, a [thoracentesis](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/thoracentesis) is needed, where the fluid accumulating is drained into a collection bottle after the pleural space is punctured with a collection needle.(#5)Stop smoking friend!!"

Showers triggering asthma?? (Please help!!),8,0.9,13,"(#1)Check the bathroom for mold(#2)Is chlorine a trigger for you? In addition to checking for mold you might try getting a shower head filter(#3)Check the bathroom for mold, make sure it's not just anxiety or ptsd from a past attack that may have been independent of the showering also. Lastly, take lukewarm, short or both showers since you can't do cold. Some people do get triggered by steam(#4)You might try turning off the fan. It's possible the fan is pulling more dander-filled air through the bathroom, causing you issues.

Ditto with the mold. If you can, paint everything with Killz paint once you've either found no mold or taken care of what you did find.

You can also vary the temperature, which might have an effect.

It's also possible the colder weather has brought a pest into your home, whether fleas, carpet beetles, roaches, mites, or ants/termites. Take a good look around during your cleaning and see if you notice any evidence of bugs, and make sure all your pets are current on flea meds.

Do you live with other people? Have any of them used new bathing products recently? If you share a bathroom, it's possible you're allergic to their new product, which is getting kicked back up into the air every time you shower.(#5)Have you tried cool/cold showers? Humidity from hot showers may be a trigger for you.(#6)It could be that steam and hot air are triggers for you. I am the same when my asthma is bad or I‚Äôm going through a flare up, and I find steam very aggravating. Taking a bath is easier. I always leave the window wide open too.(#7)do you or a friend or relative have another shower you could use to narrow down, whether it's the act of showering or your specific shower?

I don't do any heavy exercise and I take it off outdoors as long as I am not in a crowd.(#3)Just speaking for myself here of course but the only times I've had issues breathing in my mask is when I was having anxiety/panic attacks. Unrelated specifically to the mask but it happens sometimes. My asthma itself doesn't cause any issue with the mask. I of course prefer when I don't have to wear a mask but always wear one when I should. The cloth ones were particularly bad. Now I only wear surgical ones and I've got no issue with those.(#4)You could be having sensory issues with the feeling of wearing a mask too. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs the case but I definitely experience it, and trying a bunch of different masks to find a comfortable one was key(#5)It‚Äôs all about getting into your head and realizing that the mask is not affecting your air intake. And yeah. It‚Äôs hard. I will find myself coughing for that reason sometimes.(#6)I have SEVERE ASTHMA- severe, y‚Äôall. 
I also work in healthcare- I wear a mask for 9 hours a day EVERYDAY.
I‚Äôm 100% fine- I can breathe totally fine. It took getting used to, but it gets better.
What you might be experiencing is ANXIETY.(#7)If you genuinely can't breathe in a mask, this warrants further testing. I've seen people with severely decreased lung function able to breathe in them for long periods of time as an example. If there's nothing going on, it sounds more like a mental issue tbh.(#8)There are some n95 masks that are easier to breathe in than others.(#9)This is less about asthma, more about anxiety. I‚Äôve worked in the healthcare industry my entire adult life. I have severe asthma. A mask does not cause symptoms or reduce your oxygen saturation. Panicking and breathing heavily through your mouth however leads to an attack.(#10)I had covid in 2020. A mask is nothing compared to what that did to my lungs.(#11)For me it depends on the mask.
I can't breathe in the plastic surgical type ones, but the fabric three-layer ones (made according to WHO/CDC/UK NHS recommendations for fabric masks) I can breathe in easier than outside air. Cold/dry air triggers my asthma so having the fabric barrier reduces the irritation on my airways by warming the air first.
Also, making sure it fits comfortably. I have a couple that are too tight where I put the elastic too short so they crush my nose and sit a little snug against my chin meaning the air flow is not great and causes me to wheeze a little where it restricts my nasal passages. I just don't wear those ones unless I have my glasses on to hook it round. 

There is the annoyance of fogging up glasses though, not fun.(#12)I have a hard time wearing kn95‚Äôs, but cloth and surgical masks are totally fine. I know they don‚Äôt offer the most protection in the world, but it‚Äôs better than wearing nothing!(#13)When my asthma was so unstable I could barely manage a flight of stairs wearing a surgical mask made almost no difference in my ability to breathe. Lots of cloth masks made me feel like I was suffocating but never had a problem with surgical masks. I even wear them when I‚Äôm exercising outside in the winter to warm up the air and it prevents triggering and attack or when pollen counts are high masks have been useful for me. Definitely think it‚Äôs more of a mental thing. I have a friend who can‚Äôt wear them because she has panic attacks with anything that covers her face after her boyfriend tried to another and kill her. She tried to wear a mask and started hyperventilating saying she couldn‚Äôt breathe and passed out.(#14)After a couple hours I get a little light headed so feeln your pain..(#15)Lifelong asthmatic here. No issues wearing mask all day at work + commute. 

I also run in a mask with no trouble.(#16)It can be really hard. I really wish people would be more understanding of it. Many times I'll avoid places so that I'm not confronted about needing to put on a mask. Then people with very mild asthma use that as a way to avoid wearing a mask and then the people who actually can't breathe with one on suffer for it. It's really annoying. Not mad at a group of people or a person individually, just a little annoyed with the Karen's of the world(#17) I found cloth masks hard to breathe in. FFP2 ( i guess the closest is N95)? a breeze. Our case numbers went sky high so i switched from the tiny paper masks to these and honestly? no issue. 

i‚Äôve done 8 hr course days in them. i wear them on the train. I do it, and at first yeah its frustrating and irritating and hard, but‚Ä¶.hell if i‚Äôm gonna catch this bug, at least i‚Äôm throwing down every obstacle I can. 

I do it because there‚Äôs not a choice right now between me, my lungs and the risk of covid, since viruses in past have been some of my worst times.(#18)It's harder to breathe through a mask, bit that's just a discomfort. It doesn't affect my asthma (which is well controlled). I hate wearing a mask, so I avoid situations where I have to. I avoid indoor activities in places with other people. I online shop and sometimes order groceries online. I work from home. I excercise by running and walking outside. So in total I rarely have to wear my mask more than 1h/day total.(#19)Ive been thinking a lot about how asthma is related to anxiety. When i got into my 30s i had a slew of random health hiccups that all stem from anxiety. Lately have been reading more about placebo effects with asthma. anyway my point it that you may want to try and work on your mental health. sometimes decreasing stressors can go a long way in reducing health symptoms that seem unrelated. not sure if this will help you. but it helps me.(#20)I take my inhaler before putting it on. Then go about my day. It's really not a big issue. The mask screws more with my Addison's than it does my asthma.(#21)Covid is gonna do worse for your lungs than wearing a mask. What you have sounds like anxiety. I have super super severe asthma, and have had it all my life. Shit, I used to get winded sitting down. But I can wear a mask just fine for my 10 hour shifts. I know that anecdotal evidence doesn‚Äôt help, but I would make an appointment with your doctor about getting on some anxiety meds. Or at least to look at your lungs when you‚Äôre wearing a mask just to make sure. Also, as long as you‚Äôre vaccinated, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs super important to wear one as long as you‚Äôre not crowding others, and or are actively sick and going out into public without one. I‚Äôm all for masks all the time, but just avoid too much close contact with others in public before you get this figured out.(#22)Just want to say it's not just you, I have this issue as well. I've noticed that if the mask has a little more like space in it, it helps a bit. So the n95 type shapes or you can get little plastic inserts to put in cloth ones. I think the little extra space means the mask isn't quite as constricting which makes it easier to breath. Otherwise take breaks if you can. Wear it for an hour in your doctor's and then take it off when you go outside.(#23)I avoid whenever possible.  I don't care what people say, it definitely makes it harder to breathe. When the ""experts"" say it doesn't affect breathing, I highly doubt they're basing this on a population with serious lung issues like severe asthma.(#24)My asthma is different to yours so i‚Äôm only speaking from my experience , I have worn n95 masks and they seem a bit tough for me to breathe in so i wear surgical masks and sure it feels like i‚Äôm breathing the mask in as well but it‚Äôs better than nothing . Due to rules in the UK i work long hours and have to wear a mask so i have gotten used to it so it doesn‚Äôt affect me much . abut maybe it‚Äôs a trip to doctors for testing for you in all honesty(#25)Breathe through your nose. Take slow regular breaths. The anxiety a lot of people are talking about is hella real, and the change in pattern usually looks like faster breathing through your mouth. The mask shouldn‚Äôt physically impede your breath so much as to make it actually hard to breathe (depending on the mask of course) but if you‚Äôre breathing pattern is changed the anxiety really does change how you feel. 
I would recommend taking note of how you breathe normally without a mask, and then see what‚Äôs different when you put one on.(#26)Learn to breathe through your nose it will change your life(#27)I bought [these silk masks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092RMW7RF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_F2HJXF9A1SYPK0DMDR8F?psc=1) and they are very comfortable. And whenever it gets too bad, I take a moment and remove the mask for a breath or two.(#28)I'd recommend the WimHof Method.

Cold exposure therapy and breathing exercises.

Mind over matter. 

I can do a 3.5 minute breathe hold now.

..Still have asthma. But it helps alot! I work at a Hospital so I have to wear a mask all day. Every day.(#29)Snap üòïüòí(#30)Not sure what kind of mask you have but I found a cotton cloth mask is best. The paper ones make my breathing really bad.(#31)It doesn't bother me at all to wear a mask.(#32)Depends on the person, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs one-size-fits-all. Back in 2020, I wore a surgical mask for hours without issue. Mid 2021, I ended up with bacterial pneumonia twice. My doctor, a very intelligent doctor might I add, told me to take a break from masking since I was vaccinated. I did as she said and felt much better. Now I mask only for short periods of time (about two hours) and I‚Äôm fine with that.(#33)I don‚Äôt wear mine because I am the same way.(#34)i cant even tolorate one . asthmatics who say they can wear one are lying"
Diluted juice and asthma.,2,0.75,3,"(#1)I had to look up diluted juice. Sounds like you may be mildly allergic to an ingredient in it.(#2)Is it orange squash? My mum‚Äôs asthma is affected in a similar way. But she‚Äôs fine with the blackcurrant varieties.(#3)Allergy, probably.

Every doctor I've ever seen about allergies has emphasized that if you notice something making you ill when you eat it then you should stop eating it and tell your doctor, even if you've not yet had an allergy test to confirm."
Let's talk Christmas trees,1,0.67,10,"(#1)Christmas trees normally get moldy on the bottom because of the water they sit in, as well as the water they encountered before they were cut. They make me sick very quickly, almost within hours of being around them. I had trees for years and never thought anything of it till an allergist told me a few days before Christmas. Threw out the tree the day he told me and I got better. Haven‚Äôt had a real tree since.(#2)Sounds like you may have a pine allergy or the water may be getting moldy. I occasionally get a small potted pine and then plant it outside after the holidays.(#3)Southern hemisphere here.
I'm so allergic to pine trees, so we stick with an artificial one.
My previous workplace had a real tree in reception and it triggered my asthma so bad.(#4)Air purifier. I believe there's hybrid üéÑ.(#5)I mean 1 plastic tree that you use for years is prob better than cutting down several real trees as well as increased inhaler usage and such if you're worried about those things not to mention your health. To each their own just something to think about.(#6)It depends on the tree. From my experience not the specific species, but If the tree has been sprayed with chemicals. And they tend to get very dusty, dont have it too long in your Apartment.(#7)Yeah that‚Äôs why I switched to artificial years ago. If you miss the pine smell just burn a pine wax scent. I don‚Äôt miss a real tree at all. 

Personally I would get it out of your house as soon as possible. You could have tree or mold allergies."
Asthma got worse when will it pass,3,1.0,8,"(#1)In what way has it worsened? Your post is a little difficult to follow.(#2)Honestly it seems like you caused your lungs some irritation. It's not possible for me to tell you exactly how long it will last, but usually if I'm not ill with some kind of infection and my lungs have been irritated, it doesn't last me longer than 4-7 days. Please take your health seriously - if your breathing gets worse, your meds don't help you, or if you don't get better for several days, get seen by a professional!(#3)Watch Patrick Mckeown on YouTube"
Update on flare up & bronchitis,7,0.89,1,(#1)Good news.  The doctor added prednisone and told me to stay off work until Thursday.  She also prescribed a cough medicine to help me sleep at night.
Peak flow rises significantly after nebulizer. Is this indicative of the bronchitis? Would it still rise regardless?,6,1.0,1,"(#1)The nebulizer is usually just albuterol, so if it helps, it means you have asthma. Bronchitis is a totally different diagnosis. And yes, if it increases significantly, that means you need it."
Has anyone else asthma gotten randomly worse?,43,0.97,33,"(#1)yes mine has gotten worse lately. the past week i‚Äôve been battling it, so much mucus and coughing. started my action plan about 6 days ago and i‚Äôve have started to feel better.(#2)Yes, biologics helped a lot. It took a few years to get diagnosed appropriately. I‚Äôm finally accepting my new normal is routine use of a nebulizer. No one ever warned me my mild asthma could become severe. It was surprising to say the least. Such is life(#3)For me living in North East when the seasons start to change my asthma usually tends to be worse, but does eventually get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.(#4)My asthma is fine but my allergies are totally out of whack(#5)Oh my god yes! Mine got randomly worse in July and same as you, all my tests are coming back normal but some days are fine and other days are terrible. I‚Äôm on symbicort 3 times a day + using sooooo much ventolin but same thing - they don‚Äôt work as well as they should. My doctors and I can not figure out what is happening or what is triggering it, it‚Äôs maddening. If you find something that helps you please let me know! Hope you start feeling better soon x(#6)Mine has been getting progressively worse for 2 years now. Constantly symptomatic though no massive flares. My pulmonologist thinks I have neutrophilic asthma, which is why it isn't responding to any treatments. I used to just have exercise induced asthma so I'm not sure what happened that caused things to go off the rails.(#7)Yes, this happened to me before I was put on inhaled corticosteroids maintenance meds. After that it's much more consistent unless I have exacerbation from respiratory infection or severe pollution. Talk to your doctor about it.(#8)Bro literally same(#9)yep , this summer i noticed a decline . i was outside came back inside had this coughing fit thought nothing of it . few weeks later had this flare up , after the major symptoms went away i still had chest pain and a minor cough made an emergency appointment was put on flovant 250 fha , THEN like few months later i developed hay fever(#10)Flutiform was the only thing that stabilised mine.

Oddly also getting fitter, raising my VO2 max. Gradually like a baby. I started walk round the block. Then a bit longer. Then BW exercises low volume, then a few more. Cleaned up diet. Tons of turmeric, ginger, and patience. 

It could be series of infections mild, a few around oct - maybe not used to mixing with people. Sorry you having issues. 

Have you tried meditation much. Or ASMR with headphones as a habit?

Since my baby workouts I have dropped weight, had more energy and able to ""live"" life a bit easier with less infections. I have one now tho if it makes you feel any better :) Antiboitics.(#11)Mine is very up and down - it was bad for months in the spring because I have tree pollen hayfever and I live in an area with quite a few mature trees. Better in the summer and early autumn then another dip in November. It's super frustrating.(#12)Yes mine got worse in the same period. The fires in California and increased smoke in other  contexts (a neighbor smokes and it seeps through).(#13)Yes, I am struggling so bad in finals season. I keep getting prescribed steroid pills in addition to the Singulair and steroid pump that I already take and its not working so I have to go to specialist(#14)Yes! My son and I both oddly enough were put on Flovent around the same time. We develop a chronic cough out of no where. No known underlying illness. The Flovent has Ms m done wonders.(#15)When it's getting colder, it gets worse, thats normal. Dont forget how much caffein can help you. Before I use my emergency inhaler I have a coffee. 
When your medical data is checked and good, think about Hyperventilation. I somethimes have ""mechanical"" trouble breathing because of tensions in my back and the wrong kind of breathing. Try to breath in your stomach. If it gets really Bad, breath into a plastic bag.(#16)The connection to cold i think is people burning firewood and fires. 
Also, agriculture like sugar cane fields burning is a big trigger(#17)Yea this whole year has taken me back to being a teenager. Blowing through inhalers weekly, constant shortness of breath.. nothing seems to help. I‚Äôm bout ready to buy some clenbuterol or anything to get things somewhat under control. 

I hate to say it but for me having to wear a mask all the time has weakened my lungs and fucked with my asthma so much. So much me dr thought I had covid in the summer when it was really just my asthma. üòû(#18)I'm not even sure if I have asthma but since the weather has changed I've been having difficulty so I got an inhaler(#19)yeah I can't get why, I'm not going outside, all I can assume is  its because I've put the heating on in the winter and there's dust in the radiators but we vaccumed back there to try to prevent that and I'm still wheezy. I don't normally get this unless I'm outside or at least until the spring(#20)Mine got worse about 6 months ago, when I‚Äôve been mostly very mild my whole life. I am now on Alvesco since I have been going through albuterol inhalers in under a month. I was wondering if maybe I got COVID but was asymptomatic because I‚Äôm vaccinated and that explains it.(#21)Wasn‚Äôt told I have asthma until 2020 but mine has definitely gotten worse and fluctuates. There will be a few days where I can barely breathe at all and have almost gone to the hospital then others where I‚Äôm pretty fine. It‚Äôs aggravating and scary. Last night I didn‚Äôt sleep at all bcuz of it. I think weather fluctuation is a huge part(#22)I‚Äôve had the worst flare up of my life this past Sept-Nov. It‚Äôs been awful. Just barely recovering now.(#23)Mine has been getting worse for a few weeks. I think it has to do with it getting colder out and the holidays I tend to eat like crap. I have ‚Äúintolerances‚Äù to wheat, eggs and I avoid sugar and seed oils. I am able to control it with diet and the lowest dose of daily steroids. One puff of 44 mcg of Flovent. Now that I started eating bad. I‚Äôm needing my rescue 2-3x a day. Has your diet changed or are you possibly around a trigger that you are unaware of ?"
Can I drink as an asthmatic?,4,0.84,20,"(#1)Yes? Lol ive never heard anything about asthma and alcohol.

Btw good filters/ ice (or those water beads) in a bong are MUCH easier on the lungs. If you're doing shots and smoking, it makes life way easier.(#2)What I've seen people say online is that certain alcohols like beer and whisky can trigger asthma symptoms for some people. But vodka and tequila are still good for me!(#3)I don't but back when I used to it was fine 

Same  with weed never bugged me but I'm on the milder side of asthma(#4)You can drink. If you have gerd issues take some medicine before hand so it doesn't aggravate it too much. It bothers some people a bit but nothing you can't manage and may not bother you(#5)Usually, there will be no problems. But wine (sometimes) irritates me. It appears that wine contains histamine, so if you have allergy-induced asthma (like I do), don‚Äôt over do it unless you make sure you‚Äôre ok!(#6)I've never heard of anyone having a reaction when drinking alcohol. I imagine weed is higher risk than alcohol though(#7)Bro i can barley smoke weed man . how you do it ?(#8)Yes(#9)Some of us have asthmatic reactions to alcohol. I didn‚Äôt until a few years ago. At this point I can‚Äôt even have clear alcohols, though they used to be fine. An antihistamine before can help. If you‚Äôve never drank before, maybe have a few sips and give your body a bit to decide if it‚Äôs going to react. If it doesn‚Äôt, go right ahead!(#10)I have pretty reactive asthma and I'm able to drink (ciders, wine, non-wheat containing alcohols work best for me). I just have a sensitivity to wheat so I can no longer drink beer unfortunately. Go for it! 

LPT: Pace yourself, drink it slow.(#11)I do drink and honestly I feel that it mostly helps me actually..I feel better.(#12)When my asthma is flared up, alcohol definitely effects it as in makes it worse. It usually doesn‚Äôt stop me from having a drink but I notice it for sure and have to use my rescue inhaler.(#13)dude.. don't smoke weed. Eat it in a cookie but don't fuk your lungs up more, you don't want to get COPD(#14)I‚Äôve never had an issue with it. Sometimes I actually find it helps reduce anxiety associated with asthma. I do stay away from red wine though as I believe it has sulfates that can affect asthma."
Bronchitis,4,0.84,9,"(#1)I had bronchitis once dood I got put on antibiotics for a week I think and it went away after some time just spit out the pleghm shit so you can breath better and drink lots hot tea with no caffeine I have asthma too and it works(#2)There were a few years in a row where I got it once or twice a year, it‚Äôs the worst. I was using my rescue inhaler every four hours and still couldn‚Äôt breath, so I had to get antibiotics and a nebulizer treatment at my doctor‚Äôs office.(#3)Currently dealing with this. I'm on a nebulizer to treat it(#4)See a doctor.  

I was diagnosed with bronchitis a week ago and put on medications.  I am going back today as it is still lingering.(#5)Nebulizer and 5 days of steroids usually does it for me. I've gone from being unable to walk up the stairs in my house to playing a football (soccer) match in 6 days. Hope you get well soon(#6)I‚Äôm curious What are your symptoms? I also have smth since 2 weeks, breathing is normal but I feel like my lungs are on fire most of the time. So no need for ventolin but a really bad feeling of inflammation which doesn‚Äôt go away"
How much do Americans pay for an Asthma pump without insurance ?,6,0.88,20,"(#1)Like an inhaler? What kind do you mean? Albuterol rescue inhalers cost anywhere from $40-70. The long term use maintenance inhalers can cost over $200, sometimes over $500 but manufacturer programs and patient assistance programs are available and doctors often have samples for newer ones.(#2)Damn...I would have died years ago if I lived in America. How is it possible to afford medication?I'm on SO much medication and get through multiple rescue inhalers each week so ¬£10.81 per month for everything is an amazing deal. Thank goodness for the NHS(#3)[deleted](#4)Where I live, in South Texas, expect about 50-75 dollars for Albuterol(#5)$18 for my rescue $215 for my maintenance luckily I live pretty close to the border so I‚Äôve been able to drive down to Mexico to get cheap meds.(#6)Flovent is around $100/month and my rescue is  around $100.(#7)w/o insurance my symbicort is $400 in california with good rx(#8)My ventolin is usually around $20. I use Goodrx and shop around.(#9)My insurance doesn‚Äôt cover Breztri so without the zero copay card from the manufacturer it would cost me $576 for my maintenance.(#10)I use to pay $80 for albuterol but when covid hit it all of a sudden became cheaper. $26 then $18. Now i have insurance and it‚Äôs free for my preventative inhaler too :)(#11)For Symbicort  $350
For albuterol inhaler $125
For albuterol nebulizer capsules $400 a box
For nebulizer $300(#12)$500 no insurance, ~$50 via GoodRX, $5 with very good insurance.(#13)Flovent HFA is $400/inhaler for me and around $125 for ProAir. My insurance is terrible this year. With somewhat better insurance I was paying $200 for Flovent and $75 for ProAir.(#14)My advair is $300 + a month. WITH insurance.(#15)I think I pay 80 or so for an inhaler and for simbicort about 300? Fucking horrible.(#16)a lot(#17)About $50 for albuterol.

Over $100 for generic advair"
Asthma flare up but peak flow and oximeter read fine?,3,0.81,15,"(#1)This is so interesting I was just wondering if the ""zones"" were an accurate representation of a flare or attack. I have bronchitis currently but my peak flow or FEV1 cab look normal while my lungs are screaming 


Anyway I think you should visit the doctor if you're short if breath(#2)Flares can really set you back. I would see a doc to be sure they're good and ask how to support your lungs during recovery.(#3)It‚Äôs definitely a positive sign that your ox and peak flow are close to what they should be, but if you are out of breath a lot, you should see a doctor. Measurements are a good indicator of where your health is at but treatment should be led by symptoms, so if you aren‚Äôt feeling good then best get checked.(#4)Yes, see a doc.

Also, did you get a covid test?(#5)my peak flows don't really change much, asthma in small airways. Also sometime you can have anxiety or hyperventilation syndrome going on as an asthmatic.(#6)When my asthmas at it‚Äôs worst I still often read 95-97 lowest I‚Äôve seen is 93. I don‚Äôt get it. Like how can I not be able to breathe yet be getting enough oxygen??

Talk to your doctor and see if you meet the qualifications for mAb treatment.(#2)What mAb are you talking about? Asthma specific ones? You'd have to have very severe asthma, multiple admissions to hospital, and multiple/continuous use of oral steroids. Depending on the type of mAb it is you would also need blood work that supports it. E.g. Xolair requires a certain amount of IgE in the blood."
Can I take an extra day of pred? Still not right but getting there after two nights in hospital.,9,0.92,9,(#1)How long were you on them? With prednisone it should definitely be discussed with your doctor but I don't see why they wouldn't let you stat on longer if that's what you need. Alot of times with prednisone the length of time matters more than the dose..(#2)Steroids are powerful and can really mess you up (and save your life!). Talk to your doctor.(#3)Don't mess with oral steroids by yourself. Speak to your doctor.
Are all inhaled steroids the same? Did you find one that works better than others?,9,1.0,16,"(#1)with me i am on flovant 250 fha i find it works well i havent had a flare up since my last one , however since the dose is 250 sometimes i take one puff daily cause i ‚Äú feel better ‚Äú and then randomly out of no where worsening symptoms would start but over all the inhaler alone does its job and i havent fell ill since !(#2)No they are not all the same. For the same reason there are dozens of blood pressure meds. Not every body is the same and different people may respond differently to the same med. Some inhaled steroids have long acting bronchodilators in them, some are just inhaled steroid, etc. If one doesn't work for you, another one might work better.(#3)Adding in that some folks have different side effects from different steroids.(#4)They're not the same. If they were, they wouldn't be called different things.(#5)[deleted](#6)Different ones have different combos of meds.(#7)I've tried a few different combo meds, but Advair works the absolute best for me, combined with daily allergy meds. If allergies cause your asthma, it's worth getting an allergy test and taking a daily allergy med - I take Claritin in the am and Flosane in the pm. Using those, with Advair, I barely ever wheeze anymore at all.(#8)My question is how can you afford this?"
Pneumonia and asthma,1,1.0,2,(#1)Grading of asthma is more complex than that. Speak to your respiratory doctor about it.

"I'm a Respiratory Therapist, AMA.",62,0.98,173,"(#1)I was diagnosed with adult-onset asthma a few years ago after being atopic for most of my life (previously without significant respiratory issues). How do you perceive adult-onset asthma and its outlook / treatment success vs. asthma that is present from a young age?(#2)I'm an Australian living in the US still trying to work out how the US health care system works.  I've been newly diagnosed with Asthma.  If I wanted to visit a Respiratory therapist to work out a better plan without being referred by a doctor could I.  Assuming I was happy to pay out of pocket.   The doctors don't give me any useful information, they just keep doing a spiral of use your puffer, well how and when.  Just you know when you need it.  OK but how do I know when I need it.  Well when you need it that's when you need it.  Freaking round and round never answering my questions directly BS.  So the idea of paying to see someone that would just sit down with me and explain my test results to me and what they mean, how and when to use a puffer, teach me some exercises to help, you know the practical stuff beyond here is a diagnosis and some drugs sounds great.   Is that something I could pay a Respiratory Therapist to do?    Edited to add.  Sorry this turned into a rant I had another unsatisfying doctors visit last week that's still bugging me.(#3)Is covid especially dangerous for asthmatics? I know we are not more likely to die of covid, but, seeing how covid damages the lungs even of healthy people, is it likely that it might worsen the asthma?(#4)I am a life long asthmatic and I have a question about exacerbations and exacerbation plans. Why don't all doctors create an individual asthma exacerbation plan for every patient? And side question, why don't more doctors recommend that asthmatics get nebulizers to keep them out of ER (my nebulizer had kept me out of ER so many times I've lost count)?

Asthma exacerbations are a fact of life. You get a respiratory infection, bad allergy, or smoke exposure and even asthmatics with well controlled asthma would get exacerbations, where normal maintenance meds just don't cut it. The thing is, there are fairly easy ways to control those exacerbations if you just have a plan. 
I've created an exacerbation plan for myself based on my own research, past experience, and a suggestion from my friend. 

1. If I get a respiratory infection or there is wildfire smoke in the air, I switch from my regular maintenance Qvar to Dulera (ICS+LABA combo, I get one a year for exacerbations only), and start using Albuterol as needed. If I have congestion I use Flonase to prevent postnasal drip from causing bronchitis (this is from urgent care PA's suggestion).  This usually prevents my cold from developing into bronchitis. 

2. If that's not enough, I get my nebulizer out, and use it up to 4 times a day. 

3. If that's not enough, I go to urgent care and ask for antibiotics and/or oral Prednisone. 

4. If that's not enough it's ER time. 


What I see in this sub is a lot of people who are saying ""I'm having an exacerbation and my regular meds aren't working, what do I do?"" They all should have exacerbation plan. They should know what to do if their meds aren't working, at least until they can talk to or see their doctor. ""If A happens do B, if that doesn't help do C."" etc. 

Why aren't doctors more proactive about making sure their patients have asthma exacerbation plan? And why don't they recommend that most of their patients have a nebulizer at home to use during exacerbations (they are around $50, and drugs for them are dirt cheap compared to inhalers)?(#5)I take Montelukast and Symbicort(2 puffs in the morning and 2 in the evening ,I don‚Äôt use a spacer). I don‚Äôt have asthma attacks in the way that I can‚Äôt breath and I have to take ventolin for example BUT on the other hand I feel every day like my lungs hurt I don t know how to explain it maybe like on fire a little especially when I wake up in the morning and late at night. So is it a different kind of attack compared to the classical ‚Äúcan‚Äôt breathe‚Äù? It just feels like they hurt almost all the time but I breathe normally. Shouldn‚Äôt the montelukast take care of this inflammation part or do I need a third type of med?(#6)Hi! Thank you for doing this. 

I have awful allergies & am now getting allergy shots to treat those, but the inflammation & congestion has been out of control causing sinusitis & now a chronic sinus infection (I‚Äôve been on 4 different antibiotics in the span of about 3 months). My allergist is a huge help in trying to treat it (doing blood work, having me get a CT, suggesting different med combos to help clear it up & manage symptoms), but I‚Äôm curious why having a sinus infection seems to sometimes make my asthma worse? I‚Äôm used to it with having bronchitis or a chest cold, but haven‚Äôt usually noticed the asthma getting worse during sinus infections until recently. 

Also, other than taking my regular meds (Advair HFA with a spacer for maintenance & Ventolin HFA for a rescuer inhaler), is there something I can do to help prevent my asthma from getting worse when I‚Äôm sick?(#7)How is asthma severity determined after a patient undergoes a pulmonary function test?(#8)What causes breathing to be rapid and shallow?  When I get exposed to a trigger, it seems like my breathing gets screwed up before my peak flow drops or my airways are even actually constricted.  It always seems weird to me why I just automatically start breathing like that.(#9)I should stop reading Reddit straight out of bed without my glasses because I read the title as 'I'm a repisiratory theorist' and I thought you were about to hit us all with your theories about how asthma is a govt plot.

But no, what you're doing here is far more useful. Carry on c:(#10)I wish there was more awareness about what asthma is and a way to get it out to people who aren't diagnosed. 

I've had asthma (not severe, usually exercise induced) all throughout childhood and I didn't find out until I saw an AskReddit about running. 

I was 28, asked my boyfriend (former track sprinter) and he said what I had was not normal. 

I thought everyone hated running because they had to train their lungs! Nope. Feeling like your chest is on fire is not a universal occurrence. 

It also explained the wheezing when my allergies were bad, or why my lungs were always ""itchy"" after I was cleaning.

The first time I ran using an inhaler preemptively was an unforgettable experience. I wasn't *uncomfortable* at all. I could run all damn day if I wanted.(#11)Why do I always get so sick multiple times as soon as it gets colder outside and what can I do to prevent that? I take foster inhaler twice a day so far (only once a day in summer) and started taking vitamin D as well...(#12)Hi. I have severe persistent asthma. I‚Äôve had it since childhood and am now 48. In my 30s my asthma calmed down significantly, but then I got pneumonia 6 years ago, and haven‚Äôt been the same since. The last six years of prednisone and bad choices have led to significant weight gain. I know losing will help my asthma. Do you have any dietary recommendations for someone like me? I produce lots of mucus. I haven‚Äôt seen a big difference with dairy, but avoid excess lactose for other reasons. I would appreciate your professional opinion. I don‚Äôt have any food allergies.(#13)I've had cold- induced asthma as well as sports related asthma (I get out of breath easily - I think this is what it's called) since I was a baby. 

My parents both smoked cigarettes in the house. I moved out when I was 18 and started smoking weed daily for about a decade. I don't smoke now and haven't smoked for about three years. Prior then that I cut down to once a week. 

In the past three years or so I've been hard of breathing every one in awhile. My asthma drs think it has to do more with my anxiety than my asthma since my peek flow doesn't go down when I have episodes. Is that a fair assumption? Do you suspect it's asthma related, COPD, anxiety? I've never been into cigarettes. Maybe have about 10 a year in social situations.

Thanks!(#14)I have been struggling to get a full, deep breath since September. In the past, I have had at most 1 or 2 ‚Äòattacks‚Äô a year. On those occasions , the Salbutamol helped directly. Now I have been prescribed;

Salbutamol (4x day)

Symbicort (2x day)

Prednisone (finished 5 day course)

Ativan (ran out)


2x to ER, clear bloodwork, Xray, Ddimer, Covid, and CT.

Nothing is helping at all. 

My chest hurts. I have been referred to a respiratory specialist now.

What else can I do? I‚Äôm so upset and concerned about taking so much medication.

Thank you very much.(#15)What in your opinion is the most prevalent cause of why people develop asthma in the first place? 

I know that no one really knows what causes asthma, but most experts put it down to either your genetics linking to the genes you inherit from your parents or environmental causes such as pollutants and irritants in the air possibly leading to things like occupational asthma.

I'm doing a research project on this, and I would like to know your view.(#16)Hi! Thanks for doing this. I‚Äôm curious about the connection between GERD and asthma. If you control your GERD, will the asthma go away? Are there breathing exercises I should be doing? 

I have never been asthmatic. Recently, after a ton of stomach issues and a diagnosis of GERD, I got costochondritis and started having breathing issues. I‚Äôm now being treated for asthma as well (advair 2x daily) and it‚Äôs helping.(#17)Hi yes, I would like to return my asthma. It‚Äôs alright but I don‚Äôt think I need it.(#18)I am getting good medical care but thanks for offering to help.(#19)I don't have any questions at the moment, but I just wanted to sincerely thank you for all that you do. Respiratory therapists like you have been so kind to me over the years, even searching the hospital floors for a VEST machine for me. I think when I first got my VEST for home, a respiratory therapist was the one to show me how to use it. I get hospitalized quite frequently and I owe my life to many respiratory therapists.(#20)Asthma is triggered by change of seasons/temperature.   I end up congested and then sinuses drain leaving me coughing like mad and hacking up stuff.  I currently take 2 puffs of albuterol a couple mins a part and 2 puffs of Dulera after.  I do this twice a day morning and evening. Anything I should do different?(#21)My mobility issues are beginning to really affect my respiratory issues.  I can't stand long enough to clean my CPAP mask, hose, tank as I used to.  I need a quicker way to do these things, and not something only William Shatner can afford.  I know isopropyl alcohol was deemed not okay to use back in the day.  How can I quickly clean this stuff?  Can't stand at the sink at all now.  My nebulizer mask, too, probably needs a good clean.(#22)What are some good options for long term therapy for me with existing asthma but also recurring central serous retinopathy.(#23)what triggers adult onset?  seem like one day i woke up with asthma and never had as a kid. also how does other inflammatory disorders affect  asthma . i have a inflammatory arthritis and it seem like the same time that started i got adult onset asthma? thank you for your time(#24)How do you suction all that phlegm without losing your appetite? I work in a hospital as a transporter, and I go to RRTs and code blues. I can handle every bodily fluid and smell, but I'll be damned if phlegm doesn't gross me out.(#25)I was diagnosed as an adult a few years ago. I am on Breo, ventolin, and sometimes Incruse, with antihistamines and Mucinex as needed. 

It still feels like I can‚Äôt get a good control of it - it doesn‚Äôt take much for me to have a flare up. Eg walking past smokers, being around chemical cleaners, and now dental work (chemicals). Wildfire smoke really does a number on me. 

It‚Äôs never to the point where it‚Äôs an absolute emergency but it limits what I can do and makes me miserable. 

Is there anything else I can look into / ask my doctor for? My gp won‚Äôt send me to a respirologist because she thinks I don‚Äôt need to be seen, and I‚Äôm on a wait list (a year) for an allergist.

She always says ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my lungs, it‚Äôs my throat‚Äù. When she is unable to get things under control using a rescue inhaler we have to go to a walk in clinic or ER to get a prescription for prednisone and she is usually right back to normal shortly after. She was diagnosed as asthmatic at a young age. Is it possible that she had a misdiagnosis at a young age and now needs to revisit some specialists to get a second opinion? 
She is currently prescribed a rescue inhaler and a daily discus steroid inhaler.(#28)Hi. On the lowest dose of the advair inhaler along with albuterol for rescue. Seems pretty good! I do have exercise induced asthma and am trying to get back in to running but getting frustrated with needing puffs or getting out of breath / high HR. I start my runs with 2 puffs of albuterol. Are there other treatments that can help? Is the advair exacerbating the HR issue? I‚Äôm not super in shape but also not super out of shape. It‚Äôs frustrating as I ran cross country and track in high school and am craving to run, but my heart / lung combo hates me. 

I do see lots of spacer suggestions in here. As a life long asthmatic I‚Äôve never thought I needed one. Hmm.(#29)Albuterol with spacer inhaler vs albuterol via nebulizer. What‚Äôs the difference?

Last time during a flare urgent care recommended nebulizer, allergist said just use inhaler with spacer as it‚Äôs not much different.(#30)So, possibly tangentially related to asthma, but definitely a question for a resperatory therapist:

Recently, when I wake up from sleep or take a deep breath after sitting/laying down for a while, I'll feel this kind of...""crackle"" is too sharp of a term, but similar...popping/bubbly? sensation as my breath expands to the full volume of my lungs. It's uncomfortable, and can cause me to cough, but not always. There's an element of forcing my lungs to expand against tightness, too, if that makes sense.  It's a pretty recent development (last few months) and not one I've ever experienced previously. I have had mild/moderate asthma since birth. Any clue what could be going on here?(#31)Hello, thank you for doing this AMA! 

I have been an asthma sufferer since I was a child and have lived for a long time without being bothered by asthma thanks to my medication. I made the mistake of starting to smoke cigarettes and then cannabis, which lasted 3 years. After a while I often had a little trouble breathing and a spot in my throat after smoking, so I would take my inhaler and go to sleep and it would go away. 

Then one day it was so bad that I thought I was going to die, and since then I have had constant chest tightness, throbbing, and the feeling that my chest is constantly swollen. It's often difficult to get a satisfactory breath. My pulmonologist increased the dose of my treatment but it didn't help and he doesn't want to see me anymore. 

Any idea what is happening to me? Blood oxygenation is perfect, chest CT and MRI show nothing special.(#32)What are your thoughts on the use of Symbicort on an as-needed or rescue basis instead of in maintenance? Anecdotally, I used to use a ton of Ventolin for constant wheeziness but very rarely have any wheeziness since using Symbicort (infrequently) instead of constant Ventolin/albuterol in addition to or alternatively with solely a daily maintainer like Flovent(#33)I diagnosed with asthma two years ago and symptoms were just mild. Summer season doesn't bother me but now it is winter season and after every 2-3 days, wheezing starts at night or it wake me up from sleep for 2 weeks. So, I take montekulast and wheezing goes away in 30 minutes. My question: is it normal for asthma patient or should I go to Doctor?(#34)Last week I started experiencing shortness of breath and chest pains while taking my son on a walk. At first I suspected allergies but my breathing conditions worsened. I went to the doctor on Tuesday and was tested for Covid-19, the flu, RSV, pneumonia and had a chest X-ray performed. The doctor found my lungs were hyper inflated, but could not find an underlying viral or bacterial  cause. At this point I had a CT scan done because my doctor was worried I may have a blood clot. No clots were detected. For the last 5 days I have been in bed undergoing high dosage steroids and breathing treatments every 4-6 hours. I‚Äôve had to have family come in to help out. Needless to say this has been a nightmare. My doctor suspects I‚Äôm having severe asthmatic complications but I have been referred to an allergy and lung doctor and will have some follow up appointments in the next 2-3 weeks.

This is very unexpected as I have never dealt with anything this serious since I was a child. It‚Äôs hard for me to even get up and walk around my house at this point.  Last Tuesday is when this all really started and I‚Äôm still having difficulties. What do you think is happening?

I should also note I moved from Colorado to the western Texas panhandle area and I‚Äôm wondering if that is having a huge impact. I‚Äôve been here for three months already.(#35)I was diagnosed with asthma in middle school is there a chance for it to go away in adulthood?(#36)Didn‚Äôt have asthma till I turned 40

Asking for help(#37)How can I get an affordable steroid inhaler. Flovent cost me $260 every 60 days.(#38)I‚Äôm a lifelong asthma sufferer. 30 of my 32 years to be exact. My maintenance regiment when things are normal is Singular 10mg  1/day, Symbicort 4/day (2 morning and 2 at night). Ventolin with chamber for rescue, seldom needed when under control. My asthma is set off by exercise, stress and the worst flare ups occur around getting a cold. My action plan when I have a flare up is to increase my Symbicort to 8/day and use my rescue inhaler as needed. Most of the time this works okay (not great but okay). When I get a flare up for a cold like I am currently on the tail end of as we speak I may have cold symptoms for 3-5 days but my asthma symptoms last for 2-3 weeks usually which is very annoying. I‚Äôve noticed that reaction from colds has been getting worse over the last few years or so. My current situation is I inevitably caught the cold that my kids brought home from school the week after Halloween the cold migrated from throat to nose to my chest within 3 days and my flare up began. I increased my Symbicort and I started using my rescue inhalers much more. I even found that I was waking up in the morning and needing my puffer first thing immediately as my chest was quite tight (I was using my rescue inhaler 4-6 times a day 2 puffs each time). Sorry for the long winded story‚Ä¶.
My concerns about my current state is that I‚Äôm 6 weeks in and still maxing out my medication and only now am I feeling like I‚Äôm getting back to where the maxing out my Symbicort plan is semi controlling it again even tho I still need my rescue inhaler before bed to sleep and maybe once during the day. I‚Äôve noticed this post cold asthma flare ups last longer and longer over the past 3-4 years and I‚Äôm not sure why. I‚Äôm worried about these flare ups that don‚Äôt get back to baseline for so long causing long term effects. I am only 32 years old and I become very complacent about my condition because I‚Äôm so used to having it but as I get older I worry about the repercussions I may encounter as I‚Äôm older if I don‚Äôt get it back into control quicker each time it flares up this way. I‚Äôm seeing my GP tomorrow actually and am going to ask to re-up my supplies for my nebulizer (which I used to use a lot more 10 years + ago when I had less control over my asthma but was told it‚Äôs excessive and should go to an ER if it‚Äôs that bad I need a nebulizer) do you recommend anything else?? Prednisone maybe if I have a flare up like this? 

On a side note I also feel because of this common cold induced asthma that COVID 19 would particularly hit me hard if I were to catch it‚Ä¶ any validity to that theory? 


Thanks for this post! I really enjoyed reading through everyone‚Äôs questions!(#39)For the past, two years-ish, my asthma has gotten significantly worse. I've had asthma my whole life and have gotten by just taking ventolin when needed, for the most part.   
It's much worse during the winter season, as I've read that seems to be pretty common. But the thing that's really getting too me is that it's especially bad at night. Sometimes during the day, like in the mornings, i'll have a coughing fit - but for the most part, I wake up in the night feeling like I'm being suffocated and then have to get up, take my ventolin, sit up for about an hour and cough until my chest feels loosened up, and by then  i feel like i've coughed so much i feel physically weak.   
So since all of this has happened, i've started taking flovent in the morning and in the evening aswell. Anytime I talk to my doctor his response is to just up my doses, always upping the doses - which that's another question of mine here - what are the long term effects of taking puffers for many years/your whole life, everyday ? I assume there must be some side effects ?  


And also, it's worth mentioning, I have two cats. That said, I've had one of my cats for 14 years, and growing up, I often has more then 2 cats and was on fewer puffers and had fewer breathing issues. I know cats are not great for asthma at all, but with puffers, cleaning my room, sleeping with a  humidifier on, washing my sheets weekly, hypoallergenic pillows, etc, I'm still waking up with this suffocating feeling. 

I'm wondering if you have any advice in terms of night time asthma that I can try ? I worry that I'll feel this way forever and it's so uncomfortable and really interrupts my sleep which inevitably really interrupts my day to day. Any thoughts are appreciated, thank you !(#40)My boyfriend just passed away from an asthma attack and I have all sorts of questions.

It's the underlying baseline inflammation in your small airways that's leading to the attacks that, over time, can really cause you problems [not a doctor].

If the underlying inflammation isn't controlled, often with a daily preventor even when you feel well, then the inflammation builds up and can lead to airway changes. 

That's how some folks with asthma get more severve versions when they're older. Or others can get COPD mixed with asthma.

Best to have an asthma action plan to prevent these long term consequences.(#4)Respiratory Therapist here, on mobile. I'm happy to answer any other questions you have as well.

The largest long term consequences come from attacks that increase in frequency and severity. Lung damage begins in the airways themselves gradually progressing the more often airways constrict (close down) from irritants and spasm (from frequent, forceful and ineffective coughing). If an attack does subside, be aware that it may simply be because the trigger is anxiety-related, or the exposure was brief enough not to trigger a full-blown event. That's still not good, though.

These are warning signs. Increases in nighttime awakenings from coughing and feeling intermittently short of breath are definitive of Asthma progression. See your doctor, get a peak flow meter and get an inhaler with a spacer if you don't already have one. If you need to use your inhaler more than 4 times per day (outside of more obvious triggers like exercise and cold weather exposure), it's time to begin Asthma controllers like LABA/ICS because you're going to desensitize yourself to your inhaler and you'll be in the hospital for attacks frequently. LABA/ICS are the safety net that protect you from needing your rescue inhaler often.

Ideally, the very most that you should use your rescue inhaler per day is 6-12 times depending on if you use 1-2 puffs (which is why rescue inhalers have so many doses). This is already quite often and means that you should be seen for progression.

Asthma can wax and wane with changes in emotional condition, energy level, nutrition, exercise and general fitness, environmental exposure, etc. Pay attention to the air quality on days when you're going to be outside more often, try to use your rescue inhaler with its spacer at least 15 minutes before going into the cold or beginning exercise if you know they are triggers.(#5)I don‚Äôt think there are any long term effects, happy to be corrected, but it‚Äôs very important that you keep your asthma well controlled and are vigilant about when an attack is worsening, then seeking emergency medical treatment.(#6)Scarred lungs"
Asthma Treatments,1,0.57,19,"(#1)I don't personally use Breo, but many of my patients do. Breo is a Asthma DPI (dry powder inhaler) controller medication that works well for people who have more well-controlled Asthma, are able to generate sufficient inspiratory force and also do better with taking their controller once per day. It is frequently used in the hospital for those who take Advair. 

As with all medications in dry form or containing an inhaled steroid, make sure to rinse your mouth out completely each time you use it. The same goes for Advair, Symbicort or Flovent. The steroid reduces local immune responses in your mouth, which normally prevent the growth of fungal species that normally populate there and the throat. As a result you get thrush (oral candidiasis) caused by Candida albicans.(#2)I took breo but woke up having an anaphylactic reaction several times in a month. I was also having allergic reactions to food that caused blisters in my mouth, and when the blisters burst, I would get thrush inside the sores, I guess from the breo getting in them and I couldn't wash it out well enough. The thrush stopped after I stopped breo. I'm able to take symbicort without those issues.(#3)I'm on Relvar Ellipta, which is basically Breo, and it's been fine for me.(#4)I am on it. I was prescribed it about 2 weeks ago. So far no ""bad"" side effects, other than slight drowsiness. It's also been working quite well for me. I've heard it can give bad thrush if you forget to rinse your mouth after the dose.(#5)Every asthmatic is different. Tbh if you‚Äôre taking it at the experiences of others instead of trying it, you may never find a daily inhaler that works for you. I‚Äôve tried multiple kinds of inhalers and I found symbicort was way harsher on me than any of them. I‚Äôve been on Breo for a year now and it is a godsend to me, only side effect I‚Äôve had is weight gain, though I‚Äôve found that with every inhaler. If your doctor is prescribing it, I recommend at least trying it before ditching it.

If you take it though, I find you do need to rinse your mouth more thoroughly with it. I usually rinse a full cup of waters worth to be safe as I‚Äôve had thrush and some sort of weird red spots in my mouth before, though my doctor didn‚Äôt say if it was related.(#6)My husband has severe asthma. Breo has been a god send for him. He‚Äôs been on it for about 5 years now with no side effects and he almost never uses his ventolin anymore, whereas before he was using it 2+ times a day.

Edit: autocorrect thought Breo was cheese(#7)Was given breo also !! I never took it either lmfao i was then given flovant and it works amazing(#8)I was on it in the beginning. Had no reactions, honestly for me wasn‚Äôt sure if it helped. Switched to Symbicort HFA with spacer and it worked a lot better.(#9)Breo gang. I use breo 100. It‚Äôs nice that it is once a day. No major side effects.(#10)I used to use Breo but my body kind of stopped responding well to it or my flair got worse and am now in Breztri. I liked the convenience of once a day.(#11)I use Breo and it works great for me. I remember being worried about taking it too. I tried Symbicort and Dulera before it and my body did not tolerate those at all. Also yes, it does give u thrush so always brush your teeth after(#12)I used BREO for a month and it was super fantastic‚Ä¶. For my asthma‚Ä¶.but I got deeply depressed, weepy and suicidal while using it.  Scariest month of my life.  I stopped, and a day later the dark cloud lifted and I felt like myself again.  I‚Äôm sad because it really did work for my asthma."
Exercise and cold induced asthma is so frustrating!,20,0.93,6,"(#1)Masks have been a real godsend for me. I wear them all the time outside when exercising as cold weather is one of my worst triggers. This is even more true when  cycling as cold wind is far more aggravating.(#2)Respiratory Therapist here. I hear this very often. While carrying your inhaler on you is always recommended, you should always preempt any obvious triggers to reactive airways such as extreme heat, cold or exercise, if you have a history with them. 

Take your rescue inhaler at least 15 minutes prior to exercising or entering the cold (if you don't have a spacer, get one - they help tremendously). The medicine will be in full effect within 5 minutes, which is 10 minutes before you start your ride. The effect should last about 4-6 hours depending on how often you use it.(#3)At least it gets me out of shoveling snow LOL

But for real, I'd rather shovel snow full time than be coughing and wheezing all night long like I have been lately because of the cold and my allergies(#4)Yeah, I get that. Recently we had a warm spell and I thought it was warm enough for me to try a jog. It was not. After 30 seconds it felt like my lungs were bleeding. During the summer the air is too humid and full of pollen, and in winter it's too cold and dry, so there's a very limited window of time in which I can get any exercise outside."

Asthmatics Tend to Breath Through Their Mouths; Slow Nasal Breathing Improves Symptoms (1-minute audio clip from James Nestor),21,0.86,11,"(#1)Or because of sinus issues. 

like, leave me to breathe my own way in peace. eeesh.(#2)Breathing through the nose moistens and warms the air entering the lungs, so if you have issues with dry or cold air, breathing through your nose really might help.(#3)Kind of hard with a deviated septum that insurance says is not medically necessary to fix.(#4)I almost died when I was two from asthma- it went undiagnosed probably for at least a year before that. I‚Äôve only ever breathed through my mouth. I can‚Äôt get enough air through my nose. Plus I have allergies as well. I hate the stigma that comes from being a mouth breather- I‚Äôm just trying to live here.(#5)I have been trying to consistently breathe through my nose, for a few years. I really think it can help. It's hard to breathe this way, but hard it that exercise thing they give you after hospitalization kinda way.(#6)Yeah‚Ä¶that‚Äôs because my sinuses are plugged up 90% of the time‚Ä¶(#7)Has anyone of you noticed that your inhaler unblocks your nose? 
I've been a mouth breather my entire life. Got diagnosed with Asthma last June and since then, noticed that I can breathe through my nose just fine after taking my maintenance inhaler (Fostair). Relly weird and I don't know whether it's the Formotherol or the Beclomethasone in there. I really appreciate it though. My breathing is also much more calm and I don't feel like suffocating anymore."
Breathing bad at night,5,1.0,4,"(#1)What are your triggers? It could be allergens, reclined position, or maybe colder air at night. My allergies cause postnasal drip to drip into my lungs all night making my asthma flare up. A warm steam humidifier helps when you're sleeping.(#2)Mine is acting the same way but I'm also sick rn. I was reading that if might have to do with cortisol levels and them changing at different times. 

Also congrats on that flow number. How did you get it that high!"
Ventolin inhaler went through washer and dryer,5,0.86,6,"(#1)I wouldn't, I'd ask a pharmacist about it.(#2)Water won‚Äôt hurt your inhaler, but if the dryer was on high heat, it could have damaged the canister. I agree with check with a pharmacist.(#3)Nope, don't use it. Even if you washed on cold, the high heat of the dryer would probably have denatured the medication. I would get a new one.(#4)Nooooooooooo(#5)Respiratory Therapist here.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say no. Like the other commenters here have said, the canister could be damaged or the inhaler's casing could be warped and not function properly. It's best to seek replacement right away. It might be possible to defect out a newer inhaler without charge, though I'm not sure. Talk to your pharmacist. Use the GoodRx website to get a significant discount on your rescue inhaler if you don't have the best insurance. I'm sorry that happened to you.(#6)No, are you daft?"
Why does my body have to be not normal,9,0.92,5,"(#1)That sounds awful. You have my complete compassion. Hope you get better soon!(#2)Are you on a preventer?

It was, in fact, the reason for the worst intubation experience and ICU stay of my life (""walking"" pneumonia turned out to be ""stay in the ICU for two weeks before getting transferred to general ward"" pneumonia).

Question,3,1.0,4,"(#1)I have asthma since birth. My body has always woken me up whenever i struggled breathing. Hoping this helps(#2)Something to talk to your doctor about. If you do have issues with your breathing stopping in your sleep, that would likely fall under [sleep apnea](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631) rather than asthma. If you're concerned about asthma attacks in your sleep, there are things you can do to prevent them (such as getting a humidifier, washing/changing your sheets frequently, not sleeping with pets, etc), and your doctor may be able to give you something if it's a regular issue."
Surely this is glitching out,7,0.81,11,"(#1)Your other 2 photos beyond the first are hard to see, remember that nail polish can cause incorrect readings. If you‚Äôre like me & got a cheap one off of Amazon I‚Äôd change the batteries or turn it off, take it off, put it on another finger, then try again & see if it‚Äôs consistent. If you‚Äôre having major symptoms & really worried, see a doctor!(#2)Had any caffeine today? The last pics are absolutely glitching, but the first is plausable if you're buzzed up on coffee. I'm severely out of shape and a caffeine addict, so my heart rate is rarely below 80 when I'm awake, usually in the 90s. 100-110 would be fine for me if I was feeling unwell or just sat down.

If you paid less than ~$25 for the pulse ox, I wouldn't really trust the readings. Also remember to sit completely still, breathe normally, uncross your legs, etc.(#3)Make sure your finger is not cold.(#4)I'm on adhd meds too if that helps(#5)I mean, it says your heart rate was 167 in one pic, so yes, I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs glitching out.(#6)FWIW, there are other measurements that are relevant as well. A peak flow meter is also useful to have.

My POx varies from 86-98 according to my Apple Watch during the last week. Yeah, I‚Äôve been around heavy allergens (cats and dust) so my asthma has been pretty bad.

It went down to about 82 when I had COVID-19. If I hadn‚Äôt been able to hack my CPAP machine and increase airflow, I would have probably ended up in the hospital, and possibly not made it.(#7)My best is 600, about 430 just now.

Do I have asthma?,3,1.0,4,"(#1)Make an appt with an allergist/asthma specialist. My cough variant asthma went untreated for three decades because of quack doctors who said I was fine. Wish I would‚Äôve known to go to a specialist sooner.(#2)Your average PCP, I've found, doesn't have a great understanding of what asthmatic lungs sound or look like. I went into the doctor once the day after an asthma attack, and my O2 levels were 93% (down from the 99% its usually at), my blood pressure was very high, and when my doctor listened to my lungs, she literally asked if I was a smoker they sounded so bad. She disagreed that it could be the previous day's asthma attack, because I wasn't \*actively\* having an attack. This was a year after my asthma diagnosis, and I had used my inhaler at the time, but the evidence, to me, was still pretty clear.

As someone who has had asthma attacks after chasing horses in the snow (and typically finds the symptoms go away on their own after a few hours), and has had doctors ignore my breathing concerns, I would keep pushing for evaluation and diagnosis.(#3)Asthma can't be ruled out based on an isolated stethoscope chest examination. Your symptoms are indicative of asthma and you should see a pulmonologist.(#4)Hey, that really sounds like asthma. Try to get checked out by a specialist. I have asthma and feel/sound normal when I am not having an attack. I think your doc dismissed this without a good reason and it can be really dangerous aswell. You can literally die if you get a bad asthma attack - very likely to happen if it aint treated"
Asthma and panic disorder,3,1.0,10,"(#1)I‚Äôm the same I‚Äôve got asthma and have bad anxiety, a lot of it is your anxiety making you feel like your short of breath but really you are not , also I focus on my breathing all the time and am constantly taking deep breaths and breathing in through my nose and out my mouth , it takes over your life , we just have to get it in our heads we are ok and we are getting plenty of air into our Lungs(#2)It sounds like you'd benefit from getting better management of your PD. Therapy could be very beneficial. Breathing dysfunction could also be playing a role here as well and can be managed by respiratory physiotherapy. 

Speak to your doctors.(#3)It can be both . One day i was stressed like crazy , woke up got coffee had an asthma flare , my mindset was in a very bad place , anxiety can make asthma act up(#4)I've been in the same boat recently. Had a panic attack when I was driving to the store because my chest felt too tight and I thought I wouldn't be able to breathe or I was dying. Have had a few panic attacks since then. For me, I will start breathing too much which can cause you to hyperventilate which is just a vicious cycle leading to panic. I'm convinced the two are linked, it's not just panic and anxiety by itself but breathing issues that trigger it and they feed into each other 
One thing that has helped me is buying a blood o2 meter, you can get a finger one or an apple watch with blood o2 monitoring. Even if my breathing feels bad I can check my blood o2 and see that it's fine which helps to calm the anxiety. Also if the blood o2 reading is getting high (99 or 100) that is a sign that you could be hyperventilating, basically over compensating for your breathing which is having the opposite effect and leading to hyperventilation and anxiety.
Oh and also, I don't know if you have this but I will get pins and needles in my hands which is also associated with hyperventilation and is another sign that you need to force yourself to slow down your breathing. Hope some of this can help."

Anyone having an asthma flare up this time of year?,9,1.0,22,"(#1)I hear you, I used to have them too. Then my asthma specialist had me tested for allergies. Turns out I was allergic to dust mites, cat, and dog. All indoor allergens. Once I treated those allergies with allergy shots and started inhaled corticosteroids, I no longer have winter exacerbations.(#2)Oh :(

It's good that you're slowly getting better, though.

I wonder which inhalers you use, if any.(#3)I have noticed them recently too and havent had to have an inhaler for a couple years now.

And no, it isnt the big C. I get a weekly PCR test and 2 LFT tests a week (work in a care home). 

I do however live somewhere that has been getting repeated storms, so the air humidity has been rapidly changing. 

Check your local weather for humidity changes to see if it's correlating? So much random shit can trigger it, maybe a room humidifier/dehumidifier? 

I'm hoping you get better quickly, but don't stress your body as much as possible. Physical rest is the best healer for my asthma, I hope that helps you too. 

Sending good vibes(#4)This time of year is always the most kind to me, the dry heat seems to ease my breathing. Winter and cold is my downfall.(#5)Yep. Just got out of a hospital where I was for 2 nights(#6)Yep!
I‚Äôve been experiencing my worst flare in a couple of years for the last 10 days. Just had to extended the prednisone taper. I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been out a bit more and likely got some cold germs. I turned 54 in November and we had about 10 ( fully vaccinated) folks over. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs where I got exposed to something. Those of course, go immediately to my lungs. 
I work from home too. Between the fatigue from poor breathing, the word prednisone energy bursts, and the GERD from the nebulizer it‚Äôs not fun. 
I have to travel for work Monday. Wish me luck ! I hope you are well soon."
Vomiting from Qvar,3,1.0,6,(#1)Have you tried using a spacer? Are you pregnant?(#2)Maybe thee powder is no longer good for you.
Attack sent me to the ER - suggestions?,16,1.0,22,"(#1)I think it‚Äôs pretty normal to panic in a life threatening situation.(#2)Best way to slow your panic is to slow your breathing. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Stay consistent with it even if you feel like you need gasp for air. You can put something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/DqK7H0S.gif) on your phone as well and use it.(#3)Hi!  I agree with everyone else that panic in such a situation is normal.

You mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/rc64wq/asthma_attack_sent_me_to_the_er_not_sure_what/) that you have Advair and albuterol.

If you ever need a rescue inhaler again, consider using Breo instead of albuterol.  It's significantly more expensive, but it works better.  Please see [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5480238/), table 1.  Its high specificity ratio means that it may be somewhat less likely to increase your heart rate and possibly make you panic more.  And its fast onset of action means it can give you quick relief.  Although Breo is not traditionally used as a rescue inhaler in the US, it's still a valid choice; see [here](https://pulmccm.org/review-articles/ics-laba-for-rescue-maintenance-asthma/).

If you're using Symbicort or Breo to treat an asthma attack, try [these tips](https://www.thermh.org.au/sites/default/files/media/documents/asthma_action_plan_symbicort_smart_symptom.pdf):  see the red column.  Wherever it says ""Symbicort"", you can take Breo instead, if that's your reliever inhaler.

If you only have albuterol, try [these tips](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321441) for an asthma attack.  There are also breathing exercises on that page which may be helpful.

It can be useful to practice doing some breathing exercises regularly when you're feeling healthy and good, so that they may be less difficult to remember if you ever panic.

If you happen to have a psychologist or therapist, you can discuss this with them too.  I have ADHD but currently don't have a psychologist :(

I'm not a doctor.  If your doctor contradicts anything I've said, please consider that I may have mistakenly told you wrong information.(#4)You need to talk to your doctor about exacerbation plan. Your were feeling tightness in and off for a bit, your were already having an exacerbation. You didn't say if you are on maintenance meds, but it sounds like if not, you should be. If you are on maintenance meds already, you need exacerbation maintenance meds. 

For example I'm on Qvar daily (ICS inhaled corticosteroids). 

1. When I have an exacerbation (from a respiratory infection or environmental cause like wildfire smoke) I switch to ICS+LABA (long acting beta antagonist) inhaler Dulera right away. This PREVENTS me from developing bronchitis. If I am congested I also use Flonase to reduce postnasal drip, which can contribute to me developing bronchitis. If there are environmental allergens in the air, I also start Claritin and possibly Benadryl at night. 

2. If that's not enough, I get my nebulizer out ($50 on Amazon and $5 Albuterol fluid that goes in it) and use it up to 3-4 times a day, that keeps me out of ER. I also take Mucinex to help me cough out mucus.

3. If I end up developing bronchitis anyway, I go to urgent care and ask for antibiotics and oral Prednisone. 

4. I know that if that's not working, it's time for ER. Thankfully I haven't had to do this since implementing my exacerbation plan.(#5)I‚Äôve been to the ER once for an attack. I was working construction and cutting drywall with out a mask because I was ‚Äútoo cool‚Äù for a mask. I was already starting to have an attack from running every on the job and my rescue just ran out and the drywall dust was the nail in the coffin. Then it all just hit. I couldn‚Äôt breathe and I felt like I was about to die. Sat in the ER waiting room for about 2 mins and then about 20 people came and grabbed me and put on a nebulizer. I was freaking out during the attack but after they got me stable I was fine. I booked the next appointment I could with an asthma specialist and got a daily and have been taking it religiously ever since.

It‚Äôs normal to freak out so don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself. Just always take precautions to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again.(#6)Meditation, mindfulness, yoga, breathing exercises, tai chi. It really works!(#7)It is a pretty scary experience, I have pretty severe asthma and an experience like that is always jarring (even the 10th time in my case lol). I recommend learning to spot the warning signs of an oncoming attack early, identifying any triggers around you and ALWAYS do your best to stay calm. I know its insanely difficult because when you can't breathe your brain immediately rushes to panic, just focus on slowing your breathing and make sure you have someone around you who can help. Having someone around, knowing what to do, etc. help mitigate a lot of panic (at least for me). If help is on the way or you're waiting for your meds to kick in, I usually ask someone to talk to me about something unrelated or I focus on counting things around the room to avoid focusing on the attack and spiralling into a bigger panic. 

I definitely 110% recommend discussing this in depth with a pulmonologist or your regular physician, knowing what to do in a ""worst case scenario"" type deal will help keep you calm if this ever does happen again. I also definitely suggest that if you ever feel warning signs of an attack, no matter how mild, have someone near you to just keep an eye out for you. It helps me stay calm knowing that if the situation escalates there's someone who can get help.(#8)I've been a severe asthmatic for about 5 years now.  For about 3 of those years I was in the ER for attacks 2-5 times a month.  Here's what I tend to do.  First thing when I notice any shortness of breath or asthma symptoms I start taking my inhaler or nebulizer whichever I have.  I continue to take doses every 15-20 mins until I feel better or I reach 3 rounds of meds (my doc and I came to and agreement on this).  I focus entirely on the moment.  Breathing is the only thing you have some control over in the moment.  I have a vested interest in keeping my breathing as controlled as possible, the rest of the world is of very little concern during an attack.  By making my focus so narrow, I usually don't have any panic at all. 
After 3 rounds of meds, I go to my local ER.  I know most of the respiratory staff there, and they know me and my asthma."
Has your asthma improved or worsened over time?,5,1.0,12,"(#1)so when i was young i had bad asthma it got better at 21 then at 23 till now it got worse again(#2)I am 54F and was diagnosed with moderate asthma at 23.  I take a daily maintenance inhaler and a rescue inhaler as needed.  This week I was diagnosed with an asthma flare up and bronchitis (thankfully Covid test was negative).  I didn‚Äôt have asthma symptoms as a kid that I can remember but I was diagnosed with allergies around age 12.

My doctor hasn‚Äôt said anything about my outgrowing asthma.  I don‚Äôt know anyone who outgrew it after getting diagnosed as a kid.  I was diagnosed after a bout with walking pneumonia.

Hope your kid gets better.(#3)The heaviest that I get the worst!(#4)Diagnosed at 6, definitely improved. Now in my 30s.

Doctors never told me it would go away with age. I carried my inhaler everywhere I go (still do) and had one stashed with the nurse as well.

My Mom taught me how to detect chest tightness and cup my hands over my mouth to listen for wheezing. She also taught me how to properly take my inhaler. 

I was also taught to identify my triggers like cigarette smoke or dust.

I played sports throughout HS and always used my inhaler before hand. I‚Äôve had times where I needed singular to help me through allergy season. I had maybe 2-3 times where I needed a breathing treatment while growing up.

Symbicort was a real game changer for me. When I‚Äôm on it consistently I don‚Äôt even really use my rescue inhaler.(#5)Found with asthma as a kid. Maybe 5? Needed 2 maintenance inhalers throughout childhood. Got better after having allergy shots.(#6)was born with it, was like hell the first 11 ish years of my life, (4-5 attacks per year) then it went in the backseat for about 5-6 ish years not affecting me nearly as much. (0-1 attacks per year). then out of the blue i started noticing that little things would trigger my asthma and that i had to stop eating certain foods and drinks. stress and anxiety was a major factor than ever before, and i was getting sick a lot more than usual which my asthma would make things even worse. (2-3 attacks per year)

so my asthma has been worsening over time, just in a different way :/(#7)I was a life-threatening asthmatic from 6 months onward. My usual pattern was being admitted to the hospital for 2-3 weeks every 3-4 months. It was really rough. Things started to change in my teen years and my hospitalizations became less and less frequent.

I haven't been hospitalized since I was 16-17 (38 now). Just recently I stopped taking daily medication, but I still keep an emergency inhaler (I used to go through them in a matter of weeks, my last one lasted me 8 months).

It can get better. Best of luck!(#8)I've had asthma since I was 5, which was over 30 years ago. My asthma didn't get better, bit the drugs and treatments to control it certainly did. As a result, I get up, use my maintenance preventive inhaler, and don't have think about it for the rest of the day. Treatments are REALLY GOOD now. So what you have to do is teach your child to listen to herself and tell you how she's feeling (because none of the""measurements"" for asthma are as sensitive as her). Your job is to find a good doctor who can come up with treatment for her that allow her to live her life without being limited by asthma, and who can come up with a concrete plan for exacerbations (if A doesn't work, we do B, if that doesn't work you take C, if that doesn't work you do D). Then you need to teach her what each drug does, how to take it properly (inhale deeply in time with a puff from inhaler, hold your breath, repeat, rinse mouth and gargle afterwards), how much she can use it, and recognize when it's not working. Most kids can be trusted to carry and use rescue inhaler on their own at 5-7 yo.

There‚Äôs medications you can get that you take every day to help prevent asthma flare ups :) don‚Äôt get rid of your dog, that‚Äôs fucked up.(#4)Allergy medicine. Don‚Äôt listen to people who think you should live in a bubble and not enjoy anything. Your asthma is likely being triggered by an allergy. Mild Allergic reactions typically lessen over time. Get some Claritin, enjoy your pup.(#5)Aye mate. Similar situation happened to me.

I'm 19 and my sister got a golden doodle a few months ago. When we first got it the first few weeks were the worst thing ever. Thankfully I have 2 jobs so I was usually out of the house but every day sucked so much. I now take a Zyrtec every day and have no allergy problems unless I pet her and don't wash my hands. It should get better over two months as long as you try to eat healthy and avoid sugar as it is inflammatory.(#6)Get rid of the dog."

"I have a URI, at the ER, and I'm afraid to go home. Someone please help me",17,1.0,11,"(#1)Tell them you have no one at home and aren't comfortable with being discharged in your current state. They'll work with you.(#2)See if you can start nebulizing at home - potentially insurance is able to cover a base model compression nebulizer for home use. 

Stay on top of taking those oral steroids your doctor prescribed, as much as side effects are not ideal - those medicines do help reduce inflammation in our airways. 

My heart is with you - I know the pain and the fear especially when you wake up basically suffocating and nothing helps. 

Hoping things improve for you soon(#3)It sounds like your oxygen is doing alright now, they wouldn't send you home if they felt you were in immediate danger. I know that probably doesn't just make it go away but you do need to try to calm down it sounds like. Anxiety will only make it worse. If you don't deal with GERD you can drink some coffee or other strong caffeine which will help your asthma. I would get in touch with your doctor asap about upping the steroid dose potentially as well to get through the sickness. You'll be alright though do you live alone?(#4)Maybe the doctors need to adjust your prednisone.(#5)Contact your doc asap to go over your medication and adjust as necessary (maybe even just temporarily to get through this stretch). Also, if you haven't already, you should get tested for covid.

I'm sorry I don't have any better advice :( Really hope this is just a cold and you'll get over it soon and without more trips to the ER."
Long-Term Uncontrolled Asthma Post-Pregnancy?,5,0.86,9,"(#1)Yes, it's been 16 months dealing with it. I'm going to start biologic soon. It's been a nightmare.(#2)Reason 645731 of why pregnancy scares the shit out of me(#3)Interesting. I wonder how (female) hormones affect asthma. I‚Äôve heard it can go both ways. I am of the severe, allergic, late onset kind. My asthma slowly developed in the end of my 20‚Äôs. Had a baby at 30 and had several exacerbations at 33. I am on the highest amount of inhalers (2 kinds and 1 rescue if needed) and a biological (Xolair). Developed GERD. Fairly stable now thankgod.(#4)I had the reverse - I went from severe to moderate and well controlled and I made it two years without so much as an ER visit, and then I‚Äôve had four admissions and many ER visits in the last two years. It‚Äôs almost enough to make me want to deal with pregnancy again.(#5)I am sorry to hear! I never had asthma until I was in my second trimester of my pregnancy at age 29. I had no idea what was happening and went to urgent care. I found out 1) I was having a panic attack because 2) my body didn‚Äôt know that the alien feeling of not being able to get a satisfying breath and wheezing was due to asthma. They told me to visit my doctor to get a formal diagnosis but I was sent home with a nebulizer. I was shocked to say the least. I am 38 now with controlled asthma except when I‚Äôm sick or workout extra hard.(#6)I never *really* had asthma before I was pregnant. I mean, I did. I had one instance where I wheezed in my entire life, and they gave me an inhaler for that, and I didn‚Äôt use it again. I guess I‚Äôm hindsight when I exercised in the cold, I probably had mild asthma but I didn‚Äôt wheeze or anything. 

Anyway when I was pregnant I was diagnosed with a condition that required me to take a beta blocker. And then I got asthma. It has not been fun. It‚Äôs been a year post-partum  and I am still trying to manage it. I attributed it to the beta blocker but it did occur during pregnancy like yours did. I also got really bad food allergies, if that helps at all?"

Wearing a mask helps tbh.(#4)Yeah it happens for me but wearing a mask can help because it warms the air up for you(#5)i find i get a lot of sinus pressure and irritation then for me it makes my asthma worse long term . but if i walk in the cold i get chest pain and irritated lungs(#6)Jogging in cold weather has been a huge problem for me. Going to see if the symptoms decrease this year with asthma meds.(#7)Yes, but the masks help with that, for me anyway.(#8)I always was the opposite , my asthma got worse in summer , so I used to look forward to snow and the cold but now it‚Äôs bad in the winter too(#9)Actually, the cold brings me relief. The first freeze kills off many of the plants that I'm allergic to. August / September are my worst months by a long shot.(#10)Yes. I think maybe because it promotes mucus?(#11)I've been having issues even though I have ""mild"" asthma.(#12)Yes. I have cough variant asthma and my only known trigger is cold air. Unfortunately, it took 30+ years to diagnose. Decided to go to an allergist one year after thinking I had no reason to prior. To keep my cough in check, I start taking an inhaler steroid at the end of the summer and I always cover my face with a balaclava/mask when I go outside. I had a pretty bad flare-up recently and Dulera really helped me get it under control in a matter of days.(#13)Yep.(#14)Mine gets worse aswell(#15)Yup, cold and humidity / rain. 

Many times I realized rain as a trigger. 

And apparently my real and only allergy is dust / dustmites.

It contains Aluminum Hydroxide. I feel like a fucking guinea pig. So fucking pissed(#2)Yep, this is possible. I did allergy shots for just over a year (in fits and starts) and it ended up giving me a terrible asthma exacerbation that took Damn near a year to get over. Plus, my allergies are worse, and I now have chronic urticaria."

Mum disregards asthma,15,1.0,26,"(#1)Tell your doctor and have the doctor talk to your Mom.

Make sure to detail everything you said in this thread. Don't hold back when it comes to your health and well being.(#2)I was medically neglected as a child and my parents, despite knowing I had asthma, did nothing when I was having an attack or exacerbation. I didn't even get my first inhaler until I was 17, after a 4-month-long exacerbation that they ignored. I ended up making my own appointments to get treated. 

I feel your pain. I'm sorry.(#3)As someone raised by a narcissist, your mom sounds like she has narcissistic personality disorder. I'm only getting part of the picture and could be totally off base (I really hope I'm wrong), but her seemingly callous disregard for your well-being indicates she cares only about herself and her regular gaslighting of your experience are classic npd traits. I suggest seeking outside help, maybe from a trusted family friend, doctor or teacher - your mom is endangering your mental and physical well-being. I hope things get better soon.(#4)Incense are the absolute worst!!!(#5)omg. my honest advice is to stay away from her. Period. if you can find somewhere else to stay it would be a good idea. that‚Äôs so toxic.(#6)Some non asthmatics have a very seriously hard time understanding what it is like to have your chest tighten up to the point where you are short of breathe. It is something so foreign to them that they can't appreciate how much it sucks. Comparing it to being out of breathe after rigorous exercise is a somewhat good description - but people associate that with quick recovery in some way or another, whereas for us it just gets even worse.(#7)Your school counselor is trained to handle situations like this.

Thrush/candida(?) from Advair use?,6,1.0,6,(#1)Hi there! This is really common with the diskus. The powder can also cause hoarseness as well. I would recommend talking to your doctor about getting the inhaler version - thrush can still occur if you're not rinsing out your mouth after use but I've found its easier to manage!(#2)I got really bad thrush from the Advair inhaler and had to go through a round of nystatin and diflucan. 100% recommend a spacer because it worked tremendously and the thrush didn't come back.
Humidifier,2,1.0,3,(#1)You can denature bleach by using alcohol wipes. That should get rid of any lingering fumes.
Why does my asthma start at night,7,1.0,18,"(#1)It has to do with your cortisol levels as they cycle throughout the day.(#2)What u/giraffee2035 said. When it gets cold & dry out, asthma can get worse for some people. At night it might be because you‚Äôve been active during the day so your body needs the rest, if you have any kind of allergies or this happens during particular seasons of the year it could be allergy related. So in a certain season you can get generally worse symptoms, but being exposed to an allergen all day can also make asthma worse by bedtime. 

Try getting on a medication if your doctor recommends, in the meantime you can try a hot, steamy shower or run a humidifier before bed (if your weather is like mine this time of year being cold & dry). If you‚Äôre suspicious of allergies - take a shower before bed, keep windows/doors closed, keep things clean (so wash sheets more often and no outside clothes in bed), you can start taking an antihistamine to see if it helps, just be warned that they take a week or two to be really effective.(#3)Generally because the air gets cooler, it might be that medication is also starting to wear off‚Ä¶ as for pollen and stuff I‚Äôm not too sure‚Ä¶ it could be your environment, ie. Laying in bed with dust or something?(#4)Apparently sleep apnea and asthma can be linked in some kinda way(#5)It could also be GERD, particularly if your asthma is worse after eating.(#6)Try the mattress/pillowcase covers to prevent dust mites. Big trigger for me.(#7)Hi. So I‚Äôm not diagnosed yet but I‚Äôve been having asthma symptoms for two months. my cough/wheezing does get worse at night.

Albuterol sickness/overdose?,6,1.0,5,"(#1)It's not the albuterol, it's the after effects of having an asthma exacerbation.(#2)It‚Äôs hard sometimes because an attack means tonnes of rescue inhaler doses most of the time. I just had an attack today and the hospital had me hit that thing about 20 times in a day. I feel pretty wrecked. 

But an asthma attack is rough on your body, it‚Äôs quite a shock. A nurse warned me when I was new to asthma that I may feel Ill for a few days after and to rest. 

Treat yourself like your sick, the recovery treatment is basically the same: rest, fluids, take your medicines as  instructed, and take it easy.(#3)I use my inhaler like 3x a day and im fine"

New to asthma and I have some questions for y'all.,5,1.0,5,"(#1)O2 range of 95 is fine.  You should try a different preventative inhaler. You probably still cant exercise but should be able to walk.

Also if the season changes you might feel better. For me I am allergic to mold and pollen so it never gets better.

Are you on montelukast currently?(#2)Hey. I'm so sorry you're going through this. I can absolutely relate. I started having asthma exacerbations - pretty much like a never ending exacerbation - since March 2020. Tried different inhalers, steroids non stop, nebulizing constantly... It's very depressing to not be able to walk around as much as you want or exercise as much as you used to. I get it! My oxygen on a good day is 96%, on a very good day 98% and regular days 94-95%. What really is a good tool to measure your asthma situation is a peak flow meter. You should get together with your doctor and try to find a range that is tolerable for you and when you need to get emergency treatment. I started tracking the results of the peak flow on a good day and on a bad day, and that gives me an idea of when to call the doctor or go to the hospital (of course I've been to the hospital several times because the breathlessness was unbearable).
I did find relief in getting imaging done. Like xray or CT scan. It made me feel better knowing that there wasn't anything else that could be causing this, but maybe there are contributing factors exacerbating an already asthma diagnosis, such as allergies, viral infections, acid reflux...
What breathing exercises are you doing?
I would definitely get something on board for acid reflux. I'm pretty sure my asthma gets exacerbated after over eating or eating things that are too acidic. Maybe start a journal of what you eat and how it makes you feel during the day and after a couple of days?
Do you have phlegm? Dairy can increment your mucus production.
Make sure you are hydrated. We definitely don't need to make matters worse, right? üòí

Counteracting mold allergies?,3,1.0,1,"(#1)Its probably coming from the central AC system.

I am in the US so it may be different but the pharmacist was happy to give me it once he heard I have been on prednisone over 5 times this year. If pharmacies are the ones handling the vaccines I would go and discuss with them what you would need and if you are eligible.(#3)Hey man, I'm in the same boat albeit a good few years older. I also can't get my booster yet and have been told that I now don't need to be bumped up the list to get it early, unlike my previous two jabs.

Drug interactions,0,0.5,19,"(#1)Drugs.com check interactions.(#2)In the future, use an online interaction checker and call your pharmacist for advice on medication combinations. 

What I found says taking these two together might increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects like inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, etc, but nothing else was listed. I typically limit ibuprofen usage anyway due to those side effects, just keep a close eye on how you‚Äôre feeling or take another pain reliever like Tylenol that doesn‚Äôt have those same side effects if you can. But, please call your doctor and/or pharmacist for more details or an alternative and actual medical advice(#3)Ibuprofen is generally not good for asthma(or anyone really) so i would try to use something else if possible."

Montelukast stopped working,1,1.0,1,"(#1)It's not that montelukast has stopped working, it's that your asthma is suddenly worse because it's being triggered by something."
Lung obstruction,3,0.8,14,"(#1)[deleted](#2)COPD is an acronym that stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

The obstruction comes when the airways collapse before you're able to fully exhale. There are only 5 obstructive pulmonary disease processes. They are Cystic Fibrosis, Bronchitis, Asthma, Bronchiectasis and emphysema. a mild one of these is treatable but would require additional support with another illness onboard such as flu.

My recommendation is to do pursed lipped breathing when you are having difficulty (knowing you're under medical care already). This helps keep the furthest airways open longer for exhalation. Also you don't mention anything about a bronchodilator such as albuterol or a long term acting one such as salmeterol but you may benefit from asking your doctor about that too. The combination of bronchodilator with corticosteroid should help. Make sure you stay properly hydrated and go for as many 20 minute walks as you can handle. I hope you feel better fast.

edit: for clarification many use ""copd"" and ""emphysema"" interchangeably when talking about emphysema, it's not accurate but just so you know, in case someone says you have copd I wouldn't want you to think you have all 5 of those diseases. but when they say you have copd they mean emphysema and yes medical professionals and doctors here in massachusetts even do it. It's good to ask for clarification because a bad case of bronchitis can look like emphysema too, it's just a little higher in the airway. So make sure they educate you and ask all the questions you need to.(#3)It may be long-covid. Covid can leave hard to detect lung damage. It‚Äôs unknown how frequently it occurs.

Are we in a greater risk for COVID-19 and most likely to die if we get infected?,4,0.67,14,"(#1)Asthma is *not* generally considered a risk factor for  COVID-19. 

If your asthma is controlled then you're not at higher risk of getting it or of getting it badly. I got COVID last Christmas and barely noticed. That said, like anyone you still have a chance of getting it badly and should still take standard precautions. If your asthma is severe or uncontrolled, then you are at somewhat greater risk.

To illustrate, only asthmatics who'd had multiple prescriptions for steroid tablets/spent overnight in hospital in the past few years or were already officially shielding were allowed to get vaccinated as a priority group in the UK. The rest of us had to wait and get them with the general population, because we were not in more danger than them.

Edit: Either way, it doesn't kill you in two days. The median time to death is more like 18 days. I know that's pedantic and beside the point, but personally I find that kind of pedantic fact checking useful when I need to tell the difference between an actual risk and my anxiety catastrophising.(#2)If you were going to die, you would have died last year when scientists were still trying to figure everything out.

If you have not, the smartest thing you can do is get vaxed.(#3)My pulmonologist said he never had an asthma patient with severe covid-19. I don‚Äôt think you have to be afraid, just be catious (wash your hands, wear your mask, etc.) And my doctor gave me vitamin C, D and zink to strengthen my immune system(#4)Are you taking inhaled corticosteroids for asthma maintenance? If so, then preliminary studies suggest that your are actually less likely to get seriously sick from Covid-19.

Otherwise do what you can to reduce your chances of getting seriously sick. Get vaccinated against Covid-19. If you were vaccinated now than 6m ago, get a booster. Try to get enough sleep, exercise, and vitamin D.(#5)But the issue is , if the asthma is already between mild- moderate and if we get covid its gonna be like waaay worse after . this year i already had a lot of problems lol(#6)I got covid and actually was breathing better than normal lol.  Not saying everyone would have the same experience but I'm not sure it's a major factor as much as say obesity and comorbidities of that nature.(#7)My daughter has asthma and got Covid.

I grew up down south, so when I moved up north it was quite a surprise how brutal the weather was. Once I realize cold air was a trigger, masks became essential.(#4)It does the same thing to me, and others as well. Totally hate it; I think it's the part where going from cold to warm that's the worst, or warm to cold that makes it really hard. Shifting from one to the other is just hard. Your body makes SOME kind of adjustment when you're in the cold/warm, but it's still really rough to deal with.

I find just breathing into a scarf usually helps.(#5)[deleted](#6)Instead of overdressing, try wearing a buff over your face to prewarm the air.(#7)Winter was hard for me too and I found myself getting very short of breath. Slightly different to what you are describing, I think. But, I spoke to my doctor/asthma nurse and they were able to change my inhaler which gave some relief during the winter months.

Teeth and asthma meds,4,0.83,15,"(#1)I'm pretty sure they recommend brushing teeth and rinsing your mouth after you take asthma medication now.

No amount of rinsing will save you if you have taken oral steroids on and off throughout life.

I think I need to stop escaping.(#4)I take muxinex before bed to help with phlegm(#5)Yes mine has been like this since august 25 when i got my wisdom tooth out now i have had symptoms of asthma since‚Ä¶ every night i wake up with chest/throat tightness. I‚Äôm constantly coughing/wheezing too! And it‚Äôs not a sick cough. It‚Äôs so weird. I go in on Tuesday to see if i have asthma."
Should I stop?,0,0.5,4,(#1)WTF kind of question is this? EVERYONE should stop smoking.(#2)Yes(#3)Why the fuck wouldn‚Äôt you?(#4)Yes. It's not worth it.
"using levalbuterol for a while now, are shaking side effects normal?",12,0.88,14,"(#1)yeah it‚Äôs a super common side effect(#2)Alas, to dilate the airway you‚Äôll be jazzing up the nervous system. And if you want real asthma superpowers‚Ä¶ Prednisone !!!!! Absolute Power !!!! And hungry‚Ä¶ so hungry‚Ä¶ 

Oddly best solution Is exercise / activity‚Ä¶ take a hit, rinse and spit to keep your stomach from being annoyed, then go for a walk..(#3)Yes, definitely. For like ten minutes, I feel shaky inside and out (weird way to put it), feel shaky and sometimes even anxious.(#4)Yes. After using the inhaler, rinse your mouth and gargle several times right away. This will reduce shaking side effect.(#5)If you are using your rescue more than 2-3 times a week, your asthma is not in control and you need to see your doctor about adjusting your controller med.(#6)Happens to me a lot(#7)I am not entirely sure if this is the case but you might adapt to it. Maybe other lifelongers could chine in. I have been using a rescue inhaler once a week or so since I was 5 and I dont get shaky unless its a proper asthma attack and I have to use more than 4 puffs. Usually when that happens I am also on prednisone as well."
Canker sores from inhaler?,2,0.75,0,
Im in pain,4,0.83,7,"(#1)Have you tried the app GoodRX? I used to use it when I didn‚Äôt have medical insurance.(#2)https://www.primatene.com/where-to-buy.aspx(#3)If you‚Äôre having an asthma attack you should go to a clinic or hospital where they can get you meds right away. You can always pay the bill later after Christmas.(#4)Ask your friends and family to see if they have a diste inhaler. My pharmacy sends me one every couple of weeks, so I end up with quite a few.(#5)Caffeine dude, lots of it, it's a brocodilator"
Advice Please,8,1.0,10,"(#1)Wear your mask at home until they are done or remove yourself from the situation.(#2)[deleted](#3)Get an air purifier(#4)Seconding the air purifier, we have filters in the heating system already but the portable air purifier had a solid coat of debris right away during our construction. Absolutely better for sleep too.(#5)Just FYI, unless they are using special low VOC paint those fumes will be around for a while. Do you have a friend or a relative you can stay with for a week?(#6)The most important thing you do is to avoid your triggers as much as possible. If you master this alone this can prevent you from having frequent flare ups.

Use use your nebulizer as frequently as possible. Nebulize with salbutamol nebule 1 nebule every 4 or 6 hours until symptoms subside. 

Since you're already a chronic asthmatic, steroid inhaler is not new to you. I suggest ask your doctor to provide you with an inhaler with steroid and a long acting bronchodilator. Ask your doctor for instructions.

Actually your steroid inhaler can be used as a maintenance even if you don't feel sick. When you do this it prevents flares when exposed to your triggers.(#7)What does your action plan say? Assuming you have one.(#8)had this experience this summer . nagging symptoms as well . me i had to go to an emergency clinic to stop my symptoms , if symptoms get worse id go to an emergency clinic , lol theyll take good care of you i promise"
My project: app helping children with Asthma,15,0.86,13,"(#1)Sorry if I've not understood correctly, but to use this for a child I would put my phone in their bed, and when the child coughs / wheezes an alarm will sound waking the child and myself up?(#2)This is great . Like a baby monitor? totally would do this for my child"
Symbicort,9,1.0,16,"(#1)I'm T1D. No noticeable blood sugar effects for me.(#2)I use Advair Diskus which is also dry powder.  I have prediabetes but it hasn‚Äôt affected my blood sugar at all.

I suggest asking your doctor.(#3)This is really something you need to discuss with your doctor.

Not a diabetic but type 2 diabetes does run in my family and my A1C always comes back normal.(#4)Im on the Symbicort HFA. with an added spacer.

I really like the inhaled mist vs the powder ones. I always felt like the powder ones left more on my tongue than getting into lungs.(#5)Symbicort is great for me! I take symbicort, loratadine and fluticasone nasal spray everyday and my symptoms have been entirely in control(#6)Systemic absorption from topical steroids (creams, nasal sprays, eye drops, inhalers, etc) is so low that significant side effects are unusual and generally only seen with high doses or multiple routes of administration.

Oral steroids are much more likely to cause side effects like hyperglycemia, and I've seen many patients have raised blood sugars caused by short courses of oral steroids.

Far better to use inhaled steroids to control asthma and prevent the need for oral steroids, than avoid inhaled steroids and then have a flare up needing oral steroids(#7)I've used Symbicort since it first came out. Haven't gone back to any others. It works even after the ""doses"" have run out.(#8)No idea for the blood sugar, but I was on Symbicort for about 10 years. I've been switched off it to go on Sirdupla (because it quit working quite so well)(#9)I use generic advair. Just rinse your mouth out and spit after you use it.(#10)[deleted]"
Concerns over wool carpets: Are they asthmatics friendly? ..,6,0.8,16,"(#1)I don't think it matters whether the carpet is wool vs synthetic per se. It is that both materials trap dust and generate dust themselves as textiles.(#2)I have wool sweaters that don't bother me.

That's extremely unusual that an apartment would go for more expensive wool carpets over synthetics.(#3)The drs recommendation I got for my dust mite allergy: reduce carpets and curtains as much as possible, keep bedroom especially clean. I would try it out if you're really fond/it's a financial concern, and if not start changing things, starting with the bedroom.(#4)No carpet is allergy-friendly.(#5)I have wool area rugs. I‚Äôve not noticed a problem with them. I‚Äôm not allergic to dust though. I do vacuum all my floors daily though. I just like having clean floors.(#6)On top of the usual dust trap capabilities, it will depend on whether you're also allergic to wool.(#7)We‚Äôve changed our carpets to laminate and wood much easier to clean as well(#8)[deleted](#9)[deleted]"
What are some food triggers for you guys?,1,0.57,19,"(#1)Dairy(#2)All food I‚Äôll just die üòî(#3)Dairy and SOMETIMES anything super cold but it depends how im feeling that day tho(#4)Pizza. Too much milk. Any sort of over eating(#5)I don‚Äôt have any problems with what I personally eat but I sometimes feel sick when people at work cook smelly foods in the microwave.  Fortunately I only have to work in the office 1 week a month.  A friend and I found a place to eat that isn‚Äôt the office break room.(#6)My parents told me I couldn't have ice-cream (they made it up). I tried Ice-cream for the first time when I was 13(#7)ranch, mustard, ketchup, milk, some meat and lemon/lime(#8)Anything with vinegar.  Especially if it‚Äôs warm.(#9)Anything really cold.
But if we're talking about foods that I'm allergic to that cause wheezing and coughing as part of the symptoms (I carry an epi pen), crustacea, any part of the elder plant, nettles in any form, overripe bananas and pear extract.(#10)Wheat, barley, oats, rye, nuts and peanut. I have issues where if I'm near a food place, Etc smelling the things that are made with those foods I end up having breathing issues."
Smart one peak flow,5,1.0,13,"(#1)I have an old digital one and it always shows a lower number than my mechanical one.(#2)I have the omron basic peak flow meter and it was 15.00 on Amazon I had a lung test Monday and it was dead on. My electronic one that was 60.00 was higher by line 40 points....(#3)How about you do two readings on each of the machines? It takes a whole while, but try to at least alternate(#4)i get similar readings on both smartpeak, and an old school style peak flow. 

It is a bit annoying the smart one has to be used in daylight. it errors out otherwise. Kind of a problem in night and short winter days.(#5)I get about 40 points higher on the SmartOne but the trends are same as a non digital meter."
Asthma without wheezing?,4,0.84,7,"(#1)You may have VCD - vocal chord dysfunction coupled with anxiety.(#2)If it started shortly after your 2nd vax, you should report it to VAERS (if in the US), you can do this yourself, you do NOT need a medical professional to fill it out for you.(#3)Possible. It is known that a virus can piss off your lungs and start an asthma flare.(#4)I don‚Äôt always have audible wheezing when I‚Äôm having an attack, I usually get slapped after ascultation with ‚Äúdecreased airflow to the X part of Y lung.‚Äù When I do wheeze, it‚Äôs really mild. 

But ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not asthma if it‚Äôs constant. Asthma is very much intermittent, and you would have empirical signs like lowered SPO2% during acute attacks, and crappy flow meter readings. Those lung tests will probably be spirom√®try tests which are the gold standard for asthma. You can ask them to test for it, it‚Äôs not like the test is fancy. 

But loads of things could be causing this. I hope it‚Äôs not asthma, and that it is something temporary an benign. I wish you luck."
Wheezing when exhaling,1,0.67,4,"(#1)Have you ever tried taking allergy meds?

It's really stupid to smoke unless you are really desperate to actually become asthmatic or worse. Lungs are designed for one thing - to breathe air.(#2)Go see an allergist that specializes in asthma.

A lot of asthma is Allergy induced. [https://www.healthline.com/health/allergies/allergy-induced-asthma#symptoms](https://www.healthline.com/health/allergies/allergy-induced-asthma#symptoms)(#3)Wheezing from the throat could be Vocal Cord Dysfunction.(#4)Have you thought about edibles instead of smoking? Real advise is to give up smoking. I also have wheezing when exhaling and sometimes coughing fixes it, but I also experience shortness of breath, so in my case, asthma is a more sensible diagnosis. If I was in your situation I would get evaluated for allergies and acid reflux. Talk to a different doctor if you don't feel like you're being listened to. Good luck to you üçÄ"
Anyone had issues with Brown phlegm?,4,0.83,5,"(#1)You a smoker or anything? Coughing up tar can look brown. I would probably say talk to a doctor just incase it‚Äôs something serious.(#2)If you've been coughing a lot, it's not unusual for there to be a little blood in the airways. If it clots or has been there a while, brown phlegm fits that pretty well.

I've had it before and it was nothing to be concerned about, but if you're worried then grab a phone consultation with your asthma nurse or doctor if you can. Until you get the appointment, drink plenty of water, and if you're not averse to steam (I know some people find it triggers coughing), it might help loosen any gunk.(#3)Most likely bronchitis. I used to get bronchitis like clockwork right when fall came around and would fought up the nastiest, stickiest brown phlegm in the shower every morning.(#4)Thanks everyone, I took your advice and talked to my doctor. I'm none the wiser on what it is but I have steriods and antibiotics, and if no better by Monday, a chest xray."
Exact immunoplasty and info on those of you with non food allergies,7,0.82,3,"(#1)Thank you! I've heard about testing of this treatment a few years ago from my allergist, but didn't know it was successful. It sounds like it's only offered in Austin TX right now. It will probably take time for the company to roll this treatment out to other areas. I'm happy on allergy shots, so I'll continue with those. But I was considering sending my husband to get allergy shots for his hay fever, and I think I'll wait for this treatment to come to town."
My wife is asthmatic üò´,5,1.0,7,"(#1)She may have vocal chord dysfunction or possibly GERD. Both disorders can have symptoms that mimic asthma.(#2)Could be VCD, GERD, post-nasal drip, etc. Many people with asthma also experience one of those conditions, and some are misdiagnosed with asthma altogether. 

What kind of doctor is she seeing regularly for her asthma? It definitely sounds like she should be seeing a specialist if she isn't right now.(#3)All my triggers as well !"
