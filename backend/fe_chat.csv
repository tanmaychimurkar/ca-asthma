What could I do to improve my asthma?,"Taking your preventive medication as directed is the most important element to control your asthma. In addition, pay attention to the factors that influence your asthma (like pollen) regularly and take steps to minimize the impact if that factor is high.

Should I see a doctor?,"If you are having specific symptoms that indicate a severe attack, like severe breathlessness or wheezing, especially at night or in the early morning, the inability to speak more than short phrases due to shortness of breath, or having to strain your chest muscles to breathe you should seek medical attention right away. But if that's not happening, I use the Asthma Control Test to regularly assess your condition.  You can check your last answers if you click in the dashboard on ""asthma"" and scroll down a bit. If your score is less than 20, your asthma is considered not well controlled, and if it's less than 15, it's considered poorly controlled. If your asthma is not well controlled, you should make an appointment and share the results of the Asthma Control Test with him or her."
What can I do to sleep better?,"If your sleep problems are asthma-induced you will want to minimize allergens and pollutants in your bedroom: Take a shower and wash your hair before you go to bed and change your beddings frequently, do not sleep with an open window, and consider a quality air filter in your bedroom. Taking your preventive medication will also help. "
