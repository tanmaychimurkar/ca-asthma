Your privacy and the security of your data are extremely important to us. To be transparent, we want you to understand how we use, collect and share your personal and health data, and how we design all our products to protect them because your data belongs to you. You can find more detailed information in our full Privacy Policy."
20,x,Do you recommend a device to use with juli?,"juli uses the data collected by your iPhone. The more data is available, from any iPhone compatible device (Fitbit, Apple Watch, smart scale, etc), the more likely juli is to help identify patterns and associations."
31,x,What is Heart Rate Variability?,"Heart Rate Variability is how much the time between your heartbeat changes. A high HRV indicates your body is relaxed and resilient, while a low HRV indicates you are under stress."
36,x,Why doesn't juli give me any recommendations how to improve?,"Health is complicated, and so we need enough data on you to be able to make recommendations specific to you. We are working on our machine learning system to work with less data to customize recommendations, stay tuned. "
37,x,What could I do to improve my asthma?,"Taking your preventive medication as directed is the most important element to control your asthma. In addition, pay attention to the factors that influence your asthma (like pollen) regularly and take steps to minimize the impact if that factor is high. For example, if your asthma is pollen-induced, check the pollen prediction and act accordingly: i.e. wash your clothing and your hair frequently. Check juli to find more correlations."
44,x,Is there anything I need to worry about today?,Most people with asthma should focus on pollen and air pollution. Check the juli dashboard to see today's levels. 
45,x,Should I see a doctor?,"If you are having specific symptoms that indicate a severe attack, like severe breathlessness or wheezing, especially at night or in the early morning, the inability to speak more than short phrases due to shortness of breath, or having to strain your chest muscles to breathe you should seek medical attention right away. But if that's not happening, I use the Asthma Control Test to regularly assess your condition.  You can check your last answers if you click in the dashboard on ""asthma"" and scroll down a bit. If your score is less than 20, your asthma is considered not well controlled, and if it's less than 15, it's considered poorly controlled. If your asthma is not well controlled, you should make an appointment and share the results of the Asthma Control Test with him or her. "
52,x,What can I do to sleep better?,"If your sleep problems are asthma-induced you will want to minimize allergens and pollutants in your bedroom: Take a shower and wash your hair before you go to bed and change your beddings frequently, do not sleep with an open window, and consider a quality air filter in your bedroom. Taking your preventive medication will also help. "
