The most common asthma treatments are inhalers. These are considered the best asthma treatments for most people. This is because inhalers help get the medicine to the airways where it’s needed. Almost everyone with asthma has a preventer inhaler and a reliever inhaler.
"Almost everyone with asthma has a preventer inhaler and a reliever inhaler. Everyone with asthma can benefit from a preventer inhaler.
Preventer inhalers prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways. This means you’re less likely to get symptoms if you come across your asthma triggers. 
Regular preventer medicine helps prevent asthma attacks. Reliever inhalers relieve asthma symptoms like coughing, wheezing, breathlessness, and a tight chest. You use your reliever inhaler just when you have symptoms or an asthma attack.
If your asthma is well controlled, you shouldn’t need to use your reliever inhaler often - or at all. But remember to always carry it with you in case symptoms do flare up. A small number of people who have mild symptoms very infrequently may only need a reliever inhaler to use when they get symptoms. However, some studies suggest that everyone should have a preventer inhaler too, to lower their risk of asthma attacks."
"If you're using your reliever inhaler three or more times a week, see your GP or asthma nurse as soon as possible to review your treatment plan. If you've only been prescribed a reliever inhaler, see your GP or asthma nurse urgently to ask for a preventer inhaler too."
You need a preventer inhaler if you've noticed symptoms three or more times a week or you wake up at night with symptoms or you've had an asthma attack in the last two years.
"As a kind of add-on treatment, a long-acting bronchodilator opens up your airways. It contains reliever medicines that last 12 hours. It can lower your risk of asthma attacks. You must continue to take your preventer inhaler as prescribed because long-acting bronchodilators cannot deal with the inflammation in your airways. Your GP may prescribe a long-acting bronchodilator in a combination inhaler. This is one inhaler containing both the long-acting bronchodilator and your preventer medicine. You'll need your usual blue reliever inhaler too, in case you get symptoms. A certain type of long-acting bronchodilator medicine, found in MART inhalers (Maintenance and reliever therapy), can give quick relief for asthma symptoms too. This means you can use your MART inhaler as an emergency reliever as well. But not all combination inhalers can be used as a reliever so check with your GP. Make sure your GP or asthma nurse explains what your long-acting bronchodilator can and cannot do."
"As a kind of add-on treatment, montelukast is a preventer tablet. It is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA). This kind of medicine helps with the inflammation in your airways. Unlike your preventer inhaler, montelukast does not contain steroids. You need to take it alongside your regular steroid preventer inhaler."
"As a kind of add-on treatment, Your GP may prescribe you oral steroids (usually prednisolone) in addition to your usual asthma medicines. Steroids help you get symptoms under control in the short term, or if you’ve had an asthma attack, by reducing the inflammation in your airways. If you frequently need oral steroids, or you need to take them long-term, you should be referred to an asthma specialist to look at other ways to manage your asthma."
"Call 144 for an ambulance if you're having an asthma attack and your symptoms do not improve after ten puffs, 30-60 seconds apart, of your reliever inhaler, or if you feel worse at any point."
"If you do have an asthma attack, the first line of treatment is your blue reliever inhaler. This can quickly get symptoms under control. If you need to be treated in hospital for an asthma attack, you’ll be treated with higher doses of reliever medicine. Sometimes this will be given through a nebuliser. You’ll also be given oxygen. You’ll need to take a course of steroid tablets as part of your recovery plan. See your GP for a follow up after being discharged from hospital. They can make sure you’re making a good recovery, and that you’re not at risk from another attack. Remember: taking your preventer medicine every day is the best way to prevent symptoms from building up into an asthma attack."
"If you have any concerns about the treatments you’ve been prescribed you can speak to a respiratory nurse specialist on our Helpline by calling 0300 222 5800, Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm. Or you can WhatsApp them on 07378 606728."
"You will probably take more medicine when you begin treatment to get control of your asthma. Work with your doctor to learn which medicine(s) control your asthma best and how much you need. Once your asthma is well-controlled, your doctor may be able to reduce the amount of medicine you take. The goal is to gain control of your asthma as soon as possible and then control it with as little medicine as possible. Once long-term anti-inflammatory therapy begins, your doctor should monitor you every one to six months. This is to see how your asthma medicines are working and if your asthma is well controlled."
"Many people wake up with asthma symptoms such as coughing or wheezing. You can control nighttime symptoms by taking asthma medicines as directed by your doctor. Removing triggers where you sleep may help you sleep better. Many people are allergic to dust mites and mold found in bedding materials. Using mattress or pillow encasements can help contain those allergens. Dehumidifiers can also be helpful to reduce the humidity in your home that dust mites and mold need to exist. Using air cleaners in your bedroom may also help reduce your exposure to allergens and irritants (animal dander, dust mites, air pollution, etc.)."
"Exercising, particularly in cold air, may cause airway swelling or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Quick-relief asthma medicines, taken before exercise, usually control this. If you need repeated doses of quick-relief medicine during and after exercise talk with your doctor. Your medicines may need to be adjusted. Thanks to these medicines, many Olympic and professional athletes have successful sports careers even with their asthma. It is important for everyone, including people with asthma, to be as active as possible for good health. Talk with your doctor about how you can be physically active while keeping your asthma well-controlled."
All medicines have side effects. Tell your doctor how you are responding to the treatment and if you have any side effects. Follow up often with your doctor so you can control your asthma with the least amount of medicines and with the fewest side effects.
"If using reliever and preventer inhalers does not control your asthma, you may need an inhaler that combines both. Combination inhalers are used every day to help stop symptoms occurring and provide long-lasting relief if they do occur. It's important to use it regularly, even if you do not have symptoms. Side effects of combination inhalers are similar to those of reliever and preventer inhalers."
"A procedure called bronchial thermoplasty may be offered as a treatment for severe asthma. It works well and there are no serious concerns about its safety. You will be sedated or put to sleep using a general anaesthetic during a bronchial thermoplasty. It involves passing a thin, flexible tube down your throat and into your lungs. Heat is then used on the muscles around the airways to help stop them narrowing and causing asthma symptoms."
"If you seem to have occupational asthma, where your asthma is linked to your job, you'll be referred to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis. If your employer has an occupational health service, they should also be informed, along with your health and safety officer. Your employer has a responsibility to protect you from the causes of occupational asthma."
"If you’re using rescue inhalers (or quick-relief inhalers) more than 2 days a week, see your doctor. "
"Inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective long-term control medicines. These aren’t the same as anabolic steroids that people use to grow muscle. They include beclomethasone (Qvar RediHaler), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), ciclesonide (Alvesco), fluticasone (Flovent HFA), and mometasone (Asmanex Twisthaler)."
"Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists open your airways by relaxing the smooth muscles around them. You’ll take this medication along with an inhaled corticosteroid. They include formoterol, salmeterol, and vilanterol."
"Combination inhaled medicines have an inhaled corticosteroid along with a long-acting beta-agonist. This is an easy way to take them together. They include Advair, Breo, Dulera, and Symbicort."
"Biologics target a cell or protein in your body to prevent airway inflammation. They may be shots or infusions you get every few weeks. They can be expensive, so you usually get them if other medications don’t work. Biologics include benralizumab (Fasenra), dupilumab (Dupixent), mepolizumab (Nucala), omalizumab (Xolair), and reslizumab (Cinqair)."
"Leukotriene modifiers relax the smooth muscles around your airways and ease swelling. You can take them as pills or liquids. These include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and zileuton (Zyflo)."
Cromolyn prevents your airways from swelling when they come into contact with an asthma trigger. It’s a non-steroid medicine that comes in an inhaler.
"Theophylline (Theo-24, Theo-Dur) relaxes the smooth muscles that narrow your airways. It comes as a tablet, capsule, solution, or syrup."
Tezepelumab-ekko (Tezspire) injection is a first-in-class medicine indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.
Long-acting bronchodilators. You might use tiotropium (Spiriva) along with corticosteroids if you have ongoing asthma symptoms even though you take a daily inhaled steroid. Never use long-acting bronchodilators alone as a long-term asthma treatment.
"Corticosteroids. If no other medicine can get your asthma attacks under control, your doctor might have you take these medications for a couple of weeks. They come in pills or liquids."
"If you’re having trouble using small inhalers, your doctor may recommend a nebulizer. This machine changes asthma medications from a liquid to a mist so it’s easier to get the medicine into your lungs. It also has a mouthpiece or mask that makes it a good option for infants, small children, older adults, or anyone who has trouble using inhalers with spacers. It takes a few more minutes to use than an inhaler."
"Many medications have side effects. For example, inhaled steroids can cause mild problems, such as thrush infections and a sore throat, or more serious ones including eye disorders and bone loss. Keep your doctor up to date with how well your treatment is working and whether you have side effects. They’ll work with you to keep your asthma under control with as little medicine as possible."
"Medications aren’t the only way to control asthma. Your doctor might also try a condition called bronchial thermoplasty. People with asthma often have extra smooth muscle in their airway walls. In this procedure, your doctor uses a small tube called a bronchoscope to send heat to the walls and reduce the smooth muscle. You’ll get the treatment over three visits about 2 or 3 weeks apart."
Breathing exercises. These can lower the amount of medication you need to control your symptoms.
"Caffeine. It’s a mild bronchodilator, meaning it can open your airways, but it doesn’t work as fast as medications. Avoid caffeine for several hours before any medical appointment that might include a lung function test."
"If you’ve been diagnosed with asthma but your treatment doesn’t seem to work anymore, it’s time to see your doctor again. Likewise, if you’re having to use your rescue inhaler too often, see your doctor. You may need to change your asthma treatment for better control. Though asthma is common, it’s a serious condition that needs a diagnosis and treatment. Talk to your doctor for asthma support, and find the medications that work best for you."
"Treatment focuses on a person keeping their chronic symptoms in check and avoiding triggers while receiving quick relief during severe flare-ups. Doctors call a flare-up of asthma symptoms an asthma attack, and the treatment they prescribe tries to limit further attacks and reduce the need for rapid medication.
Also, treatment aims to restore and maintain a person’s lung function, activity levels, and sleep patterns. As the disease has a variety of causes and people of all ages can have it, most individuals will have a different action plan and course of treatment. In this article, we explore the management options for asthma."
"Typically, people should attend asthma consultations every 2 to 6 weeks after first receiving a diagnosis. However, using a peak flow meter at home to monitor the progress of their treatment can help them manage the disease in between doctor’s visits. A peak flow meter is a simple, handheld tool that can help a person maintain control of their asthma by allowing them to measure the effectiveness of air movement from their lungs. The meter reveals a “peak flow” number after a person blows into the device. A doctor will indicate how often a person should use the test, how to interpret the results, and how to judge how much medication they need to take. The doctor may request that a person either records their scores every morning or uses the peak flow meter intermittently. The monitoring aims to find and maintain a “personal best”peak flow number by recording the scores for 2 to 3 weeks after diagnosis. The personal best score will dictate the dosage and delivery method of medications. By comparing future scores with the individual’s best score, a doctor can measure whether their treatment is working. Peak flow can also warn of an oncoming asthma attack before symptoms are apparent."
"A person is applying treatment effectively if the following apply:
1. coughing and breathlessness occurs on no more than 2 days per week
2. They need quick-relief medicines on fewer than 2 days per week
3. they are maintaining good lung function
4. their activity levels remaining normal
5. asthma symptoms are waking them from sleep on fewer than 1 to 2 nights per month
6. they do not need emergency medical treatment
7. they are experiencing one or fewer asthma attacks per year that require corticosteroid treatment
8. peak flow is staying higher than 80 percent of the personal best
Good control also means people need to be avoiding asthma triggers and allergens as well."
"The primary forms of quick-relief asthma medications are beta2-agonists, a class of drugs that includes:
1. metaproterenol
2. epinephrine, available in EpiPen and EpiPen Jr., Adrenalin, and Epinephrine Mist
3. albuterol, under brand names that include Ventolin HFA, Proventil, and Proair
4. levalbuterol, available as Xopenex
Most asthma medication is available in the form of a powder or mist for oral administration with an inhaler. An inhaler is a device that “mists” the medicine, promoting more efficient and direct delivery to the lungs. Asthma medicines can sometimes take the form of a pill, as well."
"A person with asthma should use these drugs daily to reduce flare-ups and ongoing symptoms. The most effective drugs for long-term asthma control are known as inhaled corticosteroids. These provide inflammation relief and reduce a person’s sensitivity to allergens and triggers. However, the medicines do have side effects, such as thrush that causes a fungal infection of the mouth. When corticosteroids reach the mouth or throat, the risk of thrush increases. Manufacturers of inhaler devices have developed spacers or holding chambers to help prevent thrush. Rinsing the mouth after inhalation can have a similar protective effect. Inhaled corticosteroids also increase the risk of cataracts and osteoporosis when a person takes them for a long time. Doctors may prescribe the following medicines on a long-term basis for people with asthma:
1. anti-inflammatory drugs, including cromolyn, which the person takes using a nebulizer
2. immunomodulators, including omalizumab, which a doctor will administer once or twice a month by injection to help reduce reactions to asthma triggers, such as pollen and dust mites
3. inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists, which open the airways and may feature alongside corticosteroids in the medication plan of a person with asthma
4. leukotriene modifiers for blocking the inflammation reaction in the airways
5. theophylline, an oral medication that opens the airways
People should use a quick-relief inhaler for no more than 2 days a week. Most people carry the quick-relief inhaler with them at all times and administer the medication when they first notice symptoms.
Usually, quick-relief medicines do not reduce inflammation, so a person should avoid using them for long-term control of their condition."
"While researchers have explored nonmedical remedies for asthma symptoms, no research is currently available to confirm the effectiveness of anything other than conventional treatment for managing asthma. Nonmedical treatments, as yet unconfirmed, include acupuncture, breathing exercises, and placebo medications. Also, complementary techniques and supplements can interact with conventional medications with potentially harmful effects. They are not a replacement for conventional, medically supervised management of asthma."
"If you feel fatigue, you may need to take Modafinils, Vitamin B Complex and Multivitamins."
"If you feel stressed, you may need to listen to music or take aromatherapy and individual therapy."
"If you feel painful, you may need to take Tramadol, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen."
"If you feel anxious, you may need to take Clonazepam, Alprazolam, Lorazepam."
"If you feel depressed, you may need to take SertralineDuloxetineFluoxetine."
"If you heart beats faster than normal, you may need to take Atenolol, Metoprolol and Metoprolol Succinate ER."
"Asthma is a chronic, long-term disease that causes inflammation and blockage of a person’s airways. While no cure exists, many measures are available that can help people control the condition and improve their quality of life."
"Asthma, also called bronchial asthma, is a disease that affects your lungs. It’s a chronic (ongoing) condition, meaning it doesn’t go away and needs ongoing medical management. Asthma affects more than 25 million people in the U.S. currently. This total includes more than 5 million children. Asthma can be life-threatening if you don’t get treatment."
"When you breathe normally, muscles around your airways are relaxed, letting air move easily and quietly. During an asthma attack, three things can happen:

Bronchospasm: The muscles around the airways constrict (tighten). When they tighten, it makes your airways narrow. Air cannot flow freely through constricted airways.
Inflammation: The lining of your airways becomes swollen. Swollen airways don’t let as much air in or out of your lungs.
Mucus production: During the attack, your body creates more mucus. This thick mucus clogs airways.
When your airways get tighter, you make a sound called wheezing when you breathe, a noise your airways make when you breathe out. You might also hear an asthma attack called an exacerbation or a flare-up. It’s the term for when your asthma isn’t controlled."
Anyone can develop asthma at any age. People with allergies or people exposed to tobacco smoke are more likely to develop asthma. This includes secondhand smoke (exposure to someone else who is smoking) and thirdhand smoke (exposure to clothing or surfaces in places where some has smoked). Statistics show that people assigned female at birth tend to have asthma more than people assigned male at birth. Asthma affects Black people more frequently than other races.
"Researchers don’t know why some people have asthma while others don’t. But certain factors present a higher risk:Allergies: Having allergies can raise your risk of developing asthma. Environmental factors: People can develop asthma after exposure to things that irritate the airways. These substances include allergens, toxins, fumes and second- or third-hand smoke. These can be especially harmful to infants and young children whose immune systems haven’t finished developing. Genetics: If your family has a history of asthma or allergic diseases, you have a higher risk of developing the disease. Respiratory infections: Certain respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can damage young children’s developing lungs."
"You can have an asthma attack if you come in contact with substances that irritate you. Healthcare providers call these substances “triggers.” Knowing what triggers your asthma makes it easier to avoid asthma attacks. For some people, a trigger can bring on an attack right away. For other people, or at other times, an attack may start hours or days later. Triggers can be different for each person. But some common triggers include: Air pollution: Many things outside can cause an asthma attack. Air pollution includes factory emissions, car exhaust, wildfire smoke and more. Dust mites: You can’t see these bugs, but they are in our homes. If you have a dust mite allergy, this can cause an asthma attack. Exercise: For some people, exercising can cause an attack. Mold: Damp places can spawn mold, which can cause problems if you have asthma. You don’t even have to be allergic to mold to have an attack. Pests: Cockroaches, mice and other household pests can cause asthma attacks.
Pets: Your pets can cause asthma attacks. If you’re allergic to pet dander (dried skin flakes), breathing in the dander can irritate your airways. Tobacco smoke: If you or someone in your home smokes, you have a higher risk of developing asthma. You should never smoke in enclosed places like the car or home, and the best solution is to quit smoking. Your provider can help. Strong chemicals or smells. These things can trigger attacks in some people. Certain occupational exposures. You can be exposed to many things at your job, including cleaning products, dust from flour or wood, or other chemicals. These can all be triggers if you have asthma."
"People with asthma usually have obvious symptoms. These signs and symptoms resemble many respiratory infections: Chest tightness, pain or pressure. Coughing (especially at night). Shortness of breath. Wheezing. With asthma, you may not have all of these symptoms with every flare. You can have different symptoms and signs at different times with chronic asthma. Also, symptoms can change between asthma attacks."
"Your healthcare provider will review your medical history, including information about your parents and siblings. Your provider will also ask you about your symptoms. Your provider will need to know any history of allergies, eczema (a bumpy rash caused by allergies) and other lung diseases. Your provider may order spirometry. This test measures airflow through your lungs and is used to diagnose and monitor your progress with treatment. Your healthcare provider may order a chest X-ray, blood test or skin test."
"You have options to help manage your asthma. Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to control symptoms. These include: Bronchodilators: These medicines relax the muscles around your airways. The relaxed muscles let the airways move air. They also let mucus move more easily through the airways. These medicines relieve your symptoms when they happen and are used for intermittent and chronic asthma. Anti-inflammatory medicines: These medicines reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways. They make it easier for air to enter and exit your lungs. Your healthcare provider may prescribe them to take every day to control or prevent your symptoms of chronic asthma.
Biologic therapies for asthma: These are used for severe asthma when symptoms persist despite proper inhaler therapy.
You can take asthma medicines in several different ways. You may breathe in the medicines using a metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer or another type of asthma inhaler. Your healthcare provider may prescribe oral medications that you swallow."
The goal of asthma treatment is to control symptoms. Asthma control means you: Can do the things you want to do at work and home. Have no (or minimal) asthma symptoms. Rarely need to use your reliever medicine (rescue inhaler). Sleep without asthma interrupting your rest.
You should keep track of your asthma symptom. It’s an important piece of managing the disease. Your healthcare provider may ask to use a peak flow (PF) meter. This device measures how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. It can help your provider make adjustments to your medication. It also tells you if your symptoms are getting worse.
"If your healthcare provider says you have asthma, you’ll need to figure out what triggers an attack. Avoiding the triggers can help you avoid an attack. You can’t prevent yourself from getting asthma, though."
"If you have asthma, you can still live a very productive life and participate in sports and other activities. Your healthcare provider can help you manage symptoms, learn your triggers and prevent or manage attacks."
Your healthcare provider will work with you to develop an asthma action plan. This plan tells you how and when to use your medicines. It also tells you what to do based on your asthma symptoms and when to seek emergency care. Ask your healthcare provider about anything you don’t understand.
"If you have a severe asthma attack, you need to get immediate medical care. The first thing you should do is use your rescue inhaler. A rescue inhaler uses fast-acting medicines to open up your airways. It’s different than a maintenance inhaler, which you use every day. You should use the rescue inhaler when symptoms are bothering you and you can use it more frequently if your flare is severe. If your rescue inhaler doesn’t help or you don’t have it with you, go to the emergency department if you have:
Anxiety or panic.
Bluish fingernails, bluish lips (in light-skinned people) or gray or whitish lips or gums (in dark-skinned people).
Chest pain or pressure.
Coughing that won’t stop or severe wheezing when you breathe.
Difficulty talking.
Pale, sweaty face.
Very quick or rapid breathing."
"Contact your doctor
See your doctor:
If you think you have asthma. If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from getting worse over time.
To monitor your asthma after diagnosis. If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack.
If your asthma symptoms get worse. Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often.

Don't take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse.

To review your treatment. Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments."
"Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs.[3] It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms.[9][10] Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.[2] These may occur a few times a day or a few times per week.[3] Depending on the person, asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise.[3]

Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.[4] Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens.[3] Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers.[3] Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry lung function testing.[5] Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.[11] It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.[12][13]

There is no known cure for asthma, but it is easily treatable.[3] Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and respiratory irritants, and suppressed with the use of inhaled corticosteroids.[6][14] Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled.[15][16] Treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth.[7] In very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required.[17]

In 2019 asthma affected approximately 262 million people and caused approximately 461,000 deaths.[8] Most of the deaths occurred in the developing world.[3] Asthma often begins in childhood,[3] and the rates have increased significantly since the 1960s.[18] Asthma was recognized as early as Ancient Egypt.[19] The word ""asthma"" is from the Greek ἄσθμα, ásthma, which means ""panting"".[20]"

"Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[21] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[22] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[23] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[24] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[25]

Associated conditions
A number of other health conditions occur more frequently in people with asthma, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), rhinosinusitis, and obstructive sleep apnea.[26] Psychological disorders are also more common,[27] with anxiety disorders occurring in between 16 and 52% and mood disorders in 14–41%.[28] It is not known whether asthma causes psychological problems or psychological problems lead to asthma.[29] Current asthma, but not former asthma, is associated with increased all-cause mortality, heart disease mortality, and chronic lower respiratory tract disease mortality.[30] Asthma, particularly severe asthma, is strongly associated with development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).[31][32][33] Those with asthma, especially if it is poorly controlled, are at increased risk for radiocontrast reactions.[34]

Cavities occur more often in people with asthma.[35] This may be related to the effect of beta 2 agonists decreasing saliva.[36] These medications may also increase the risk of dental erosions.[36]"
You’ll need to see a healthcare provider to find out if you have asthma or some other condition. There are other respiratory diseases that make it hard to breathe or cause coughing and wheezing.
"Asthma that gets worse at night is sometimes called nighttime asthma or nocturnal asthma. There are no definite reasons that this happens, but there are some educated guesses. These include:

The way you sleep: Sleeping on your back can result in mucus dripping into your throat or acid reflux coming back up from your stomach. Also, sleeping on your back puts pressure on your chest and lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. However, lying face down or on your side can put pressure on your lungs.
Triggers in your bedroom and triggers that happen in the evening: You may find your blankets, sheets and pillows have dust mites, mold or pet hair on them. If you’ve been outside in the early evening, you may have brought pollen in with you.
Medication side effects: Some drugs that treat asthma, such as steroids and montelukast, can affect your sleep.
Air that’s too hot or too cold: Hot air can cause airways to narrow when you breathe in. Cold air is an asthma trigger for some people.
Lung function changes: Lung function lessens at night as a natural process.
Asthma is poorly controlled during the day: Symptoms that aren’t controlled during the day won’t be better at night. It’s important to work with your provider to make sure your asthma symptoms are controlled both day and night. Treating nighttime symptoms is very important. Serious asthma attacks, and sometimes deaths, can happen at night."
"If you have asthma that is moderate-to-severe, or if your asthma symptoms aren’t well controlled, you’re at greater risk of having to be hospitalized if you get COVID-19. Therefore, you should wear a mask if you go to indoor spaces with other people, get vaccinated and avoid exposure to people who have the virus."
"Common asthma signs and symptoms in children ages 5 to 11 include:

Coughing, particularly at night
Wheezing
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain, tightness or discomfort
Avoiding or losing interest in sports or physical activities
Some children have few day-to-day symptoms, but have severe asthma attacks now and then. Other children have mild symptoms or symptoms that get worse at certain times. You may notice that your child's asthma symptoms get worse at night, with activity, when your child has a cold, or with triggers such as cigarette smoke or seasonal allergies."
"Risk factors
A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. They include:

Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling
Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis — which causes red, itchy skin — or hay fever — which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes
Being overweight
Being a smoker
Exposure to secondhand smoke
Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution
Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing"
"Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening and require a trip to the emergency room. Signs and symptoms of an asthma emergency in children ages 5 to 11 include:

Significant trouble breathing
Persistent coughing or wheezing
No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)
Being unable to speak without gasping
Peak flow meter readings in the red zone"
"For children 5 years of age and older, doctors can diagnose and monitor asthma with the same tests used for adults, such as spirometry and peak flow meters. They measure how much air your child can quickly force out of his or her lungs, an indication of how well the lungs are working.

"
"The doctor may give your child a portable, hand-held device (peak flow meter) to measure how well his or her lungs are working. A peak flow meter measures how much air your child can quickly exhale.

Low readings indicate worsening asthma. You and your child may notice low peak flow readings before symptoms become apparent. This will help you recognize when to adjust treatment to prevent an asthma flare-up."
"If your child's asthma symptoms are severe, your family doctor or pediatrician may refer your child to see an asthma specialist.

The doctor will want your child to take just the right amount and type of medication needed to control his or her asthma. This will help prevent side effects.

Based on your record of how well your child's current medications seem to control signs and symptoms, your child's doctor may ""step up"" treatment to a higher dose or add another type of medication. If your child's asthma is well controlled, the doctor may ""step down"" treatment by reducing your child's medications. This is known as the stepwise approach to asthma treatment."
"Known as maintenance medications, these are generally taken every day on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma. These medications may be used seasonally if your child's asthma symptoms become worse during certain times of the year.

Types of long-term control medications include:

Inhaled corticosteroids. These are the most common long-term control medications for asthma. These anti-inflammatory drugs include fluticasone (Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), beclomethasone (Qvar RediHaler), ciclesonide (Alvesco, Omnaris) and mometasone (Asmanex HFA).
Leukotriene modifiers. These include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo). They can be used alone or as an addition to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.

In rare cases, montelukast and zileuton have been linked to psychological reactions such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away if your child has any unusual psychological reaction.

Combination inhalers. These medications contain an inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting beta agonist (LABA). They include the combinations fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair HFA), budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), fluticasone-vilanterol (Breo, Ellipta) and mometasone-formoterol (Dulera). In some situations, long-acting beta agonists have been linked to severe asthma attacks.

LABA medications should only be given to children when they are combined with a corticosteroid in a combination inhaler. This reduces the risk of a severe asthma attack.

Theophylline. This is a daily medication that opens the airways (bronchodilator). Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin) is not used as often now as in past years.
Biologics. Nucala, an injectable medication, is given to children every four weeks to help control severe asthma. Children age 6 and older may benefit from the addition of this therapy to their current treatment plan."
"These medications — called short-acting bronchodilators — provide immediate relief of asthma symptoms and last four to six hours. Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) is the most commonly used short-acting bronchodilator for asthma. Levalbuterol (Xopenex) is another.

Although these medications work quickly, they can't keep your child's symptoms from coming back. If your child has frequent or severe symptoms, he or she will need to take a long-term control medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid.

Your child's asthma is not under control if he or she often needs to use a quick-relief inhaler. Relying on a quick-relief inhaler to control symptoms puts your child at risk of a severe asthma attack and is a sign that your child needs to see the doctor about making treatment changes. Track the use of quick-relief medications, and share the information with your child's doctor at every visit.

Asthma attacks are treated with rescue medications, and oral or injectable corticosteroids."
"Most asthma medications are given with a device that allows a child to breathe medication directly into the lungs. Your child's medication may be delivered with one of these devices:

Metered dose inhaler. Small hand-held devices, metered dose inhalers are a common delivery method for asthma medication. To make sure your child gets the correct dose, he or she may also need a hollow tube (spacer) that attaches to the inhaler.
Dry powder inhalers. For certain asthma medications, your child may have a dry powder inhaler. This device requires a deep, rapid inhalation to get the full dose of medication.
Nebulizer. A nebulizer turns medications into a fine mist your child breathes in through a face mask. Nebulizers can deliver larger doses of medications into the lungs than inhalers can. Young children often need to use a nebulizer because it's difficult or impossible for them to use other inhaler devices."
"Allergy-desensitization shots (immunotherapy) may help if your child has allergic asthma that can't be easily controlled by avoiding asthma triggers. Your child will begin with skin tests to determine which allergy-causing substances (allergens) may trigger asthma symptoms.

Once your child's asthma triggers are identified, he or she will get a series of injections containing small doses of those allergens. Your son or daughter will probably need injections once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years. Your child's allergic reactions and asthma symptoms should gradually diminish.

Omalizumab (Xolair) is an injectable treatment that can help allergic asthma that isn't well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids."
"Managing your child's asthma can seem like an overwhelming responsibility. Following these steps will help make it easier.

Learn about asthma
A critical part of managing your child's asthma is learning exactly what steps to take on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis. It's also important that you understand the purpose of each part of tracking symptoms and adjusting treatment. You, your child and caretakers need to:

Understand the different types of medications for asthma and how they work
Learn to recognize and record signs and symptoms of worsening asthma
Know what to do when your child's asthma gets worse
Track symptoms with a written plan
A written asthma action plan is an important tool to let you know how well treatment is working, based on your child's symptoms. With your child's doctor, create a written asthma plan that outlines the steps needed to manage your child's asthma. You and your child's caretakers, including babysitters, teachers and coaches, should have a copy of the plan.

The plan can help you and your child:

Track how often your child has asthma flare-ups (exacerbations)
Judge how well medications are controlling symptoms
Note any medication side effects, such as shaking, irritability or trouble sleeping
Check how well your child's lungs are working with a peak flow meter
Measure how much your child's symptoms affect daily activities such as play, sleep and sports
Adjust medications when symptoms get worse
Recognize when to see a doctor or seek emergency care
Many asthma plans use a stoplight system of green, yellow and red zones that correspond to worsening symptoms. This system can help you quickly determine asthma severity and identify signs of an asthma attack. Some asthma plans use a symptoms questionnaire called the Asthma Control Test to measure asthma severity over the past month.

Control asthma triggers
Taking steps to help your child avoid triggers is an important part of controlling asthma. Asthma triggers vary from child to child. Work with your child's doctor to identify triggers and steps you can take to help your child avoid them. Common asthma triggers include:

Colds or other respiratory infections
Allergens such as dust mites or pollen
Pet dander
Exercise
Cold weather
Mold and dampness
Cockroach exposure
Cigarette smoke and other irritants in the air
Severe heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD)"
"Other drugs are used in asthma treatment uncommonly and in specific circumstances. Magnesium is often used in the emergency department, but it is not recommended in the management of chronic asthma.

Immunotherapy may be indicated when symptoms are triggered by allergy, as suggested by history and confirmed by allergy testing. Immunotherapy is generally more effective in children than adults. If symptoms are not significantly relieved after 24 months, then therapy is stopped. If symptoms are relieved, therapy should continue for ≥ 3 years, although the optimum duration is unknown.

Other drugs that suppress the immune system are occasionally given to reduce dependence on high-dose oral corticosteroids, but these drugs have a significant risk of toxicity. Low-dose methotrexate (5 to 15 mg orally or IM once a week) can lead to modest improvements in FEV1 and modest decreases in daily oral corticosteroid use. Gold and cyclosporine are also modestly effective, but toxicity and need for monitoring limit their use.

Other therapies for management of chronic asthma include nebulized lidocaine, nebulized heparin, colchicine, and high-dose IV immune globulin. Limited evidence supports the use of any of these therapies, and their benefits are unproved, so none are currently recommended for routine clinical use."
"Beta agonists
Beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists and beta agonists relax bronchial smooth muscle, decrease mast cell degranulation and histamine release, inhibit microvascular leakage into the airways, and increase mucociliary clearance. Beta-2 agonist preparations may be short-acting, long-acting, or ultra–long-acting (see tables Drug Treatment of Chronic Asthma and Drug Treatment of Asthma Exacerbations).

Short-acting beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol) 2 puffs every 4 hours inhaled as needed are the drug of choice for relieving acute bronchoconstriction and preventing exercise-induced asthma. They should not be used alone for long-term maintenance of chronic asthma. They take effect within minutes and are active for up to 6 to 8 hours, depending on the drug. Tachycardia and tremor are the most common acute adverse effects of inhaled beta agonists and are dose-related. Mild hypokalemia occurs uncommonly. Use of levalbuterol (a solution containing the R-isomer of albuterol) theoretically minimizes adverse effects, but its long-term efficacy and safety are unproved. Oral beta agonists have more systemic effects and generally should be avoided.

Long-acting beta agonists (eg, salmeterol) are active for up to 12 hours. They are used for moderate and severe asthma but should never be used as monotherapy. They interact synergistically with inhaled corticosteroids and permit lower dosing of corticosteroids.

Ultra-long-acting beta agonists (eg, indacaterol) are active for up to 24 hours and as with long-acting beta agonists are used for moderate to severe asthma, and should never be used as a monotherapy. They interact synergistically with inhaled corticosteroids and permit lower dosing of corticosteroids.

The safety of regular long-term use of beta agonists has been confirmed by multiple randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses, including a large international safety study that was followed by removal of a black box warning by the Food and Drug Administration (1). Because the safety and efficacy of long-acting beta agonists have been demonstrated only when used in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid, all long-acting and ultra-long beta agonists should be used only in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid for patients whose condition is not adequately controlled with other asthma controllers (eg, low- to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly warrants additional maintenance therapies. Daily use or diminishing effects of short-acting beta agonists or use of ≥ 1 canister per month suggests inadequate control and the need to begin or intensify other therapies."
"
Asthma is a disease that affects your lungs. It is one of the most common long-term diseases of children, but adults can have asthma, too. Asthma causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing at night or early in the morning. If you have asthma, you have it all the time, but you will have asthma attacks only when something bothers your lungs.

We don’t know all the things that can cause asthma, but we do know that genetic, environmental, and occupational factors have been linked to developing asthma.

If someone in your immediate family has asthma, you are more likely to have it. “Atopy,” the genetic tendency to develop an allergic disease, can play a big part in developing allergic asthma. However, not all asthma is allergic asthma.

Being exposed to things in the environment, like mold or dampness, some allergens such as dust mites, and secondhand tobacco smoke have been linked to developing asthma. Air pollution and viral lung infection may also lead to asthma.

Occupational asthma occurs when someone who never had asthma develops it because he or she is exposed to something at work. This can happen if you develop an allergy to something at work such as mold or if you are exposed to irritants such as wood dust or chemicals at work over and over at lower levels or all at once at higher levels."
"
It can be hard to tell if someone has asthma, especially in children under age 5. Having a doctor check how well your lungs work and check for allergies can help you find out if you have asthma.

During a checkup, a doctor will ask if you cough a lot, especially at night. He or she will also ask whether your breathing problems are worse after physical activity or at certain times of year. The doctor will then ask about chest tightness, wheezing, and colds lasting more than 10 days. He or she will ask whether anyone in your family has or has had asthma, allergies, or other breathing problems. Finally, the doctor will ask questions about your home and whether you have missed school or work or have trouble doing certain things.

The doctor may also do a breathing test, called spirometry, to find out how well your lungs are working by testing how much air you can breathe out after taking a very deep breath before and after you use asthma medicine."
"An asthma attack may include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, and trouble breathing. The attack happens in your body’s airways, which are the paths that carry air to your lungs. As the air moves through your lungs, the airways become smaller, like the branches of a tree are smaller than the tree trunk. During an asthma attack, the sides of the airways in your lungs swell and the airways shrink. Less air gets in and out of your lungs, and mucous that your body makes clogs up the airways.

You can control your asthma by knowing the warning signs of an asthma attack, staying away from things that cause an attack, and following your doctor’s advice. When you control your asthma:

you won’t have symptoms such as wheezing or coughing,
you’ll sleep better,
you won’t miss work or school,
you can take part in all physical activities, and
you won’t have to go to the hospital."
"An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to “asthma triggers.” Your asthma triggers can be very different from someone else’s asthma triggers. Know your triggers and learn how to avoid them. Watch out for an attack when you can’t avoid your triggers. Some of the most common triggers are tobacco smoke, dust mites, outdoor air pollution, cockroach allergen, pets, mold, smoke from burning wood or grass, and infections like flu."
"Take your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you and stay away from things that can trigger an attack to control your asthma.

Everyone with asthma does not take the same medicine.

You can breathe in some medicines and take other medicines as a pill. Asthma medicines come in two types—quick-relief and long-term control. Quick-relief medicines control the symptoms of an asthma attack. If you need to use your quick-relief medicines more and more, visit your doctor to see if you need a different medicine. Long-term control medicines help you have fewer and milder attacks, but they don’t help you while you are having an asthma attack.

Asthma medicines can have side effects, but most side effects are mild and soon go away. Ask your doctor about the side effects of your medicines.

Remember – you can control your asthma. With your doctor’s help, make your own asthma action plan. Decide who should have a copy of your plan and where he or she should keep it. Take your long-term control medicine even when you don’t have symptoms."
"Doing Well
I don’t have cough, wheezing, chest tightness, or trouble breathing at any time.
I can do all the things I usually do.
When I use a peak flow meter my peak flow* is more than 80 percent or more of my best peak flow.

If your symptoms don’t get better and you can’t reach your doctor, go to the hospital."
"Asthma is caused by a combination of complex and incompletely understood environmental and genetic interactions.[4][37] These influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment.[38] It is believed that the recent increased rates of asthma are due to changing epigenetics (heritable factors other than those related to the DNA sequence) and a changing living environment.[39] Asthma that starts before the age of 12 years old is more likely due to genetic influence, while onset after age 12 is more likely due to environmental influence.[40]"
"Many environmental factors have been associated with asthma's development and exacerbation, including, allergens, air pollution, and other environmental chemicals.[41] Smoking during pregnancy and after delivery is associated with a greater risk of asthma-like symptoms.[42] Low air quality from environmental factors such as traffic pollution or high ozone levels[43] has been associated with both asthma development and increased asthma severity.[44] Over half of cases in children in the United States occur in areas when air quality is below the EPA standards.[45] Low air quality is more common in low-income and minority communities.[46]

Exposure to indoor volatile organic compounds may be a trigger for asthma; formaldehyde exposure, for example, has a positive association.[47] Phthalates in certain types of PVC are associated with asthma in both children and adults.[48][49] While exposure to pesticides is linked to the development of asthma, a cause and effect relationship has yet to be established.[50][51]

The majority of the evidence does not support a causal role between acetaminophen (paracetamol) or antibiotic use and asthma.[52][53] A 2014 systematic review found that the association between acetaminophen use and asthma disappeared when respiratory infections were taken into account.[54] Acetaminophen use by a mother during pregnancy is also associated with an increased risk of the child developing asthma.[55] Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy is a risk factor for the child to develop asthma.[56]

Asthma is associated with exposure to indoor allergens.[57] Common indoor allergens include dust mites, cockroaches, animal dander (fragments of fur or feathers), and mold.[58][59] Efforts to decrease dust mites have been found to be ineffective on symptoms in sensitized subjects.[60][61] Weak evidence suggests that efforts to decrease mold by repairing buildings may help improve asthma symptoms in adults.[62] Certain viral respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus,[20] may increase the risk of developing asthma when acquired as young children.[63] Certain other infections, however, may decrease the risk.[20]"
"The hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses.[64][65] It has been proposed that the reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses is due, in part, to increased cleanliness and decreased family size in modern societies.[66] Exposure to bacterial endotoxin in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction.[67] Evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of asthma on farms and in households with pets.[66]

Use of antibiotics in early life has been linked to the development of asthma.[68] Also, delivery via caesarean section is associated with an increased risk (estimated at 20–80%) of asthma – this increased risk is attributed to the lack of healthy bacterial colonization that the newborn would have acquired from passage through the birth canal.[69][70] There is a link between asthma and the degree of affluence which may be related to the hygiene hypothesis as less affluent individuals often have more exposure to bacteria and viruses.[71]"
"Family history is a risk factor for asthma, with many different genes being implicated.[73] If one identical twin is affected, the probability of the other having the disease is approximately 25%.[73] By the end of 2005, 25 genes had been associated with asthma in six or more separate populations, including GSTM1, IL10, CTLA-4, SPINK5, LTC4S, IL4R and ADAM33, among others.[74] Many of these genes are related to the immune system or modulating inflammation. Even among this list of genes supported by highly replicated studies, results have not been consistent among all populations tested.[74] In 2006 over 100 genes were associated with asthma in one genetic association study alone;[74] more continue to be found.[75]

Some genetic variants may only cause asthma when they are combined with specific environmental exposures.[4] An example is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism in the CD14 region and exposure to endotoxin (a bacterial product). Endotoxin exposure can come from several environmental sources including tobacco smoke, dogs, and farms. Risk for asthma, then, is determined by both a person's genetics and the level of endotoxin exposure.[72]"
"A triad of atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis and asthma is called atopy.[76] The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease;[63] with asthma occurring at a much greater rate in those who have either eczema or hay fever.[77] Asthma has been associated with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg–Strauss syndrome), an autoimmune disease and vasculitis.[78] Individuals with certain types of urticaria may also experience symptoms of asthma.[76]

There is a correlation between obesity and the risk of asthma with both having increased in recent years.[79][80] Several factors may be at play including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of fat and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state.[81]

Beta blocker medications such as propranolol can trigger asthma in those who are susceptible.[82] Cardioselective beta-blockers, however, appear safe in those with mild or moderate disease.[83][84] Other medications that can cause problems in asthmatics are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and NSAIDs.[85] Use of acid suppressing medication (proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers) during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma in the child.[86]"
"Some individuals will have stable asthma for weeks or months and then suddenly develop an episode of acute asthma. Different individuals react to various factors in different ways.[87] Most individuals can develop severe exacerbation from a number of triggering agents.[87]

Home factors that can lead to exacerbation of asthma include dust, animal dander (especially cat and dog hair), cockroach allergens and mold.[87][88] Perfumes are a common cause of acute attacks in women and children. Both viral and bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract can worsen the disease.[87] Psychological stress may worsen symptoms – it is thought that stress alters the immune system and thus increases the airway inflammatory response to allergens and irritants.[44][89]

Asthma exacerbations in school‐aged children peak in autumn, shortly after children return to school. This might reflect a combination of factors, including poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and altered immune tolerance. There is limited evidence to guide possible approaches to reducing autumn exacerbations, but while costly, seasonal omalizumab treatment from four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations.[90]"
"Asthma is the result of chronic inflammation of the conducting zone of the airways (most especially the bronchi and bronchioles), which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding smooth muscles. This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing. The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment. Occasionally the airways themselves change.[21] Typical changes in the airways include an increase in eosinophils and thickening of the lamina reticularis. Chronically the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands. Other cell types involved include T lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. There may also be involvement of other components of the immune system, including cytokines, chemokines, histamine, and leukotrienes among others.[20]"
"While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[20] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as ""a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment"".[21]

There is currently no precise test for the diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time.[5][20] Asthma may be suspected if there is a history of recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution.[91] Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis.[91] In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry.[92]

Spirometry
Spirometry is recommended to aid in diagnosis and management.[93][94] It is the single best test for asthma. If the FEV1 measured by this technique improves more than 12% and increases by at least 200 milliliters following administration of a bronchodilator such as salbutamol, this is supportive of the diagnosis. It however may be normal in those with a history of mild asthma, not currently acting up.[20] As caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma, the use of caffeine before a lung function test may interfere with the results.[95] Single-breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from COPD.[20] It is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person's asthma is controlled.[96]

Others
The methacholine challenge involves the inhalation of increasing concentrations of a substance that causes airway narrowing in those predisposed. If negative it means that a person does not have asthma; if positive, however, it is not specific for the disease.[20]

Other supportive evidence includes: a ≥20% difference in peak expiratory flow rate on at least three days in a week for at least two weeks, a ≥20% improvement of peak flow following treatment with either salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids or prednisone, or a ≥20% decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger.[97] Testing peak expiratory flow is more variable than spirometry, however, and thus not recommended for routine diagnosis. It may be useful for daily self-monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for checking the effectiveness of new medications. It may also be helpful in guiding treatment in those with acute exacerbations.[98]"
"Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.[11] Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic), based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens (atopic) or not (non-atopic).[12] While asthma is classified based on severity, at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system.[99] Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research.[99]

Although asthma is a chronic obstructive condition, it is not considered as a part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as this term refers specifically to combinations of disease that are irreversible such as bronchiectasis and emphysema.[100] Unlike these diseases, the airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible; however, if left untreated, the chronic inflammation from asthma can lead the lungs to become irreversibly obstructed due to airway remodeling.[101] In contrast to emphysema, asthma affects the bronchi, not the alveoli.[102] The combination of asthma with a component of irreversible airways obstruction has been termed the asthma-chronic obstructive disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS). Compared to other people with ""pure"" asthma or COPD, people with ACOS exhibit increased morbidity, mortality and possibly more comorbidities.[103]"
"An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an asthma attack. The classic symptoms are shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness.[20] The wheezing is most often when breathing out.[105] While these are the primary symptoms of asthma,[106] some people present primarily with coughing, and in severe cases, air motion may be significantly impaired such that no wheezing is heard.[104] In children, chest pain is often present.[107]

Signs occurring during an asthma attack include the use of accessory muscles of respiration (sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles of the neck), there may be a paradoxical pulse (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation), and over-inflation of the chest.[108] A blue color of the skin and nails may occur from lack of oxygen.[109]

In a mild exacerbation the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is ≥200 L/min, or ≥50% of the predicted best.[110] Moderate is defined as between 80 and 200 L/min, or 25% and 50% of the predicted best, while severe is defined as ≤ 80 L/min, or ≤25% of the predicted best.[110]

Acute severe asthma, previously known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators and corticosteroids.[111] Half of cases are due to infections with others caused by allergen, air pollution, or insufficient or inappropriate medication use.[111]

Brittle asthma is a kind of asthma distinguishable by recurrent, severe attacks.[104] Type 1 brittle asthma is a disease with wide peak flow variability, despite intense medication. Type 2 brittle asthma is background well-controlled asthma with sudden severe exacerbations.[104]"
"Exercise can trigger bronchoconstriction both in people with or without asthma.[112] It occurs in most people with asthma and up to 20% of people without asthma.[112] Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is common in professional athletes. The highest rates are among cyclists (up to 45%), swimmers, and cross-country skiers.[113] While it may occur with any weather conditions, it is more common when it is dry and cold.[114] Inhaled beta2-agonists do not appear to improve athletic performance among those without asthma,[115] however, oral doses may improve endurance and strength.[116][117]"
"Asthma as a result of (or worsened by) workplace exposures is a commonly reported occupational disease.[118] Many cases, however, are not reported or recognized as such.[119][120] It is estimated that 5–25% of asthma cases in adults are work-related. A few hundred different agents have been implicated, with the most common being: isocyanates, grain and wood dust, colophony, soldering flux, latex, animals, and aldehydes. The employment associated with the highest risk of problems include: those who spray paint, bakers and those who process food, nurses, chemical workers, those who work with animals, welders, hairdressers and timber workers.[118]

Aspirin-induced asthma
Main article: Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease
Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also known as aspirin-induced asthma, affects up to 9% of asthmatics.[121] AERD consists of asthma, nasal polyps, sinus disease, and respiratory reactions to aspirin and other NSAID medications (such as ibuprofen and naproxen).[122] People often also develop loss of smell and most experience respiratory reactions to alcohol.[123]

Alcohol-induced asthma
Main article: Alcohol-induced respiratory reactions
Alcohol may worsen asthmatic symptoms in up to a third of people.[124] This may be even more common in some ethnic groups such as the Japanese and those with aspirin-induced asthma.[124] Other studies have found improvement in asthmatic symptoms from alcohol.[124]

Non-atopic asthma
Non-atopic asthma, also known as intrinsic or non-allergic, makes up between 10 and 33% of cases. There is negative skin test to common inhalant allergens. Often it starts later in life, and women are more commonly affected than men. Usual treatments may not work as well.[125] The concept that ""non-atopic"" is synonymous with ""non-allergic"" is called into question by epidemiological data that the prevalence of asthma is closely related to the serum IgE level standardized for age and sex (P<0.0001), indicating that asthma is almost always associated with some sort of IgE-related reaction and therefore has an allergic basis, although not all the allergic stimuli that cause asthma appear to have been included in the battery of aeroallergens studied (the ""missing antigen(s)"" hypothesis).[126] For example, an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of population-attributable risk (PAR) of Chlamydia pneumoniae biomarkers in chronic asthma found that the PAR for C. pneumoniae-specific IgE was 47%.[127]

Infectious asthma
When queried, asthma patients may report that their first asthma symptoms began after an acute lower respiratory tract illness. This type of history has been labelled the ""infectious asthma"" (IA) syndrome,[128] or as ""asthma associated with infection"" (AAWI)[129] to distinguish infection-associated asthma initiation from the well known association of respiratory infections with asthma exacerbations. Reported prevalences of IA for adults range from around 40% in a primary care practice[128] to 70% in a specialty practice treating mainly severe asthma patients.[130] The true population prevalence of IA in adult-onset asthma is unknown because clinicians are not trained to elicit this type of history routinely, and recollection in child-onset asthma is challenging.

Differential diagnosis
Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[131] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[132] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[131]

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma. After the age of 65, most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD. In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi. However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and smoking cessation.[133] It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.[134][135]

Prevention
The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[136] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[137][138] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[136]

Early pet exposure may be useful.[139] Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive[140] and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet.[141]

Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective at preventing asthma in children and are not recommended.[141] Omega-3 consumption, mediterranean diet and anti-oxidants have been suggested by some studies that might help preventing crisis but the evidence is still inconclusive.[142]

Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective.[118] It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affects the risk of exacerbations.[143] Immunization, however, is recommended by the World Health Organization.[144] Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma.[145]

Management
While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved.[146] The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, pets, or aspirin, and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended. Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories.[147][148] The medications listed below have demonstrated efficacy in improving asthma symptoms, however ""real world"" use-effectiveness is limited as around half of people with asthma worldwide remain sub-optimally controlled, even when treated.[149][150][151] People with asthma may remain sub-optimally controlled either because optimum doses of asthma medications do not work (called ""refractory"" asthma) or because individuals are either unable (e.g. inability to afford treatment, poor inhaler technique) or unwilling (e.g., wish to avoid side effects of corticosteroids) to take optimum doses of prescribed asthma medications (called ""difficult to treat"" asthma). In practice, it is not possible to distinguish ""refractory"" from ""difficult to treat"" categories for patients who have never taken optimum doses of asthma medications. A related issue is that the asthma efficacy trials upon which the pharmacological treatment guidelines are based have systematically excluded the majority of people with asthma.[152][153] For example, asthma efficacy treatment trials always exclude otherwise eligible people who smoke, and smoking blunts the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, the mainstay of asthma control management.[154][155][156]

Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer by mouth is recommended. For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, corticosteroids by mouth are added to these treatments.[7]

People with asthma have higher rates of anxiety, psychological stress, and depression.[157][158] This is associated with poorer asthma control.[157] Cognitive behavioral therapy may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels in people with asthma.[157]

Improving people's knowledge about asthma and using a written action plan has been identified as an important component of managing asthma.[159] Providing educational sessions that include information specific to a person's culture is likely effective.[160] More research is necessary to determine if increasing preparedness and knowledge of asthma among school staff and families using home-based and school interventions results in long term improvements in safety for children with asthma.[161][162][163] School-based asthma self-management interventions, which attempt to improve knowledge of asthma, its triggers and the importance of regular practitioner review, may reduce hospital admissions and emergency department visits. These interventions may also reduce the number of days children experience asthma symptoms and may lead to small improvements in asthma-related quality of life.[164] More research is necessary to determine if shared-decision-making is helpful for managing adults with asthma[165] or if a personalized asthma action plan is effective and necessary.[166] Some people with asthma use pulse oximeters to monitor their own blood oxygen levels during an asthma attack. However, there is no evidence regarding the use in these instances.[167]

Lifestyle modification
Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks. The most common triggers include allergens, smoke (from tobacco or other sources), air pollution, non selective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods.[168][169] Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids.[170] Laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma.[145] Dust mite control measures, including air filtration, chemicals to kill mites, vacuuming, mattress covers and others methods had no effect on asthma symptoms.[60] There is insufficient evidence to suggest that dehumidifiers are helpful for controlling asthma.[171]

Overall, exercise is beneficial in people with stable asthma.[172] Yoga could provide small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.[173] More research is necessary to determine how effective weight loss is on improving quality of life, the usage of health care services, and adverse effects for people of all ages with asthma.[174][175]

Medications
Medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms; and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation.[147] Antibiotics are generally not needed for sudden worsening of symptoms or for treating asthma at any time.[176][177]"
"Short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (SABA), such as salbutamol (albuterol USAN) are the first line treatment for asthma symptoms.[7] They are recommended before exercise in those with exercise induced symptoms.[178]
Anticholinergic medications, such as ipratropium, provide additional benefit when used in combination with SABA in those with moderate or severe symptoms and may prevent hospitalizations.[7][179][180] Anticholinergic bronchodilators can also be used if a person cannot tolerate a SABA.[100] If a child requires admission to hospital additional ipratropium does not appear to help over a SABA.[181] For children over 2 years old with acute asthma symptoms, inhaled anticholinergic medications taken alone is safe but is not as effective as inhaled SABA or SABA combined with inhaled anticholinergic medication.[182][179] Adults who receive combined inhaled medications that includes short-acting anticholinergics and SABA may be at risk for increased adverse effects such as experiencing a tremor, agitation, and heart beat palpitations compared to people who are treated with SABA by itself.[180]
Older, less selective adrenergic agonists, such as inhaled epinephrine, have similar efficacy to SABAs.[183] They are however not recommended due to concerns regarding excessive cardiac stimulation.[184]
Corticosteroids can also help with the acute phase of an exacerbation because of their antiinflamatory properties. The benefit of systemic and oral corticosteroids is well established. Inhaled or nebulized corticosteroids can also be used.[142]For adults and children who are in the hospital due to acute asthma, systemic (IV) corticosteroids improve symptoms.[185][186] A short course of corticosteroids after an acute asthma exacerbation may help prevent relapses and reduce hospitalizations.[187]
Other remedies, less established, are intravenous or nebulized magnesium sulfate and helium mixed with oxygen. Aminophylline could be used with caution as well.[142]
Mechanical ventilation is the last resort in case of severe hypoxemia.[142]
Intravenous administration of the drug aminophylline does not provide an improvement in bronchodilation when compared to standard inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment.[188] Aminophylline treatment is associated with more adverse effects compared to inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment.[188]"
"Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control.[147] Inhaled forms are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed.[147] Dosage depends on the severity of symptoms.[189] High dosage and long term use might lead to the appearance of common adverse effects which are growth delay, adrenal suppression, and osteoporosis.[142] Continuous (daily) use of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than its intermitted use, seems to provide better results in controlling asthma exacerbations.[142] Commonly used corticosteroids are budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide.[142]
Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.[190][191] In children this benefit is uncertain.[190][192][191] When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects,[193] and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.[194][195] Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations.[196] Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.[196]
Leukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast) may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, typically also in conjunction with a LABA.[16][197][198][199] For adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well, the addition of anti-leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces the risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.[198] Anti-leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults, however there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti-leukotriene receptor alone.[200] In those under five years of age, anti-leukotriene agents were the preferred add-on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids.[142][201] A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children.[202] A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.[16][203] As of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.[16]
Mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are safe alternatives to corticosteroids but not preferred because they have to be administered frequently.[147][16]
Oral Theophyllines are sometimes used for controlling chronic asthma, but their used is minimized because of their side effects.[142]
Omalizumab, a monoclonal Antibody Against IgE, is a novel way to lessen exacerbations by lessening the levels of circulating IgE that play a significant role at allergic asthma.[142][204]
Anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide have not been shown to be beneficial for treating chronic asthma in children over 2 years old,[205] but is not suggested for routine treatment of chronic asthma in adults.[206]
There is no strong evidence to recommend chloroquine medication as a replacement for taking corticosteroids by mouth (for those who are not able to tolerate inhaled steroids).[207] Methotrexate is not suggested as a replacement for taking corticosteriods by mouth (""steroid sparing"") due to the adverse effects associated with taking methotrexate and the minimal relief provided for asthma symptoms.[208]
Macrolide antibiotics, particularly the azalide macrolide azithromycin, are a recently added GINA-recommended treatment option for both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe, refractory asthma based on azithromycin's efficacy in reducing moderate and severe exacerbations combined.[209][210] Azithromycin's mechanism of action is not established, and could involve pathogen- and/or host-directed anti-inflammatory activities.[211] Limited clinical observations suggest that some patients with new-onset asthma and with ""difficult-to-treat"" asthma (including those with the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome - ACOS) may respond dramatically to azithromycin.[212][213] However, these groups of asthma patients have not been studied in randomized treatment trials and patient selection needs to be carefully individualized.
For children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.[214] In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.[215] Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.[215] Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.[215]

Delivery methods
Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.[216] For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.[217] There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.[218] There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.[219]

Adverse effects
Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.[220] Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth.[220][221][222] Rinsing the mouth after the use of inhaled steroids can decrease the risk of thrush.[223] Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.[224]

Others
Inflammation in the lungs can be estimated by the level of exhaled nitric oxide.[225][226] The use of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO) to guide asthma medication dosing may have small benefits for preventing asthma attacks but the potential benefits are not strong enough for this approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children.[225][226]

When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups. Additional options include:

Humidified Oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.[142]
Corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone.[227] One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids.[228]
Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks.[17][229][230] In adults intravenous treatment results in a reduction of hospital admissions.[231] Low levels of evidence suggest that inhaled (nebulised) magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for treating acute asthma in adults.[232] Overall, high quality evidence do not indicate a large benefit for combining magnesium sulfate with standard inhaled treatments for adults with asthma.[232]
Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.[17]
Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.[233]
Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists.[233] Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.[234]
The dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this.[235]
For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option.[236] It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.[236][237] While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown.[238]
Monoclonal antibody injections such as mepolizumab,[239] dupilumab,[240] or omalizumab may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma.[241] However, as of 2019 these medications are expensive and their use is therefore reserved for those with severe symptoms to achieve cost-effectiveness.[242] Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R), including mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab, in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations. There is limited evidence for improved health-related quality of life and lung function.[243]
Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.[244]
It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.[245]
Alternative medicine
Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[246][247] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies.

Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C or vitamin E for controlling asthma.[248][249] There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced bronchospasm.[250] Fish oil dietary supplements (marine n-3 fatty acids)[251] and reducing dietary sodium[252] do not appear to help improve asthma control. In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations, however, it is not clear if this is only helpful for people who have low vitamin D levels to begin with (low baseline vitamin D).[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplements improve day-to-day asthma symptoms or a person's lung function.[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that adults with asthma should avoid foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG).[254] There have not been enough high-quality studies performed to determine if children with asthma should avoid eating food that contains MSG.[254]

Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use.[255][256] Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.[257] Manual therapies, including osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma.[258] The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.[148] Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use.[255] There is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma.[259]

Prognosis
The prognosis for asthma is generally good, especially for children with mild disease.[260] Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care.[261] In 2010 the death rate was 170 per million for males and 90 per million for females.[262] Rates vary between countries by 100 fold.[262]

Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004 (16 million of which are in low and middle income countries).[263] Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade.[73] Airway remodeling is observed, but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes.[264] Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorates a decline in lung function.[265] Asthma in children also has negative effects on quality of life of their parents.[266]"
"Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control.[147] Inhaled forms are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed.[147] Dosage depends on the severity of symptoms.[189] High dosage and long term use might lead to the appearance of common adverse effects which are growth delay, adrenal suppression, and osteoporosis.[142] Continuous (daily) use of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than its intermitted use, seems to provide better results in controlling asthma exacerbations.[142] Commonly used corticosteroids are budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide.[142] Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.[190][191] In children this benefit is uncertain.[190][192][191] When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects,[193] and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.[194][195] Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations.[196] Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.[196] Leukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast) may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, typically also in conjunction with a LABA.[16][197][198][199] For adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well, the addition of anti-leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces the risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.[198] Anti-leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults, however there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti-leukotriene receptor alone.[200] In those under five years of age, anti-leukotriene agents were the preferred add-on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids.[142][201] A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children.[202] A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.[16][203] As of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.[16] Mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are safe alternatives to corticosteroids but not preferred because they have to be administered frequently.[147][16] Oral Theophyllines are sometimes used for controlling chronic asthma, but their used is minimized because of their side effects.[142] Omalizumab, a monoclonal Antibody Against IgE, is a novel way to lessen exacerbations by lessening the levels of circulating IgE that play a significant role at allergic asthma.[142][204] Anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide have not been shown to be beneficial for treating chronic asthma in children over 2 years old,[205] but is not suggested for routine treatment of chronic asthma in adults.[206] There is no strong evidence to recommend chloroquine medication as a replacement for taking corticosteroids by mouth (for those who are not able to tolerate inhaled steroids).[207] Methotrexate is not suggested as a replacement for taking corticosteriods by mouth (""steroid sparing"") due to the adverse effects associated with taking methotrexate and the minimal relief provided for asthma symptoms.[208] Macrolide antibiotics, particularly the azalide macrolide azithromycin, are a recently added GINA-recommended treatment option for both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe, refractory asthma based on azithromycin's efficacy in reducing moderate and severe exacerbations combined.[209][210] Azithromycin's mechanism of action is not established, and could involve pathogen- and/or host-directed anti-inflammatory activities.[211] Limited clinical observations suggest that some patients with new-onset asthma and with ""difficult-to-treat"" asthma (including those with the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome - ACOS) may respond dramatically to azithromycin.[212][213] However, these groups of asthma patients have not been studied in randomized treatment trials and patient selection needs to be carefully individualized. For children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.[214] In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.[215] Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.[215] Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.[215] Delivery methods Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.[216] For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.[217] There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.[218] There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.[219] Adverse effects Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.[220] Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth.[220][221][222] Rinsing the mouth after the use of inhaled steroids can decrease the risk of thrush.[223] Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.[224] Others Inflammation in the lungs can be estimated by the level of exhaled nitric oxide.[225][226] The use of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO) to guide asthma medication dosing may have small benefits for preventing asthma attacks but the potential benefits are not strong enough for this approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children.[225][226] When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups.

For children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.[214] In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.[215] Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.[215] Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.[215] Delivery methods Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.[216] For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.[217] There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.[218] There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.[219] Adverse effects Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.[220] Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth.[220][221][222] Rinsing the mouth after the use of inhaled steroids can decrease the risk of thrush.[223] Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.[224] Others Inflammation in the lungs can be estimated by the level of exhaled nitric oxide.[225][226] The use of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO) to guide asthma medication dosing may have small benefits for preventing asthma attacks but the potential benefits are not strong enough for this approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children.[225][226] When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups. Additional options include: Humidified Oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.[142] Corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone.[227] One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids.[228] Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks.[17][229][230] In adults intravenous treatment results in a reduction of hospital admissions.[231] Low levels of evidence suggest that inhaled (nebulised) magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for treating acute asthma in adults.[232] Overall, high quality evidence do not indicate a large benefit for combining magnesium sulfate with standard inhaled treatments for adults with asthma.[232] Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.[17] Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.[233] Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists.[233] Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.[234] The dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this.[235] For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option.[236] It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.[236][237] While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown.[238] Monoclonal antibody injections such as mepolizumab,[239] dupilumab,[240] or omalizumab may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma.[241] However, as of 2019 these medications are expensive and their use is therefore reserved for those with severe symptoms to achieve cost-effectiveness.[242] Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R), including mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab, in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations. There is limited evidence for improved health-related quality of life and lung function.[243] Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.[244] It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.[245] Alternative medicine Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[246][247] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies. Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C or vitamin E for controlling asthma.[248][249] There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced bronchospasm.[250] Fish oil dietary supplements (marine n-3 fatty acids)[251] and reducing dietary sodium[252] do not appear to help improve asthma control. In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations, however, it is not clear if this is only helpful for people who have low vitamin D levels to begin with (low baseline vitamin D).[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplements improve day-to-day asthma symptoms or a person's lung function.[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that adults with asthma should avoid foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG).[254] There have not been enough high-quality studies performed to determine if children with asthma should avoid eating food that contains MSG.[254] Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use.[255][256] Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.[257] Manual therapies, including osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma.[258] The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.[148] Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use.[255] There is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma.[259] Prognosis The prognosis for asthma is generally good, especially for children with mild disease.[260] Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care.[261] In 2010 the death rate was 170 per million for males and 90 per million for females.[262] Rates vary between countries by 100 fold.[262] Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004 (16 million of which are in low and middle income countries).[263] Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade.[73] Airway remodeling is observed, but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes.[264] Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorates a decline in lung function.[265] Asthma in children also has negative effects on quality of life of their parents.[266]"

Effects beyond one year are unknown.[238] Monoclonal antibody injections such as mepolizumab,[239] dupilumab,[240] or omalizumab may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma.[241] However, as of 2019 these medications are expensive and their use is therefore reserved for those with severe symptoms to achieve cost-effectiveness.[242] Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R), including mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab, in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations. There is limited evidence for improved health-related quality of life and lung function.[243] Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.[244] It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.[245] Alternative medicine Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[246][247] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies. Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C or vitamin E for controlling asthma.[248][249] There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced bronchospasm.[250] Fish oil dietary supplements (marine n-3 fatty acids)[251] and reducing dietary sodium[252] do not appear to help improve asthma control. In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations, however, it is not clear if this is only helpful for people who have low vitamin D levels to begin with (low baseline vitamin D).[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplements improve day-to-day asthma symptoms or a person's lung function.[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that adults with asthma should avoid foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG).[254] There have not been enough high-quality studies performed to determine if children with asthma should avoid eating food that contains MSG.[254] Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use.[255][256] Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.[257] Manual therapies, including osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma.[258] The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.[148] Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use.[255] There is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma.[259] Prognosis The prognosis for asthma is generally good, especially for children with mild disease.[260] Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care.[261] In 2010 the death rate was 170 per million for males and 90 per million for females.[262] Rates vary between countries by 100 fold.[262] Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004 (16 million of which are in low and middle income countries).[263] Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade.[73] Airway remodeling is observed, but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes.[264] Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorates a decline in lung function.[265] Asthma in children also has negative effects on quality of life of their parents.[266]"

"If you have asthma, an asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to “asthma triggers.” Your triggers can be very different from those of someone else with asthma. Know your triggers and learn how to avoid them. Watch out for an attack when you can’t avoid the triggers. Some of the most common triggers are:

Tobacco Smoke
Tobacco smoke is unhealthy for everyone, especially people with asthma. If you have asthma and you smoke, quit smoking.

“Secondhand smoke” is smoke created by a smoker and breathed in by a second person. Secondhand smoke can trigger an asthma attack. Make your home a smoke-free zone. Encourage household members who smoke to quit. If you have asthma, people should never smoke near you, in your home, in your car, or wherever you may spend a lot of time.

Dust Mites
Dust mites are microscopic bugs that are in many homes. If you have asthma and are allergic to dust mites, they can trigger an asthma attack. To prevent attacks:

Use allergen-proof mattress and pillowcase covers to make a barrier between dust mites and yourself.
Don’t use down-filled pillows, quilts, or comforters.
Wash your bedding weekly and dry it completely.
Vacuum carpets, area rugs, and floors regularly using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter.
Keep relative humidity levels in the home low, around 30- 50%.
Outdoor Air Pollution
Outdoor air pollution can trigger an asthma attack. This pollution can come from many sources, including factories, cars, or wildfire smoke. Wildfire smoke from burning wood or other plants is made up of a mix of harmful gases and small particles. Breathing in too much of this smoke can cause an asthma attack.

Pay attention to air quality forecasts on radio, television, and the internet and check your newspaper to plan your activities for when air pollution levels will be low.

Pests (e.g., cockroaches, mice)
Cockroaches and other pests are often found where food is eaten and crumbs are left behind. To control pests in your home:

Remove as many water and food sources as you can.
Clean dishes, crumbs, and spills right away.
Store food in airtight containers.
Keep trash in a closed container.
At least every 2 to 3 days, vacuum or sweep areas that might attract cockroaches or mice.
Keep counters, sinks, tables, and floors clean and free of clutter.
Seal cracks or openings in cabinets, walls, baseboards, and around plumbing.
Use pesticide baits and traps in areas away from children and pets, following manufacturers’ instructions.
Avoid using sprays and foggers as these can cause asthma attacks.
Pets
Furry pets can trigger an asthma attack if you are allergic to them. If you think a furry pet may be causing attacks, you may want to find the pet another home. If you can’t or don’t want to find a new home for the pet, decrease your exposure by:

Keeping pets out of bedrooms,
Washing furry pets,
Using an air cleaner with HEPA filter, and
Using allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers.
People with asthma are not allergic to their pet’s fur, so trimming a pet’s fur will not help your asthma.

Mold
Breathing in mold can trigger an asthma attack whether or not you are allergic to mold. Indoor mold growth is often found in damp areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, and basements, or in areas where water damage has occurred. There are many types of mold which can be found in any climate. Get rid of mold in your home to help control your attacks.

To reduce mold exposure in your home:

Dry damp or wet items within 24 to 48 hours to prevent mold growth.
Fix water leaks, such as leaky plumbing, which let mold grow behind walls and under floors as soon as you can.
Replace absorbent materials, such as ceiling tiles and carpet, if mold is present.
Use an air conditioner or dehumidifier to maintain low indoor humidity.
Get a small tool called a hygrometer to check humidity levels and keep them as low as you can—no higher than 50%. Humidity levels change over the course of a day, so check the humidity levels more than once a day.
Scrub mold off hard surfaces with detergent and water. Dry completely.
Empty and clean refrigerator and air conditioner drip pans regularly.
Run the bathroom exhaust fan or open the window when showering.

Cleaning and Disinfection
Disinfectants can trigger an asthma attack. People with asthma should try to stay away when cleaners or disinfectants are being used and right after their use. Follow these precautions when cleaning or disinfecting places where people with asthma may spend time, such as homes, schools, or workplaces:

Avoid overuse of products. To help limit your exposure to asthma triggers, follow a schedule for cleaning and disinfecting to prevent overuse of products.
Use safer products. Any disinfectant can trigger an asthma attack, but you can take steps to reduce the chances of that happening:
Use soap and water or cleaners certified by the EPA Safer Choice programexternal icon to clean surfaces.
Clean visibly dirty surfaces before disinfecting.
Never mix disinfectant products.
Choose products for disinfecting that are less likely to cause an asthma attack, such as products with hydrogen peroxide (no stronger than 3%) or ethanol (ethyl alcohol). Ensure that products with hydrogen peroxide or ethanol do not contain other chemicals that can cause an asthma attack such as peroxyacetic acid or peracetic acid.
Avoid using bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or quaternary ammonium compounds in enclosed spaces and limit their use.
Avoid products with fragrances. The fragrances can trigger asthma attacks.
Make sure there is enough air flow (ventilation).
Open doors and windows to bring in fresh air, if it’s safe to do so.
Improve ventilation by turning on exhaust fans. Exhausting the air (blowing it outside) is the most effective way to remove disinfectant vapors.
For buildings with heating or cooling systems that have fresh (outdoor) air intakes, turn on the fresh air intake to bring in fresh air.
Using a high efficiency filter (MERV 13 or higher) with your heating and cooling system can help keep air clean by removing particles such as smoke, pollen, and traffic pollution from the air. Most air filters will not remove disinfectant vapors, though.
Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions and to replace the filter as needed. Some systems cannot accept high efficiency filters. In this case, using the highest MERV rating possible will provide the most effective air cleaning.
Use products safely and correctly.
Always follow the instructions on the product label. Do not mix chemical products together.
Wear protective gear such as gloves and goggles.
Spray or pour spray products onto a cleaning cloth or paper towel instead of spraying the product directly onto the cleaning surface (if the product label allows) to help limit exposure.
Follow EPA’s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Useexternal icon.
Avoid disturbing dust because it can be an asthma trigger.
Move away from the trigger (such as the area that was cleaned) if you experience an asthma attack, and follow your Asthma Action Plan. Call 911 for medical emergencies.
To learn more about cleaning to prevent illness in your home, including which products are effective, see Cleaning and Disinfecting your Home.

Other Triggers
Infections linked to influenza (flu), colds, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can trigger an asthma attack. Sinus infections, allergies, pollen, breathing in some chemicals, and acid reflux can also trigger attacks.

Physical exercise; some medicines; bad weather, such as thunderstorms or high humidity; breathing in cold, dry air; and some foods, food additives, and fragrances can also trigger an asthma attack.

Strong emotions can lead to very fast breathing, called hyperventilation, that can also cause an asthma attack."

"Episodic symptoms of airflow obstruction are present

Airflow obstruction or symptoms are at least partially reversible

Exclusion of alternative diagnoses

Spirometry with postbronchodilator response should be obtained as the primary test to establish the asthma diagnosis. Pulse oximetry measurement is desirable in all patients with acute asthma to exclude hypoxemia. The chest radiograph remains the initial imaging evaluation in most individuals with symptoms of asthma, but in most patients with asthma, chest radiography findings are normal or may indicate hyperinflation. Exercise spirometry is the standard method for assessing patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

"
"
Pharmacologic management includes the use of relief and control agents. Control agents include inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators (beta-agonists and anticholinergics), theophylline (Theo-24, Theochron, Uniphyl), leukotriene modifiers, anti-IgE antibodies, anti-interleukin (IL)–5 antibodies, and anti–IL-4/IL-13 antibodies. Relief medications include short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and ipratropium (Atrovent).
The pharmacologic treatment of asthma is based on stepwise therapy. Asthma medications should be added or deleted as the frequency and severity of the patient's symptoms change.

Environmental exposures and irritants can play a strong role in symptom exacerbations. The use of skin testing or in vitro testing to assess sensitivity to perennial indoor allergens is important. Once the offending allergens are identified, counsel patients on how to avoid them. Efforts should focus on the home, where specific triggers include dust mites, animals, cockroaches, mold, and pollen.
"
"Signs and symptoms of asthma include the following:

Wheezing

Coughing

Shortness of breath

Chest tightness/pain

Other nonspecific symptoms in infants or young children may be a history of recurrent bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia; a persistent cough with colds; and/or recurrent croup or chest rattling."
"Pharmacologic management includes the use of relief and control agents. Control agents include inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators (beta-agonists and anticholinergics), theophylline (Theo-24, Theochron, Uniphyl), leukotriene modifiers, anti-IgE antibodies, anti-interleukin (IL)–5 antibodies, and anti–IL-4/IL-13 antibodies. Relief medications include short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and ipratropium (Atrovent).

The pharmacologic treatment of asthma is based on stepwise therapy. Asthma medications should be added or deleted as the frequency and severity of the patient's symptoms change."
"The airways of the lungs consist of the cartilaginous bronchi, membranous bronchi, and gas-exchanging bronchi termed the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts. While the first 2 types function mostly as anatomic dead space, they also contribute to airway resistance. The smallest non-gas-exchanging airways, the terminal bronchioles, are approximately 0.5 mm in diameter; airways are considered small if they are less than 2 mm in diameter. [4]

Airway structure consists of the following:

Mucosa, which is composed of epithelial cells that are capable of specialized mucous production and a transport apparatus

Basement membrane

A smooth-muscle matrix extending to the alveolar entrances

Predominantly fibrocartilaginous or fibroelastic-supporting connective tissue."
"The pathophysiology of asthma is complex and involves airway inflammation, intermittent airflow obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The mechanism of inflammation in asthma may be acute, subacute, or chronic, and the presence of airway edema and mucus secretion also contributes to airflow obstruction and bronchial reactivity. Varying degrees of mononuclear cell and eosinophil infiltration, mucus hypersecretion, desquamation of the epithelium, smooth muscle hyperplasia, and airway remodeling are present"
"Asthma is a common chronic disease worldwide and affects approximately 26 million persons in the United States. It is the most common chronic disease in childhood, affecting an estimated 7 million children, and it is a common cause of hospitalization for children in the United States."
"For all but the most severely affected patients, the ultimate goal is to prevent symptoms, minimize morbidity from acute episodes, and prevent functional and psychological morbidity to provide a healthy (or near healthy) lifestyle appropriate to the age of child."
"Physical findings vary with the severity of the asthma and with the absence or presence of an acute episode and its severity. The severity of asthma is classified as intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent. Patients with asthma of any level of severity may have mild, moderate, or severe exacerbations."
"Cellular elements include mast cells, which are involved in the complex control of releasing histamine and other mediators. Basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages also are responsible for extensive mediator release in the early and late stages of bronchial asthma. Stretch and irritant receptors reside in the airways, as do cholinergic motor nerves, which innervate the smooth muscle and glandular units. In bronchial asthma, smooth muscle contraction in an airway is greater than that expected for its size if it were functioning normally, and this contraction varies in its distribution."
"The critical role of inflammation has been further substantiated, but evidence is emerging for considerable variability in the pattern of inflammation, thus indicating phenotypic differences that may influence treatment responses

Of the environmental factors, allergic reactions remain important. Evidence also suggests a key and expanding role for viral respiratory infections in these processes

The onset of asthma for most patients begins early in life, with the pattern of disease persistence determined by early, recognizable risk factors including atopic disease, recurrent wheezing, and a parental history of asthma

Current asthma treatment with anti-inflammatory therapy does not appear to prevent progression of the underlying disease severity"
"The mechanism of inflammation in asthma may be acute, subacute, or chronic, and the presence of airway edema and mucus secretion also contributes to airflow obstruction and bronchial reactivity. Varying degrees of mononuclear cell and eosinophil infiltration, mucus hypersecretion, desquamation of the epithelium, smooth muscle hyperplasia, and airway remodeling are present. "
"Chronic inflammation of the airways is associated with increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which leads to bronchospasm and typical symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing after exposure to allergens, environmental irritants, viruses, cold air, or exercise. In some patients with chronic asthma, airflow limitation may be only partially reversible because of airway remodeling (hypertrophy and hyperplasia of smooth muscle, angiogenesis, and subepithelial fibrosis) that occurs with chronic untreated disease."
"Airway inflammation in asthma may represent a loss of normal balance between two ""opposing"" populations of Th lymphocytes. Two types of Th lymphocytes have been characterized: Th1 and Th2. Th1 cells produce interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-α, which are critical in cellular defense mechanisms in response to infection. Th2, in contrast, generates a family of cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, and IL-13) that can mediate allergic inflammation. A study by Gauvreau et al found that IL-13 has a role in allergen-induced airway responses. "
"Airflow obstruction can be caused by a variety of changes, including acute bronchoconstriction, airway edema, chronic mucous plug formation, and airway remodeling. Acute bronchoconstriction is the consequence of immunoglobulin E-dependent mediator release upon exposure to aeroallergens and is the primary component of the early asthmatic response. Airway edema occurs 6-24 hours following an allergen challenge and is referred to as the late asthmatic response. Chronic mucous plug formation consists of an exudate of serum proteins and cell debris that may take weeks to resolve. Airway remodeling is associated with structural changes due to long-standing inflammation and may profoundly affect the extent of reversibility of airway obstruction. "
"Airway obstruction causes increased resistance to airflow and decreased expiratory flow rates. These changes lead to a decreased ability to expel air and may result in hyperinflation. The resulting overdistention helps maintain airway patency, thereby improving expiratory flow; however, it also alters pulmonary mechanics and increases the work of breathing."
"Factors that can contribute to asthma or airway hyperreactivity may include any of the following:

1. Environmental allergens (eg, house dust mites; animal allergens, especially cat and dog; cockroach allergens; and fungi)

2. Viral respiratory tract infections

3 Exercise, hyperventilation

4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease

5. Chronic sinusitis or rhinitis

6. Aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity, sulfite sensitivity

7. Use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (including ophthalmic preparations)

8. Obesity

9. Environmental pollutants, tobacco smoke

10. Occupational exposure

11. Irritants (eg, household sprays, paint fumes)

12. Various high- and low-molecular-weight compounds (eg, insects, plants, latex, gums, diisocyanates, anhydrides, wood dust, and fluxes; associated with occupational asthma)

13. Emotional factors or stress

14. Perinatal factors (prematurity and increased maternal age; maternal smoking and prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke; breastfeeding has not been definitely shown to be protective)"
"The triad of asthma, aspirin sensitivity, and nasal polyps affects 5-10% of patients with asthma. Most patients experience symptoms during the third to fourth decade. A single dose can provoke an acute asthma exacerbation, accompanied by rhinorrhea, conjunctival irritation, and flushing of the head and neck. It can also occur with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and is caused by an increase in eosinophils and cysteinyl leukotrienes after exposure. 

A study by Beasley et al demonstrated some epidemiological evidence that exposure to acetaminophen is associated with an increased risk of asthma. However, no clinical studies have directly linked asthma symptoms with acetaminophen use."
"Primary treatment is avoidance of these medications, but leukotriene antagonists have shown promise in treatment, allowing these patients to take daily aspirin for cardiac or rheumatic disease.  Aspirin desensitization has also been reported to decrease sinus symptoms, allowing daily dosing of aspirin."
"The presence of acid in the distal esophagus, mediated via vagal or other neural reflexes, can significantly increase airway resistance and airway reactivity. Patients with asthma are 3 times more likely to also have GERD. Some people with asthma have significant gastroesophageal reflux without esophageal symptoms. Gastroesophageal reflux was found to be a definite asthma-causing factor (defined by a favorable asthma response to medical antireflux therapy) in 64% of patients; clinically silent reflux was present in 24% of all patients."
"Occupational factors are associated with 10-15% of adult asthma cases. More than 300 specific occupational agents have been associated with asthma. High-risk jobs include farming, painting, janitorial work, and plastics manufacturing. Given the prevalence of work-related asthma, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) supports consideration of work-related asthma in all patients presenting with new-onset or worsening asthma. An ACCP consensus statement defines work-related asthmas as including occupational asthma (ie, asthma induced by sensitizer or irritant work exposures) and work-exacerbated asthma (ie, preexisting or concurrent asthma worsened by work factors). 

Two types of occupational asthma are recognized: immune-related and non-immune-related. Immune-mediated asthma has a latency of months to years after exposure. Non-immune-mediated asthma, or irritant-induced asthma (reactive airway dysfunction syndrome), has no latency period and may occur within 24 hours after an accidental exposure to high concentrations of respiratory irritants. Pay careful attention to the patient's occupational history. Those with a history of asthma who report worsening of symptoms during the week and improvement during the weekends should be evaluated for occupational exposure. Peak-flow monitoring during work (optimally, at least 4 times a day) for at least 2 weeks and a similar period away from work is one recommended method to establish the diagnosis."
"Evidence suggests that rhinovirus illness during infancy is a significant risk factor for the development of wheezing in preschool children and a frequent trigger of wheezing illnesses in children with asthma.  Human rhinovirus C (HRVC) is a newly identified genotype of HRV found in patients with respiratory tract infections. A study of children with acute asthma who presented to the emergency department found HRVC present in the majority of patients. The presence of HRVC was also associated with more severe asthma. 

Approximately 80-85% of childhood asthma episodes are associated with prior viral exposure. Prior childhood pneumonia due to infection by respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and/or Chlamydia species was found in more than 50% of a small sample of children aged 7-9 years who later had asthma. Treatment with antibiotics appropriate for these organisms improves the clinical signs and symptoms of asthma."
"Of patients with asthma, 50% have concurrent sinus disease. Sinusitis is the most important exacerbating factor for asthma symptoms. Either acute infectious sinus disease or chronic inflammation may contribute to worsening airway symptoms. Treatment of nasal and sinus inflammation reduces airway reactivity. Treatment of acute sinusitis requires at least 10 days of antibiotics to improve asthma symptoms."
"Exercise-induced asthma (EIA), or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), is an asthma variant defined as a condition in which exercise or vigorous physical activity triggers acute bronchoconstriction in persons with heightened airway reactivity. It is observed primarily in persons who have asthma (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic persons) but can also be found in patients with normal resting spirometry findings with atopy, allergic rhinitis, or cystic fibrosis and even in healthy persons, many of whom are elite or cold weather athletes (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in athletes). Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is often a neglected diagnosis, and the underlying asthma may be silent in as many as 50% of patients, except during exercise. "
"Exercise-induced asthma (EIA), or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), is an asthma variant defined as a condition in which exercise or vigorous physical activity triggers acute bronchoconstriction in persons with heightened airway reactivity. It is observed primarily in persons who have asthma (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic persons) but can also be found in patients with normal resting spirometry findings with atopy, allergic rhinitis, or cystic fibrosis and even in healthy persons, many of whom are elite or cold weather athletes (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in athletes). Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is often a neglected diagnosis, and the underlying asthma may be silent in as many as 50% of patients, except during exercise. 

The pathogenesis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is controversial. The disease may be mediated by water loss from the airway, heat loss from the airway, or a combination of both. The upper airway is designed to keep inspired air at 100% humidity and body temperature at 37°C (98.6°F). The nose is unable to condition the increased amount of air required for exercise, particularly in athletes who breathe through their mouths. The abnormal heat and water fluxes in the bronchial tree result in bronchoconstriction, occurring within minutes of completing exercise. Results from bronchoalveolar lavage studies have not demonstrated an increase in inflammatory mediators. These patients generally develop a refractory period, during which a second exercise challenge does not cause a significant degree of bronchoconstriction.

Factors that contribute to exercise-induced bronchoconstriction symptoms (in both persons with asthma and athletes) are: Exposure to cold or dry air, Environmental pollutants (eg, sulfur, ozone), level of bronchial hyperreactivity, Chronicity of asthma and symptomatic control, Duration and intensity of exercise, Allergen exposure in atopic individuals,Coexisting respiratory infection.
The assessment and diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is made more often in children and young adults than in older adults and is related to high levels of physical activity. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction can be observed in persons of any age based on the level of underlying airway reactivity and the level of physical exertion."
"Research on genetic mutations casts further light on the synergistic nature of multiple mutations in the pathophysiology of asthma. Polymorphisms in the gene that encodes platelet-activating factor hydrolase, an intrinsic neutralizing agent of platelet-activating factor in most humans, may play a role in susceptibility to asthma and asthma severity. 

Evidence suggests that the prevalence of asthma is reduced in association with certain infections (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, measles, or hepatitis A); rural living; exposure to other children (eg, presence of older siblings and early enrollment in childcare); and less frequent use of antibiotics. Furthermore, the absence of these lifestyle events is associated with the persistence of a Th2 cytokine pattern. Under these conditions, the genetic background of the child, with a cytokine imbalance toward Th2, sets the stage to promote the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody to key environmental antigens (eg, dust mites, cockroaches, Alternaria, and possibly cats). Therefore, a gene-by-environment interaction occurs in which the susceptible host is exposed to environmental factors that are capable of generating IgE, and sensitization occurs.

A reciprocal interaction is apparent between the 2 subpopulations, in which Th1 cytokines can inhibit Th2 generation and vice versa. Allergic inflammation may be the result of an excessive expression of Th2 cytokines. Alternatively, studies suggest the possibility that the loss of normal immune balance arises from a cytokine dysregulation in which Th1 activity in asthma is diminished. 

In addition, some studies highlight the importance of genotypes in children's susceptibility to asthma and response to specific antiasthma medications"
"A study by Cottrell et al explored the relationship between asthma, obesity, and abnormal lipid and glucose metabolism. The study found that community-based data linked asthma, body mass, and metabolic variables in children. Specifically, these findings described a statistically significant association between asthma and abnormal lipid and glucose metabolism beyond body mass association. Evidence is accumulating that individuals with a high body mass index have worse asthma control and sustained weight loss improves asthma control. 

Accelerated weight gain in early infancy is associated with increased risks of asthma symptoms according to one study of preschool children."
"Asthma affects 5-10% of the population or an estimated 23.4 million persons, including 7 million children. The overall prevalence rate of exercise-induced bronchospasm is 3-10% of the general population if persons who do not have asthma or allergy are excluded, but the rate increases to 12-15% of the general population if patients with underlying asthma are included. Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide. Annually, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 15 million disability-adjusted life-years are lost and 250,000 asthma deaths are reported worldwide. "
"In the United States, asthma prevalence, especially morbidity and mortality, is higher in blacks than in whites. Although genetic factors are of major importance in determining a predisposition to the development of asthma, environmental factors play a greater role than racial factors in asthma onset. A national concern is that some of the increased morbidity is due to differences in asthma treatment afforded certain minority groups. Larger asthma-associated lung function deficits are reported in Hispanics, especially females."
"Asthma is common in industrialized nations such as Canada, England, Australia, Germany, and New Zealand, where much of the asthma data have been collected. The prevalence rate of severe asthma in industrialized countries ranges from 2-10%. Trends suggest an increase in both the prevalence and morbidity of asthma, especially in children younger than 6 years. Factors that have been implicated include urbanization, air pollution, passive smoking, and change in exposure to environmental allergens."
"
Asthma predominantly occurs in boys in childhood, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1 until puberty, when the male-to-female ratio becomes 1:1. Asthma prevalence is greater in females after puberty, and the majority of adult-onset cases diagnosed in persons older than 40 years occur in females. Boys are more likely than girls to experience a decrease in symptoms by late adolescence."
Asthma prevalence is increased in very young persons and very old persons because of airway responsiveness and lower levels of lung function. Two thirds of all asthma cases are diagnosed before the patient is aged 18 years. Approximately half of all children diagnosed with asthma have a decrease or disappearance of symptoms by early adulthood.
"International asthma mortality is reported as high as 0.86 deaths per 100,000 persons in some countries. US asthma mortality rates in 2009 were reported at 1 death per 100,000 persons. Mortality is primarily related to lung function, with an 8-fold increase in patients in the lowest quartile, but mortality has also been linked with asthma management failure, especially in young persons. Other factors that impact mortality include age older than 40 years, cigarette smoking more than 20 pack-years, blood eosinophilia, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40-69% predicted, and greater reversibility."
"The estimate of lost work and school time from asthma is approximately 100 million days of restricted activity. Approximately 500,000 annual hospitalizations (40.6% in individuals aged 18 y or younger) are due to asthma. Each year, an estimated 1.7 million people (47.8% of them aged 18 years or younger) require treatment in an emergency department. For 2010, the annual expenditures for health and lost productivity due to asthma was projected to be $20.7 billion."
"Nearly one half of children diagnosed with asthma will have a decrease in symptoms and require less treatment by late adolescence or early adulthood. In a study of 900 children with asthma, 6% required no treatment after 1 year, and 39% only required intermittent treatment."
"Patients with poorly controlled asthma develop long-term changes over time (i.e., with airway remodeling). This can lead to chronic symptoms and a significant irreversible component to their disease. Many patients who develop asthma at an older age also tend to have chronic symptoms."
"The need for patient education about asthma and the establishment of a partnership between patient and clinician in the management of the disease was emphasized by EPR-3.

The key points of education include the following:

1. Patient education should be integrated into every aspect of asthma care

2. All members of the healthcare team, including nurses, pharmacists, and respiratory therapists, should provide education.

3. Clinicians should teach patients asthma self-management based on basic asthma facts, self-monitoring techniques, the role of medications, inhaler use, and environmental control measures. 

4.Treatment goals should be developed for the patient and family.

5. A written, individualized, daily self-management plan should be developed.

6. Several well-validated asthma action plans are now available and are key in the management of asthma and should therefore be reviewed: ACT (Asthma Control Test), ATAQ (Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire), and ACQ (Asthma Control Questionnaire). "
"School-based asthma education programs improved knowledge of asthma, self-efficacy, and self-management behaviors in children aged 4-17 years, according to a systematic literature review by Coffman et al, but the programs had less effect on quality of life, days of symptoms, nights with symptoms, and school absences"
The 2009 Veterans Administration/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) clinical practice guideline for management of asthma in children and adults concurs with EPR-3 in recommending self-management education for both the patient and caregiver as part of the treatment program.
"A detailed assessment of the medical history should address the following:

Whether symptoms are attributable to asthma

Whether findings support the likelihood of asthma (eg, family history)

Asthma severity

Identification of possible precipitating factors

Family history may be pertinent for asthma, allergy, sinusitis, rhinitis, eczema, and nasal polyps. The social history may include home characteristics, smoking, workplace or school characteristics, educational level, employment, social support, factors that may contribute to nonadherence of asthma medications, and illicit drug use.

The patient’s exacerbation history is important with respect to the following:

Usual prodromal signs or symptoms

Rapidity of onset

Associated illnesses

Number in the last year

Need for emergency department visits, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, intubations

Missed days from work or school or activity limitation

The patient’s perception of his or her asthma is important regarding knowledge of asthma and treatment, use of medications, coping mechanisms, family support, and economic resources."
"Wheezing, a musical, high-pitched, whistling sound produced by airflow turbulence, is one of the most common symptoms. In the mildest form, wheezing is only end expiratory. As severity increases, the wheeze lasts throughout expiration. In a more severe asthmatic episode, wheezing is also present during inspiration. During a most severe episode, wheezing may be absent because of the severe limitation of airflow associated with airway narrowing and respiratory muscle fatigue.

Asthma can occur without wheezing when obstruction involves predominantly the small airways. Thus, wheezing is not necessary for the diagnosis of asthma. Furthermore, wheezing can be associated with other causes of airway obstruction, such as cystic fibrosis and heart failure. Patients with vocal cord dysfunction, now referred to as inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO), have a predominantly inspiratory monophonic wheeze (different from the polyphonic wheeze in asthma), which is heard best over the laryngeal area in the neck. Patients with excessive dynamic airway collapse (EDAC), bronchomalacia, or tracheomalacia also have an expiratory monophonic wheeze heard over the large airways. In exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, wheezing may be present after exercise, and in nocturnal asthma, wheezing is present during the night."
"Cough may be the only symptom of asthma, especially in cases of exercise-induced or nocturnal asthma. Usually, the cough is nonproductive and nonparoxysmal. Children with nocturnal asthma tend to cough after midnight and during the early hours of morning. Chest tightness or a history of tightness or pain in the chest may be present with or without other symptoms of asthma, especially in exercise-induced or nocturnal asthma."
"Other nonspecific symptoms in infants or young children may be a history of recurrent bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia; a persistent cough with colds; and/or recurrent croup or chest rattling. Most children with chronic or recurrent bronchitis have asthma. Asthma is also the most common underlying diagnosis in children with recurrent pneumonia; older children may have a history of chest tightness and/or recurrent chest congestion."
"In patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, the clinical history findings are typical of asthma but are associated only with exercise. Typical symptoms include cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest pain or tightness. Some individuals also may report sore throat or GI upset. Initially, airway dilation is noted during exercise. If exercise continues beyond approximately 10 minutes, bronchoconstriction supervenes, resulting in asthma symptoms. If the exercise period is shorter, symptoms may develop up to 5-10 minutes after completion of exercise. Higher intensity levels of exercise result in a more intense attack, with running producing more symptoms than walking."
"Patients may note asthma symptoms are related to seasonal changes or the ambient temperature and humidity in the environment in which a patient exercises. Other triggers may be pollutants (eg, sulfur, nitrous oxide, ozone) or upper respiratory tract infections. Cold, dry air generally provokes more obstruction than warm, humid air. Consequently, many athletes have good exercise tolerance in sports such as swimming. A prospective longitudinal study in Britain found that swimming was associated with increased lung function and lower risk of asthma-related symptoms, especially among children with respiratory conditions. 

Athletes who are more physically fit may not notice the typical asthma symptoms and may report only a reduced or more limited level of endurance. Several modifiers in the history should prompt an evaluation for causes other than exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. While patients may report typical obstructive symptoms, a history of a choking sensation with exercise, inspiratory wheezing, or stridor should prompt an evaluation for evidence of vocal cord dysfunction."
"Acute episodes can be mild, moderately severe, severe, or characterized by imminent respiratory arrest."
"During a mild episode, patients may be breathless after physical activity such as walking; they can talk in sentences and lie down; and they may be agitated. Patients with mild acute asthma are able to lie flat. In a mild episode, the respiratory rate is increased, and accessory muscles of respiration are not used. The heart rate is less than 100 bpm, and pulsus paradoxus (an exaggerated fall in systolic blood pressure during inspiration) is not present. Auscultation of the chest reveals moderate wheezing, which is often end expiratory. Rapid forced expiration may elicit wheezing that is otherwise inaudible, and oxyhemoglobin saturation with room air is greater than 95%."
"In a moderately severe episode, the respiratory rate also is increased. Typically, accessory muscles of respiration are used. In children, also look for supraclavicular and intercostal retractions and nasal flaring, as well as abdominal breathing. The heart rate is 100-120 bpm. Loud expiratory wheezing can be heard, and pulsus paradoxus may be present (10-20 mm Hg). Oxyhemoglobin saturation with room air is 91-95%. Patients experiencing a moderately severe episode are breathless while talking, and infants have feeding difficulties and a softer, shorter cry. In more severe cases, the patient assumes a sitting position."
"In a severe episode, patients are breathless during rest, are not interested in eating, sit upright, talk in words rather than sentences, and are usually agitated. In a severe episode, the respiratory rate is often greater than 30 per minute. Accessory muscles of respiration are usually used, and suprasternal retractions are commonly present. The heart rate is more than 120 bpm. Loud biphasic (expiratory and inspiratory) wheezing can be heard, and pulsus paradoxus is often present (20-40 mm Hg). Oxyhemoglobin saturation with room air is less than 91%. As the severity increases, the patient increasingly assumes a hunched-over sitting position with the hands supporting the torso, termed the tripod position.
"
"When children are in imminent respiratory arrest, in addition to the aforementioned symptoms, they are drowsy and confused, but adolescents may not have these symptoms until they are in frank respiratory failure. In status asthmaticus with imminent respiratory arrest, paradoxical thoracoabdominal movement occurs. Wheezing may be absent (associated with most severe airway obstruction), and severe hypoxemia may manifest as bradycardia. Pulsus paradoxus noted earlier may be absent; this finding suggests respiratory muscle fatigue.

As the episode becomes more severe, profuse diaphoresis occurs, with the diaphoresis presenting concomitantly with a rise in PCO2 and hypoventilation. In the most severe form of acute asthma, patients may struggle for air, act confused and agitated, and pull off their oxygen, stating, ""I can’t breathe."" These are signs of life-threatening hypoxia. With advanced hypercarbia, bradypnea, somnolence, and profuse diaphoresis may be present; almost no breath sounds may be heard; and the patient is willing to lie recumbent."
"Signs of atopy or allergic rhinitis, such as conjunctival congestion and inflammation, ocular shiners, a transverse crease on the nose due to constant rubbing associated with allergic rhinitis, and pale violaceous nasal mucosa due to allergic rhinitis, may be present in the absence of an acute episode, such as during an outpatient visit between acute episodes. Turbinates may be erythematous or boggy. Polyps may be present.

Skin examination may reveal atopic dermatitis, eczema, or other manifestations of allergic skin conditions. Clubbing of the fingers is not a feature of asthma and indicates a need for more extensive evaluation and workup to exclude other conditions, such as cystic fibrosis."
"A large percentage of patients with asthma experience nocturnal symptoms once or twice a month. Some patients only experience symptoms at night and have normal pulmonary function in the daytime. This is due, in part, to the exaggerated response to the normal circadian variation in airflow. Children with nocturnal asthma tend to cough after midnight and during the early hours of morning."
Bronchoconstriction is highest between the hours of 4:00 am and 6:00 am (the highest morbidity and mortality from asthma is observed during this time). These patients may have a more significant decrease in cortisol levels or increased vagal tone at night. Studies also show an increase in inflammation compared with controls and with patients with daytime asthma.
"Asthma severity is defined as ""the intensity of the disease process"" prior to initiating therapy and helps in determining the initiation of therapy in a patient who is not on any controller medications. [1]

The severity of asthma is classified as the following:

Intermittent,

Mild persistent

Moderate persistent

Severe persistent"
"Patients with asthma of any level of severity may have mild, moderate, or severe exacerbations. Some patients with intermittent asthma have severe and life-threatening exacerbations separated by episodes with almost normal lung function and minimal symptoms; however, they are likely to have other evidence of increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR; exercise or challenge testing) due to ongoing inflammation.

An important point to remember is that the presence of one severe feature is sufficient to diagnose severe persistent asthma. Also, the characteristics in this classification system are general and may overlap because asthma severity varies widely. A patient’s classification may change over time."
"Vocal cord dysfunction may exist alone or with asthma, it is caused by paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords during inspiration, and may disappear with panting, speech, or laughing. Patients with chronic symptoms suggestive of asthma, normal spirometry, poor response to asthma medications, and frequent evaluations should be evaluated for vocal cord dysfunction.  Usually, the diagnosis can be made using direct laryngoscopy, but only during symptomatic periods or after exercise. The presence of flattening of the inspiratory limb of the flow-volume loop may also suggest vocal cord dysfunction, but this is only seen in 28% of patients at baseline. "
"A variety of airway tumors are reported to manifest with symptoms similar to those of asthma. These tumors include endobronchial carcinoid and mucoepidermoid tumors, as shown in the images below. In one case, a 14-year-old boy with hyperlucency in the left lung was ultimately found to have a bronchial carcinoid in the left mainstem bronchus. Other tracheal lesions can include bronchocentric granulomatosis, subglottic stenosis, subglottic web, tracheal hamartoma, bronchogenic cysts, leiomyoma, and tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica. All these types of tracheal lesions have been reported with symptoms similar to asthma."
"Foreign body aspiration may cause not only localized wheezing but also generalized wheezing. Wheezing occurs in toddlers as well as in adults. As described in one patient, foreign body aspiration may necessitate bronchoscopic retrieval before the patient even recalls the inciting event, and as many as 25% of patients may never recall the event. [49] Furthermore, aspirated foreign bodies may be radiolucent and therefore not be visible on a chest radiograph.  Radiography may show unilateral hyperinflation (from air trapping), infiltrate (from occlusion of a bronchus), or may be normal."
"Pulmonary migraine consists of combined recurrent asthma; cough with thick mucoid sputum; lower back pain radiating to the shoulder; subtotal or total atelectasis of a segment or lobe; and, occasionally, nausea with vomiting. [50] The symptoms are often accompanied closely in time by focal headache. Spastic narrowing of the bronchi is postulated—along with retained mucous secretions, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and thickened bronchial walls—to cause expiratory collapse of selected airways. Cerebral and abdominal vascular migraine episodes are believed to accompany pulmonary migraine."
"Congestive heart failure causes engorged pulmonary vessels and interstitial pulmonary edema, which reduce lung compliance and contribute to the sensation of dyspnea and wheezing. Cardiac asthma is characterized by wheezing secondary to bronchospasm in congestive heart failure, and it is related to paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and nocturnal coughing."
"Diffuse panbronchiolitis is prevalent in Japan and the Far East, and it may mimic bronchial asthma with wheezing, coughing, dyspnea on exertion, and sinusitis. [52] High-resolution CT (HRCT) findings include centrilobular nodules and linear markings that usually are more profuse than the multifocal bronchiolar impaction sometimes observed with asthma."
"Aortic arch anomalies may occur later in adulthood. In one case, the anomalies, which simulated exercise-induced asthma, were noticed first in a young woman only after a vigorous exercise program. [53] On testing, the flow-volume display of this patient suggested an intrathoracic obstruction. The patient had a right aortic arch with ligamentum arteriosum that extended anterior to the trachea. This condition caused constriction when increased pulmonary blood flow, oxygen demand, and tracheal airflow and decreased intratracheal pressure from downstream turbulence distal to the tracheal ring occurred with exercise; combined, these factors produced wheezing and dyspnea."
"Sinus disease, especially in children, is associated with bronchial asthma and wheezing. Although the association is not strong in patients with CT evidence of mild sinus mucosal thickening, a scoring system developed by Newman et al showed that extensive sinus disease was correlated with a substantially higher extent of wheezing than that in patients with only mild thickening. Of 104 adults, 39% had extensive disease, as visualized on CT scans, which was correlated with asthma and peripheral eosinophilia. "
"Cough, recurrent bronchitis, pneumonia, wheezing, and asthma are associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GER). [55, 56] The incidence of GER in patients with asthma ranges from 38% in patients with only asthma symptoms to 48% in patients with recurrent pneumonia. Scintigraphic studies performed after technetium-99m sulfur-colloid ingestion have shown radionuclide activity in the lungs the next day, but no causal relationship between reflux and asthma has been established. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that increased pulmonary resistance occurs with symptoms of reflux during acid provocation testing; as some have suggested, the changes may be sufficiently significant to produce clinically evident bronchoconstriction. "
"Other extrinsic conditions, such as lymphadenopathy from sarcoidosis or Hodgkin lymphoma of the upper mediastinum, can contribute to asthma. In addition, aspirin or NSAID hypersensitivity and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome may be mistaken for asthma. Misdiagnoses as refractory bronchial asthma has resulted in inappropriate long-term treatment with corticosteroids."
A significant history of smoking greater than 20-pack years should make the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) a stronger consideration than asthma.
"Consideration for alternative diagnoses should be given in all patients, and in particular in those older than 30 years and younger than 2 years with new symptoms suggestive of asthma. An absence of airway obstruction on initial spirometry findings should prompt consideration for alternative diagnoses and additional testing."




























"Medical care includes treatment of acute asthmatic episodes and control of chronic symptoms, including nocturnal and exercise-induced asthmatic symptoms. Pharmacologic management includes the use of control agents such as inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators (beta-agonists and anticholinergics), theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, and more recent strategies such as the use of anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies (omalizumab), anti–IL5 antibodies, and anti–IL4/IL13 antibodies in selected patients. Relief medications include short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and ipratropium."
"For all but the most severely affected patients, the ultimate goal is to prevent symptoms, minimize morbidity from acute episodes, and prevent functional and psychological morbidity to provide a healthy (or near healthy) lifestyle appropriate to the age of child."
"A stepwise (step-up if necessary and step-down when possible) approach to asthma management continues to be used in the current guidelines and is now divided into 3 groups based on age (0-4 y, 5-11 y, 12 y and older). [1]"
"For all patients, quick-relief medications include rapid-acting beta2 agonists as needed for symptoms. The intensity of treatment depends on the severity of symptoms. If rapid-acting beta2 agonists are used more than 2 days a week for symptom relief (not including use of rapid-acting beta2 agonists for prevention of exercise-induced symptoms), stepping up on treatment may need be considered."
A Cochrane review found that inhaled corticosteroids are superior to anti-leukotrienes when used as monotherapy in adults and children with persistent asthma. The superiority of inhaled corticosteroids is most pronounced in asthma patients with moderate airway obstruction. [72] The 2019 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines identify inhaled corticosteroids as the preferred controller medication of choice for children and adults.
"In general, patients should be assessed every 1-6 months for asthma control. At every visit, adherence, environmental control, and comorbid conditions should be checked. If the patient has good control of their asthma for at least 3 months, treatment can be stepped down; however, the patient should be reassessed in 2-4 weeks to make sure that control is maintained with the new treatment."
"A study by Bruzzese et al assessed the Asthma Self-Management for Adolescents (ASMA) approach, which is a school-based intervention for adolescents and medical providers. [73] The study found that ASMA helped improve self-management and reduced morbidity and urgent health care use in low-income, urban, minority adolescents."
"Environmental exposures and irritants can play a strong role in symptom exacerbations. Therefore, in patients who have persistent asthma, the use of skin testing or in vitro testing to assess sensitivity to perennial indoor allergens is important. Once the offending allergens are identified, counsel patients on avoidance from these exposures. In addition, education to avoid tobacco smoke (both first-hand and second-hand exposure) is important for patients with asthma."
"Allergen avoidance takes different forms, depending on the specific allergen size and characteristic. Improvement in symptoms after avoidance of the allergen should result rather rapidly, though the allergen itself (eg, cat dander) may linger in the environment for months after primary removal of the source. A multifaceted approach is necessary, as individual interventions are rarely successful by themselves."
"Efforts should focus on the home, where 30-60% of time is spent. Patients should clean and dust their homes regularly. [75] If a patient cannot avoid vacuuming, he or she should use a face mask or a double-bagged vacuum with a high-efficiency particulate air filter. If possible, consideration can be given to moving to a higher floor in the house (less dust and mold) or different neighborhood (fewer cockroaches). Active smoking and exposure to passive smoke must be avoided. Room air ionizers have not been proven to be effective for people with chronic asthma, and the generation of ozone by these machines may be harmful to some. Specific factors related to the home include dust mites, animals, cockroaches, mold, and pollen (see Indoor Aeroallergens for more details)."
"Air pollution caused by traffic may increase the risk of asthma and wheezing, especially in individuals with EPHX1 gene and enzyme activity. [76] This can be mediated through airway oxidative stress generation."
"In the case of dust mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and farina, size 30 μm), the primary allergen is an intestinal enzyme on fecal particles. The allergen settles on fabric because of its relatively large size; therefore, air filtration is not very effective. Measures to avoid dust mites include using impervious covers (eg, on mattresses, pillows, comforters, the most important intervention), washing other bedding in hot water (130°F [54.4°C] most effective), removing rugs from the bedroom, limiting upholstered furniture, reducing the number of window blinds, and putting clothing away in closets and drawers. Minimize the number of soft toys, and wash them weekly or periodically put them in the freezer. Decrease room humidity (< 50%)."
"Most trials to date have been small and of poor methodologic quality. Therefore, clinicians cannot easily offer definitive recommendations on the role of house dust mite avoidance measures in the management of perennial allergic rhinitis that is sensitive to house dust mites. Conclusions from this analysis suggest that acaricides and extensive bedroom-based environmental control programs may help reduce rhinitis symptoms. If such measures are considered appropriate, they should be the interventions of choice. However, analysis also indicated that isolated use of bedding that is impermeable to house dust mites is not likely to be effective in reducing rhinitis symptoms caused by dust mites. [77]"
"Because of the small size (1-20 μm) of dander, saliva, urine, or serum proteins of cats and other animals, these allergens are predominantly airborne indoor allergens. Avoidance involves removing animals from the home (or at least from the bedroom), using dense filtering material over heating and cooling duct vents, and washing cats and dogs as often as twice weekly. The antigens may remain in a home for 6 months or more after cats are removed from the home, and cat antigen may be found in homes and offices where cats were never present, highlighting the importance of frequent cleaning."
"Twenty percent of homes without visible infestation still produce sensitizing levels of cockroach allergen (size 30 μm). Successful allergen elimination measures are difficult, especially in poor living conditions. To control cockroaches, exterminate and use poison baits and traps, keep food out of the bedroom, and never leave food out in the open."
"For indoor molds (size 1-150 μm), avoidance includes keeping areas dry (eg, remove carpets from wet floors), removing old wallpaper, cleaning with bleach products, and storing firewood outdoors."
"Pollen (size 1-150 μm) avoidance is difficult or impossible, but efforts to reduce exposure include closing windows and doors, using air conditioning and high-efficiency particulate air filters in the car and home, staying inside during the midday and afternoon when pollen counts are highest, wearing glasses or sunglasses, and wearing a face mask over the nose and mouth when mowing the lawn. In addition, consider increasing medications preseason and vacationing in a different ecosystem during pollen season."
"The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report recommends that immunotherapy be considered if the following criteria are fulfilled:
A relationship is clear between symptoms and exposure to an unavoidable allergen to which the patient is sensitive.
Symptoms occur all year or during a major portion of the year.
Symptoms are difficult to control with pharmacologic management because the medication is ineffective, multiple medications are required, or the patient is not accepting of medication."
"Immunotherapy decreased asthma symptoms and the need for medication in a 2003 meta-analysis of 75 randomized controlled trials by Abramson et al. [80] Another study showed improved peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and decreased use of medications in a highly selected group of children, but only for the first year of therapy."
"Allergen immunotherapy should be considered if specific allergens have a proven relationship to symptoms and a vaccine to the allergen is available; the individual is sensitized (ie, positive skin test or RAST findings); the allergen cannot be avoided and is present year-round (eg, industrial); or symptoms are poorly controlled with medical therapy. As discussed above, this treatment is especially useful if asthma is associated with allergic rhinitis."
"Referral to an allergist is required, and the patient must commit to a course of 3-5 years of therapy (although a trial of several months can be considered)."
"Precautions include serious adverse reactions (occurring in 1 per 30-500 people, usually within 30 min). The estimated crude annual death rate is 0.7 deaths per million population. Monitoring and resuscitation personnel and equipment are required. Also, allergen immunotherapy should be avoided if the patient is taking beta blockers or is having an asthma exacerbation (ie, PEFR < 70% of patient’s personal best) or has moderate or worse fixed obstruction. A major risk factor for immunotherapy-related fatalities includes uncontrolled asthma; therefore, appropriate caution should be exercised."
"Dosing of allergen extracts is in bioequivalent allergy units (BAU), weight per volume (w/v), or protein nitrogen units (PNU), but ""major allergen content"" may be a more standardized and reliable method of dosing and characterizing allergen extracts; however, not all allergens have been standardized. Extracts with modifications that decrease allergenicity (adverse reactions) without reducing immunogenicity (effectiveness) are under investigation."
"Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has been shown to improve allergic rhinitis symptoms, including in pediatric patients and allergic asthma. While adverse reactions do occur, SLIT is safe enough for home administration. Based on limited data, sublingual therapy, at least in the short term, may be about half as effective as traditional subcutaneous injection. While SLIT is widely used in European, South American, and Asian countries, as of early 2016, it is not FDA approved and remains off-label use in the United States."
Omalizumab is indicated for adults and children aged 6 years or older with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma who have a positive skin test result or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids. Patients should have IgE levels between 30 and 700 IU and should not weigh more than 150 kg.
"Therapy has been shown to decrease free IgE antibody levels by 99% and cell receptor sites for IgE antibody by 97%. This decrease, in turn, is associated with reduced histamine production (90%), early-phase bronchospasm (40%), and late-phase bronchospasm (70%), as well as a decrease in the number, migration, and activity of eosinophils. Levels drop quickly and remain low for at least a month. This therapy is also effective for allergic rhinitis."
"Adverse effects are rare and include upper respiratory infection symptoms, headache, urticaria (2%) without anaphylaxis, and anaphylaxis (0.1% in studies and 0.2% in postmarketing surveillance). Transient thrombocytopenia has also been noted but not in humans. Antibodies are formed against the anti-IgE antibody, but these do not appear to cause immune complex deposition or other significant problems. To date, decreased IgE levels have not been shown to inhibit one’s ability to fight infection (including parasites). Registration trials raised a question of increased risk of malignancy, but this has not been seen in the postmarketing data."
"Omalizumab is given by subcutaneous injection every 2-4 weeks based on initial serum IgE level and body weight. Patients are usually treated for a trial period lasting at least 12 weeks. Costs may be $6,110 to $36,600 annually, so omalizumab is a second-line therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe persistent allergic asthma that is not fully controlled on standard therapy. [81]"
"A study by Busse et al found that omalizumab further improved asthma control, nearly eliminated seasonal exacerbation peaks, and reduced the need for other medications to control asthma when added to a regimen of guidelines-based therapy in inner-city children, adolescents, and young adults. [82]

A study by Hanania et al found that omalizumab provided additional benefit in patients with severe allergic asthma that is insufficiently controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists. [83] However, the results of the study were limited by early patient discontinuation (20.8%) and were limited because the study was not powered to detect rare safety events or treatment effect in the corticosteroid grou"
"Mepolizumab is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody specific for interleukin 5 (IL-5). Mepolizumab binds to IL-5 and therefore stops IL-5 from binding to its receptor on the surface of eosinophils. Inhibiting IL-5 binding to eosinophils reduces blood, tissue, and sputum eosinophil levels. It is indicated for add-on maintenance treatment of patients with severe asthma aged 12 years or older and with an eosinophilic phenotype."
Reslizumab is an IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-5. It was approved by the FDA in March 2016 and is indicated for add-on maintenance treatment of patients with severe asthma aged 18 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype. It is administered as an intravenous infusion every 4 weeks. 
"Benralizumab is an IL-5 receptor, alpha-directed cytolytic mAb (IgG1, kappa) approved by the FDA in November 2017. The IL-5 receptor is expressed on the surface of eosinophils and basophils. Benralizumab reduces eosinophils and basophils through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). It is indicated for add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma in patients aged 12 years or older who have an eosinophilic phenotype. Patients with oral corticosteroid–dependent severe asthma were administered dupilumab add-on therapy or matched placebo to current maintenance therapy every 2 weeks for 24 weeks or matched placebo. Corticosteroid doses were gradually decreased from week 4 to week 20 and then maintained for 4 weeks. "
Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a novel intervention for asthma in which controlled thermal energy is delivered to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopy procedures.
"A group of patients (AIR2 Trial Study Group) with severe asthma who remained symptomatic despite treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2 agonists underwent BT and showed superior improvement from baseline in their score on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (BT, 1.35±1.10; sham, 1.16±1.23). Changes in AQLQ of 0.5 or greater were seen in 79% of BT and in 64% of sham subjects. Although the hospitalization rate was 6% higher among BT subjects during the treatment period (up to 6 wk after BT), in the posttreatment period (6-52 wk after BT), the BT group experienced fewer severe exacerbations, emergency department visits, and days missed from work/school compared with the sham group. [93]The long-term safety and effectiveness of bronchial thermoplasty in 162 patients with severe persistent asthma from the Asthma Intervention Research 2 (AIR2) trial, which showed a 32% reduction in severe asthma exacerbations, an 84% reduction in respiratory symptom-related emergency department visits, a 73% reduction in hospitalizations for respiratory symptoms, and a 66% reduction in time lost from work/school/other daily activities because of asthma symptoms. [95, 96]"
"A group of patients (AIR2 Trial Study Group) with severe asthma who remained symptomatic despite treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2 agonists underwent BT and showed superior improvement from baseline in their score on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (BT, 1.35±1.10; sham, 1.16±1.23)."
"Albuterol is administered 2.5-5 mg every 20 minutes for 3 doses, then 2.5-10 mg every 1-4 hours as needed; dilution of 2.5 mg in 3-4 mL of saline or use of premixed nebules is standard. Oxygen or compressed air delivery of the inhaled beta agonists should be at a rate of 6-8 L/min. For children, use 0.15 mg/kg (minimum dose 2.5 mg) every 20 minutes for 3 doses, then 0.15-0.3 mg/kg up to 10 mg every 1-4 hours as needed."
"Side effects may include tremor and a slight tendency toward tachycardia. However, many patients who present with acute asthma and tachycardia actually decrease their heart rate with inhaled beta-agonist therapy. In addition, inhaled beta agonists decrease potassium by an average of 0.4 mEq/L."
"Patients who respond poorly or not at all to an inhaled beta-agonist regimen may respond to parenteral beta2 agonists, such as 0.25 mg terbutaline or 0.3 mg of 1:1000 concentration of epinephrine administered subcutaneously. This treatment should be reserved for patients who are seriously ill and not responding to serial treatments with inhaled beta-agonist/anticholinergic therapy and other more established therapies."
"Ipratropium 0.5 mg has had variable benefit in controlled trials, demonstrating most consistent efficacy in children and smokers with comorbid COPD. The current NAEPP guidelines (2007) recommend its use in severe exacerbations only. [1] Ipratropium should be given in combination with albuterol every 20 minutes for 3 doses, then as needed. The addition of ipratropium has not been shown to provide further benefit once the patient is hospitalized."
"Continuous nebulization may be superior to the MDI/holding chamber method in a patient with severe exacerbations (eg, PEF < 200 L/min). The dose of albuterol is 10-15 mg in 70 mL of isotonic saline. For children, this method is reserved for severe asthma at an albuterol dose of 0.5 mg/kg/h. Based on meta-analyses, there is no advantage of intravenous albuterol over inhaled albuterol, even in severe asthma. However, the role of parenteral beta agonists in addition to inhaled beta-agonist treatments is uncertain."
"A study by Dhuper et al found no evidence that nebulizers were more effective than MDI/spacer beta agonist delivery in emergency management of acute asthma in an inner-city adult population. [98] Thus, because they are more cost effective, MDI/spacer may be a better alternative to nebulizer delivery for some individuals."
"In children, long-term use of high-dose steroids (systemic or inhaled) may lead to adverse effects that include growth failure. However, long-term use of inhaled steroids (budesonide) was shown to have no sustained adverse effect on growth in children, according to the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP). [101, 102]

In preschool children with asthma, 2 years of inhaled corticosteroid therapy did not change the asthma symptoms or lung function during a third, treatment-free year. This suggests that no disease-modifying effect of inhaled corticosteroids is present after the treatment is discontinued. [103]"
"Complications of long-term corticosteroid use may include osteoporosis, immunosuppression, cataracts, myopathy, weight gain, addisonian crisis, thinning of skin, easy bruising, avascular necrosis, diabetes, and psychiatric disorders."
"Heliox is a helium-oxygen (80:20 or 70:30) mixture that may provide dramatic benefit for ED patients with severe exacerbations. Helium is about 10% as dense as room air and, consequently, travels more easily down narrowed passages. This property makes heliox of particular value to patients at risk of intubation—by quickly decreasing the work of breathing and, when the gas mixture is used to drive the nebulizer, by better delivery of the inhaled bronchodilator."
"Briefly, heliox-driven nebulizer treatments should have the gas set at a rate of 8-10 L/min and with double the usual amount of albuterol. These adjustments result in the delivery of the appropriate amount of albuterol to the patient but with particles being delivered in the heliox mixture instead of oxygen or room air. When patients need supplemental oxygen, one can deliver it via nasal prong. Of course, as the supplemental oxygen is increased, the benefits of using heliox decrease. Oxygen requirements should determine the ideal mix. The role of heliox in acute asthma remains under investigation."
"Despite the best efforts of the ED, some patients require endotracheal intubation. Approximately 5-10% of all hospital admissions for asthma are to an intensive care unit—for further care of already intubated patients or for close supervision of patients at very high risk of intubation."
"Indications for hospitalization are based on findings from the repeat assessment of a patient after the patient receives 3 doses of an inhaled bronchodilator. The decision whether to admit is based on the following:

Duration and severity of asthma symptoms

Severity of airflow obstruction

Course and severity of prior exacerbations

Medication use and access to medications

Adequacy of support and home conditions

Presence of psychiatric illness"
The role of permissive hypercapnia goes beyond the scope of this article but is a ventilator strategy used in the ICU management of some patients with severe asthma exacerbations.
"Status asthmaticus, or an acute severe asthmatic episode that is resistant to appropriate outpatient therapy, is a medical emergency that requires aggressive hospital management. This may include admission to an ICU for the treatment of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and dehydration and possibly for assisted ventilation because of respiratory failure."
"Asthma complicates 4-8% of pregnancies. Mild and well-controlled moderate asthma can be associated with excellent maternal and perinatal pregnancy outcomes. Severe and poorly controlled asthma may be associated with increased prematurity and other perinatal complications, to include maternal morbidity and mortality. Optimal management of asthma during pregnancy includes objective monitoring of lung function, avoiding or controlling asthma triggers, patient education, and individualized pharmacologic therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred medication for all levels of persistent asthma during pregnancy. For pregnant women with asthma, it is safer to be treated with asthma medications than to have asthma symptoms and exacerbations. The ultimate goal of asthma therapy is to maintain adequate oxygenation of the fetus by prevention of hypoxic episodes in the mother."
"The presence of acid in the distal esophagus, mediated via vagal or other neural reflexes, can significantly increase airway resistance and airway reactivity. Patients with asthma are 3 times more likely to also have GERD. [14] Aggressive antireflux therapy may improve asthma symptoms and pulmonary function in selected patients. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors, antacids, or H2 blockers may improve asthma symptoms or unexplained chronic cough.

The treatment of asthma with agents such as theophylline may lower esophageal sphincter tone and induce GERD symptoms. Some people with asthma have significant gastroesophageal reflux without esophageal symptoms."
"Of patients with asthma, 50% have concurrent sinus disease. Sinusitis is the most important exacerbating factor for asthma symptoms. Either acute infectious sinus disease or chronic inflammation may contribute to worsening airway symptoms. Treatment of nasal and sinus inflammation reduces airway reactivity. Treatment of acute sinusitis requires at least 10 days of antibiotics to improve asthma symptoms. [19]"
"Nocturnal asthma is a significant clinical problem that should be addressed aggressively. Peak-flow meters should be used to allow objective evaluation of symptoms and interventions. Sleep apnea, symptomatic GERD, and sinusitis should be controlled when present. Medications should be appropriately timed, and consideration should be given to the use of a long-acting inhaled or oral beta2 agonist and a leukotriene modifier with inhaled corticosteroids. A once-daily sustained-release theophylline preparation and changing the timing of oral corticosteroids to midafternoon can be also be used."
"For all patients with asthma, monitoring should be performed on a continual basis based on the following parameters, which helps in the overall management of the disease:

Regarding monitoring of asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be taught to recognize inadequate asthma control, and providers should assess control at each visit.

To monitor pulmonary function, regularly perform spirometry and peak-flow monitoring.

For quality of life and functional status, inquire about missed work or school days, reduction in activities, sleep disturbances, or change in caregiver activities.

To monitor the history of asthma exacerbations, determine whether patients are monitoring themselves to detect asthma exacerbations and if these exacerbations are self-treated or treated by health care providers.

Regarding monitoring pharmacotherapy, ensure compliance with medications and usage of short-acting beta agonists.

Monitor patient-provider communication and patient satisfaction"
"If evidence of airflow obstruction (< 80% of baseline values) is present, a brief course of corticosteroids is recommended. Patients who have received oral corticosteroids for an asthma exacerbation in the past 6 months should receive systemic corticosteroids (100 mg hydrocortisone IV q 8 h) in the perioperative period."
"Activity is generally limited by patients' ability to exercise and their response to medications. No specific limitations are recommended for patients with asthma, although they should avoid exposure to agents that may exacerbate their disease."
"A significant number of patients with asthma also have exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and baseline control of their disease should be adequate to prevent exertional symptoms. The ability of patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction to exercise is based on the level of exertion, degree of fitness, and environment in which they exercise.

Many patients have fewer problems when exercising indoors or in a warm, humid environment than they do outdoors or in a cold, dry environment"
"Information from prospective cohort studies and population-based studies in the past several years suggests an association between asthma and obesity. Patients with an elevated body mass index have an increased risk for developing asthma. A prospective cohort study of almost 86,000 adult women in the Nurses' Health Study II observed for 5 years showed a linear relationship between body mass index and the risk of developing asthma. [10]"
"No special diets are generally indicated. Food allergy as a trigger for asthma is uncommon. Unless compelling evidence for a specific allergy exists, milk products do not have to be avoided. Avoidance of foods is recommended after a double-blind food challenge that yields positive results. Sulfites have been implicated in some severe asthma exacerbations and should be avoided in sensitive individuals."
"Refer any patient with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma that is difficult to control to a pulmonologist or allergist to ensure proper stepwise asthma management, or refer for further evaluation to help rule out other diagnoses such as VCD/ILO. Also, abnormalities found on chest radiography screening should prompt referral to a specialist for further evaluation."
"All patients with asthma should be advised to avoid exposure to allergens to which they are sensitive, especially in the setting of occupational asthma. Other factors may include the following:

Environmental tobacco smoke

Exertion during high levels of air pollution

Use of beta blockers

Avoidance of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs if the patient is sensitive

Avoidance of sulfites or other food items/additives to which the patient may be sensitive

Occupational exposures"


"Laboratory assessments and studies are not routinely indicated for the diagnosis of asthma, but they may be used to exclude other diagnoses. Eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE levels may help guide therapy in some cases. Arterial blood gases and pulse oximetry are valuable for assessing severity of exacerbations and following response to treatment."
"Blood eosinophilia greater than 4% or 300-400/μL supports the diagnosis of asthma, but an absence of this finding is not exclusionary. Eosinophil counts greater than 8% may be observed in patients with concomitant atopic dermatitis. This finding should prompt an evaluation for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, or eosinophilic pneumonia.

In assessing asthma control, the British Thoracic Society recommends using sputum eosinophilia determinations to guide therapy. An improvement in asthma control, a decrease in hospitalizations, and a decrease in exacerbations were noted in those patients in whom sputum-guided therapy was used. [57] A controlled prospective study has shown that adjusting inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment to control sputum eosinophilia—as opposed to controlling symptoms, short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) use, nocturnal awakenings, and pulmonary function—significantly reduced both the rate of asthma exacerbations and the cumulative dose of inhaled corticosteroids. [58] In 2015, mepolizumab (anti-IL-5 antibody) was FDA approved for the treatment of severe asthmatics with an eosinophilic phenotype who have a baseline eosinophil count of 150 cells/μL or an eosinophil count of 300 cells/μL within the past 12 months."

"Total serum immunoglobulin E levels greater than 100 IU are frequently observed in patients experiencing allergic reactions, but this finding is not specific for asthma and may be observed in patients with other conditions (eg, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome). A normal total serum immunoglobulin E level does not exclude the diagnosis of asthma. Elevated serum IgE levels are required for chronic asthma patients to be treated with omalizumab (Xolair)."
"Arterial blood gas (ABG) measurement provides important information in acute asthma. This test may reveal dangerous levels of hypoxemia or hypercarbia secondary to hypoventilation and, hence, respiratory acidosis. However, the typical finding in the early stages of an acute episode is respiratory alkalosis. Because of the accuracy and utility of pulse oximetry, only patients whose oxygenation is not restored to over 90% with oxygen therapy require an ABG. The clinical picture usually obviates ABGs for most ED patients with acute asthma.

Venous levels of PCO2 have been tested as a substitute for arterial measurements, and a venous PCO2 greater than 45 mm may serve as a screening test but cannot substitute for the ABG evaluation of respiratory function.

Hypercarbia is of concern in that it reflects inadequate ventilation and may indicate the need for mechanical ventilation if the PCO2 is elevated as a result of patient exhaustion; however, the decision to proceed with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is a clinical assessment."

"Periostin is a novel biomarker that is currently under investigation as a diagnostic and treatment adjunct. [59] Evidence suggests that periostin is a marker of Th2/eosinophilic inflammation and airway remodeling that occurs with asthma. While there are no therapies currently approved based on periostin testing, several investigational medications are being studied with periostin as a predictor of medication effect. In one phase IIb study, periostin was a good predictor of response to lebrikizumab in patients not controlled on inhaled corticosteroids, with an increase in FEV1 of 8.2% for high periostin levels compared with placebo with an increase in FEV1 of 1.6% for low periostin levels. Currently, there is no clinical role for routine periostin testing."
"Pulse oximetry measurement is desirable in all patients with acute asthma to exclude hypoxemia. The hypoxemia of uncomplicated acute asthma is readily reversible by oxygen administration. Oxygenation decreases 4-10 mm Hg with beta-agonist inhalant therapy due to increases in V/Q mismatch. Therefore, all patients with acute asthma should have oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry, or they simply should be placed on oxygen therapy.

In children, pulse oximetry is often used to grade severity of acute asthma. Oxygen saturation of 97% or above constitutes mild asthma, 92-97% constitutes moderate asthma, and less than 92% signifies severe asthma. Although an isolated pulse oximetry reading at triage is not predictive in most cases (with the notable exception of severe attacks that usually are self-evident on visual inspection), serial monitoring of pulse oximetry status can provide more subtle evidence for or against the need for hospital admission."

"The chest radiograph remains the initial imaging evaluation in most individuals with symptoms of asthma. The value of chest radiography is in revealing complications or alternative causes of wheezing and the minor importance of wheezing in the diagnosis of asthma and its exacerbations. Chest radiography usually is more useful in the initial diagnosis of bronchial asthma than in the detection of exacerbations, although it is valuable in excluding complications such as pneumonia and asthma mimics, even during exacerbations.

In most patients with asthma, chest radiography findings are normal or may indicate hyperinflation. Findings may help rule out other pulmonary diseases such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or sarcoidosis, which can manifest with symptoms of reactive airway disease. Chest radiography should be considered in all patients being evaluated for asthma to exclude other diagnoses.

Because pneumonia is one of the most common complications of asthma, chest radiography is indicated in patients with fever to rule out pneumonia. With new-onset asthma and eosinophilia, a radiograph may be useful in identifying prominent streaky infiltrates persisting less than 1 month, indicating Loeffler pneumonia. The infiltrates of Loeffler pneumonia are peripheral with central sparing of the lung fields. These findings have been described as the radiographic negative of pulmonary edema.

Patients with pleuritic chest pain or those with an acute asthmatic episode that responds poorly to therapy, require a chest film to exclude pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, particularly if subcutaneous emphysema is present"
"The chest radiograph remains the initial imaging evaluation in most individuals with symptoms of asthma. The value of chest radiography is in revealing complications or alternative causes of wheezing and the minor importance of wheezing in the diagnosis of asthma and its exacerbations. Chest radiography usually is more useful in the initial diagnosis of bronchial asthma than in the detection of exacerbations, although it is valuable in excluding complications such as pneumonia and asthma mimics, even during exacerbations.

In most patients with asthma, chest radiography findings are normal or may indicate hyperinflation. Findings may help rule out other pulmonary diseases such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or sarcoidosis, which can manifest with symptoms of reactive airway disease. Chest radiography should be considered in all patients being evaluated for asthma to exclude other diagnoses.

Because pneumonia is one of the most common complications of asthma, chest radiography is indicated in patients with fever to rule out pneumonia. With new-onset asthma and eosinophilia, a radiograph may be useful in identifying prominent streaky infiltrates persisting less than 1 month, indicating Loeffler pneumonia. The infiltrates of Loeffler pneumonia are peripheral with central sparing of the lung fields. These findings have been described as the radiographic negative of pulmonary edema.

"High-resolution CT (HRCT) is a second-line examination. It is useful in patients with chronic or recurring symptoms and in those with possible complications such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bronchiectasis. [60] In the last decade, the role of CT in the imaging of airway disease increased after the development of lung HRCT. The technical progress of thin-section acquisition, high-spatial-frequency data reconstruction (ie, bone algorithm technique), and targeted reconstruction has allowed the visualization of finer details on HRCT scans; these details include airtrapping, measurable bronchial wall thickening, atelectasis, centrilobular nodules due to mucous plugging, and acinar nodules due to low-grade inflammatory changes. [61]

HRCT findings in bronchial asthma include the following:

Bronchial wall thickening

Bronchial dilatation

Cylindrical and varicose bronchiectasis

Reduced airway luminal area

Mucoid impaction of the bronchi

Centrilobular opacities, or bronchiolar impaction

Linear opacities

Airtrapping, as demonstrated or exacerbated with expiration

Mosaic lung attenuation, or focal and regional areas of decreased perfusions"

"Patients with asthma who are severely symptomatic should undergo ECG monitoring, as with any seriously ill patient. Sinus tachycardia and ECG evidence of right heart strain are common in patients with acute asthma. The use of beta2 -agonist therapy will cause a paradoxical decrease in heart rate as pulmonary function improves and symptoms are relieved. Supraventricular tachycardia raises the consideration of theophylline toxicity. Arrhythmias, other than supraventricular tachycardia, are rare."
"Aside from cardiovascular applications, MRI of the thorax is used primarily as a problem-solving modality in the workup of patients with lung, mediastinal, or pleural lesions. MRI is a useful alternative to CT pulmonary angiography in evaluating possible pulmonary embolic disease in patients in whom iodinated contrast agent cannot be administered and when the avoidance of ionizing radiation is preferred. In bronchial asthma, the most promising work appears to involve the use of special paramagnetic gases, which amplify the low signal-to-noise ratio of conventional spin-echo and gradient-echo techniques by several thousand times. The use of such gases offsets the disadvantages of the large magnetic susceptibility states with consequent shortened T2 signals induced by the air-alveolar interfaces."
"Nuclear medicine technology has been used in the study of aerosol and particulate distribution in the airways. Technetium-99m DTPA radioaerosol lung scintigraphy is a classic technique that shows the extent of major airway distribution, peripheral distribution (depending on particle size), and absorption in the oronasal air passages. Technetium-99m radioaerosol has been used to show improved peripheral lung distribution of corticosteroid both in normal persons and in persons treating their asthma using dry-powder inhalers as opposed to pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) with a spacer device. Ventilation scanning with Technetium-99m DTPA has also been used as an indicator of ventilation defects in asthmatic children."
"Allergy skin testing is a useful adjunct in individuals with atopy. Results help guide indoor allergen mitigation or help diagnose allergic rhinitis symptoms. The allergens that most commonly cause asthma are aeroallergens such as house dust mites, animal danders, pollens, and mold spores. Two methods are available to test for allergic sensitivity to specific allergens in the environment: allergy skin tests and blood radioallergosorbent tests (RASTs). Allergy immunotherapy may be beneficial in controlling allergic rhinitis and asthma symptoms for some patients."
"Spirometry assessments should be obtained as the primary test to establish the asthma diagnosis. Spirometry should be performed prior to initiating treatment in order to establish the presence and determine the severity of baseline airway obstruction. [62] Optimally, the initial spirometry should also include measurements before and after inhalation of a short-acting bronchodilator in all patients in whom the diagnosis of asthma is considered. Spirometry measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), the maximal amount of air expired from the point of maximal inhalation, and the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). A reduced ratio of FEV1 to FVC, when compared with predicted values, demonstrates the presence of airway obstruction. Reversibility is demonstrated by an increase of 12% and 200 mL after the administration of a short-acting bronchodilator.

As a preliminary assessment for exercise-induced asthma (EIA), or exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB), perform spirometry in all patients with exercise symptoms to determine if any baseline abnormalities (ie, the presence of obstructive or restrictive indices) are present. The assessment and diagnosis of asthma cannot be based on spirometry findings alone because many other diseases are associated with obstructive spirometry indices.

Single-breath counting (SBC) is a novel technique for measuring pulmonary function in children. SBC is the measurement of how far an individual can count using a normal speaking voice after one maximal effort inhalation. The count is in cadence to a metronome that is set at 2 beats per second. A study by Ali et al determined that SBC correlates well with standard measures of pulmonary function. [63] However, further studies are needed to establish values and to evaluate the use in an ED population of patients with acute asthma exacerbation."

"Methacholine/histamine challenge
Bronchoprovocation testing with either methacholine or histamine is useful when spirometry findings are normal or near normal, especially in patients with intermittent or exercise-induced asthma symptoms. Bronchoprovocation testing helps determine if airway hyperreactivity is present, and a negative test result usually excludes the diagnosis of asthma. Methacholine is a direct stimulant that acts directly on acetylcholine receptors on smooth muscle, causing contraction and airway narrowing. Methacholine has been reported to have a high sensitivity to identify airway hyperresponsiveness and a negative test is often used to exclude asthma.

Trained individuals should perform this asthma testing in an appropriate facility and in accordance with the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society published in 1999. [64] Methacholine is administered in incremental doses up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/mL, and a 20% decrease in FEV1, up to the 4 mg/mL level, is considered a positive test result for the presence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The presence of airflow obstruction with an FEV1 less than 65-70% at baseline is generally an indication to avoid performing the test.

Eucapnic hyperventilation
Eucapnic hyperventilation with either cold or dry air is an alternative method of bronchoprovocation testing. It has been used to evaluate patients for exercise-induced asthma and has been shown to produce results similar to those of methacholine-challenge asthma testing.

Exercise testing
Exercise spirometry is the standard method for assessing patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstricition. Testing involves 6-10 minutes of strenuous exertion at 85-90% of predicted maximal heart rate and measurement of postexercise spirometry for 15-30 minutes. The defined cutoff for a positive test result is a 15% decrease in FEV1 after exercise.

Exercise testing may be accomplished in 3 different ways, using cycle ergometry, a standard treadmill test, or free running exercise. This method of testing is limited because laboratory conditions may not subject the patient to the usual conditions that trigger exercise-induced bronchoconstriction symptoms, and results have a lower sensitivity for asthma than other methods.

Allergen-inhalation challenge
Allergen-inhalation challenges can be performed in selected patients but are generally not needed or recommended. This test requires an available allergen solution and specialized centers able to handle potentially significant reactions. A negative test finding may allow continued exposure to an allergen (eg, family pet); a positive test finding can dramatically indicate that the patient should avoid a particular allergen. This test is often needed to help diagnose occupational asthma

Mannitol
Mannitol is a provocation test that uses indirect stimuli, causing smooth muscle contraction by release of endogenous mediators, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and histamine. Mannitol is equivalent for the diagnosis of asthma compared with methacholine but is not currently available for use in the United States. [65]"

"Peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement is common in the ED because it is inexpensive and portable. Serial measurements document response to therapy and, along with other parameters, are helpful in determining whether to admit the patient to the hospital or discharge from the ED. A limitation of PEF is that it is dependent on effort by the patient. FEV1 is also effort dependent but less so than PEF. FEV1 is not often used in the ED except in research settings.

PEF in the ED can be compared with asymptomatic (baseline) PEF, if known. Unfortunately, patients often do not know their asymptomatic PEF. Moreover, the reference group for the ideal PEF percent predicted (based on age, sex, height) may not be accurate for the patient population seen in many inner-city EDs, since most equations are based on white populations."
"Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is gaining attention for the evaluation of obstructive lung disease, including asthma. IOS uses a speaker to produce pressure oscillations within the airway, resulting in measurement of pressure changes and flows with calculation of resistance, reactance, and resonance. Different frequencies are used to assess large and small airways, which is helpful to determine where the primary obstruction is occurring. For example, a patient with asthma would demonstrate increased resistance at 5 Hz (R5, distal airways) with a normal resistance at 20 Hz (R20, central airways). The primary benefit of IOS is the effort-independent nature of the test, such that small children and frail adults can easily perform the test. Therefore, in patients unable to perform spirometry or with normal spirometry but symptoms suggestive of asthma, IOS could be used to determine if there is increased airway resistance or a bronchodilator response compatible with bronchial hyperreactivity. IOS is also very quickly obtained, but provides no information on lung volumes or oxygen diffusion capacity. Currently, routine use of IOS is limited by a lack of universally accepted reference values across all patient populations."
"Exhaled nitric oxide analysis has been shown to predict airway inflammation and asthma control; however, it is technically more complex and not routinely used in the monitoring of patients with asthma.

A prospective, controlled study has shown that when inhaled corticosteroid asthma treatment was adjusted to control the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, as opposed to controlling the standard indices of asthma, the cumulative dose of ICS was reduced, with no worsening of the frequency of asthma exacerbations. [66]"
"Sinus CT scanning may be useful to help exclude acute or chronic sinusitis as a contributing factor. In patients with chronic sinus symptoms, CT scanning of the sinuses can also help rule out chronic sinus disease. Conventional wisdom regarding the sinus radiographic evaluation of chronic coughing and asthma suggests that a workup for chronic coughing should be performed first, as outlined in a Finnish study of hospital admissions for acute asthma. Admission chest radiographs showed abnormalities in 50% of the patients and resulted in treatment changes in 5%. The numbers were more remarkable when a paranasal sinus series was obtained in unselected patients who presented primarily because of asthma.

A sinus abnormality of any kind was found in 85% of patients; maxillary sinus abnormalities occurred alone in 63%. In 29% of patients with a sinus abnormality, treatment was immediately altered. All abnormalities were identified on the Waters view alone, which is 6 times more useful than chest radiography in directing the treatment of acute asthma. [67, 68]"
"A 24-hour pH probe can be used to help diagnose gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) if a patient’s condition is refractory to asthma therapy. Empirical medical therapy is often tried without performing diagnostic tests for GERD, especially if a patient has symptoms of GERD. In cases of GERD, a prolonged trial of therapy may be necessary. The median time to improvement of GERD-induced cough has been reported as 3 months. [69] A 2012 study of severe asthmatics demonstrated that GERD was a significant component in these patients. [70"
"Asthma is an inflammatory disease characterized by the recruitment of inflammatory cells, vascular congestion, increased vascular permeability, increased tissue volume, and the presence of an exudate. Eosinophilic infiltration, a universal finding, is considered a major marker of the inflammatory activity of the disease.

Histologic evaluations of the airways in a typical patient reveal infiltration with inflammatory cells, narrowing of airway lumina, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial denudation, and mucus plugs. Additionally, a patient with severe asthma may have a markedly thickened basement membrane and airway remodeling in the form of subepithelial fibrosis and smooth muscle hypertrophy or hyperplasia."
"The 2007 NAEPP guidelines [1] and the 2009 VA/DoD asthma management guidelines [43] use the severity of asthma classification below, with features of asthma severity divided into three charts to reflect classification in different age groups (0-4 y, 5-11 y, and 12 y and older). Classification includes (1) intermittent asthma, (2) mild persistent asthma, (3) moderate persistent asthma, (4) and severe persistent asthma.

Intermittent asthma is characterized as follows:

Symptoms of cough, wheezing, chest tightness, or difficulty breathing less than twice a week
Flare-ups are brief, but intensity may vary
Nighttime symptoms less than twice a month
No symptoms between flare-ups
Lung function test FEV 1 is 80% or more above normal values
Peak flow has less than 20% variability am-to-am or am-to-pm, day-to-day
Mild persistent asthma is characterized as follows:

Symptoms of cough, wheezing, chest tightness, or difficulty breathing 3-6 times a week
Flare-ups may affect activity level
Nighttime symptoms 3-4 times a month
Lung function test FEV 1 is 80% or more above normal values
Peak flow has less than 20-30% variability
Moderate persistent asthma is characterized as follows:

Symptoms of cough, wheezing, chest tightness, or difficulty breathing daily
Flare-ups may affect activity level
Nighttime symptoms 5 or more times a month
Lung function test FEV 1 is above 60% but below 80% of normal values
Peak flow has more than 30% variability
Severe persistent asthma is characterized as follows:

Symptoms of cough, wheezing, chest tightness, or difficulty breathing that are continual
Frequent nighttime symptoms
Lung function test FEV 1 is 60% or less of normal values
Peak flow has more than 30% variability
In contrast, the 2019 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines categorize asthma severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Severity is assessed retrospectively from the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations, as follows [106] :

Mild asthma: Well controlled with as-needed reliever medication alone or with low-intensity controller treatment such as low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), leukotriene receptor antagonists, or chromones
Moderate asthma: Well controlled with low-dose ICS/long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA)
Severe asthma: Requires high-dose ICS/LABA to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled, or asthma that remains uncontrolled despite this treatment"
"The 2013 joint European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) guidelines on evaluation and treatment of severe asthma reserves the definition of severe asthma for patients with refractory asthma and those in whom response to treatment of comorbidities is incomplete. [109]

The 2019 GINA guidelines stress the importance of distinguishing between severe asthma and uncontrolled asthma, as the latter is a much more common reason for persistent symptoms and exacerbations, and it may be more easily improved. The most common problems that need to be excluded before a diagnosis of severe asthma can be made are the following [106] :

Poor inhaler technique
Poor medication adherence
Incorrect diagnosis of asthma, with symptoms due to alternative conditions such as upper airway dysfunction, cardiac failure, or lack of fitness
Comorbidities and complicating conditions such as rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea
Ongoing exposure to sensitizing or irritant agents in the home or work environment."
"The goals for successful management of asthma outlined in the 2007 NHLBI publication ""Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention"" (see the images below) include the following [1] :

Achieve and maintain control of asthma symptoms
Maintain normal activity levels, including exercise
Maintain pulmonary function as close to normal as possible
Prevent asthma exacerbations
Avoid adverse effects from asthma medications
Prevent asthma mortality

The pharmacologic treatment of asthma is based on stepwise therapy. Asthma medications should be added or deleted as the frequency and severity of the patient's symptoms change. The 2007 NAEPP guidelines offer the recommendations below. [1]

Step 1 for intermittent asthma is as follows:

Controller medication not indicated
Reliever medication is a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) as needed for symptoms
Step 2 for mild persistent asthma is as follows:

Preferred controller medication is a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid
Alternatives include cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), [110] or theophylline
Step 3 for moderate persistent asthma is as follows:

Preferred controller medication is either a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) (combination medication preferred choice to improve compliance) [111] or an inhaled medium-dose corticosteroid
Alternatives include an low-dose ICS plus either a LTRA or theophylline
Step 4 for moderate-to-severe persistent asthma is as follows:

Preferred controller medication is an inhaled medium-dose corticosteroid plus a LABA (combination therapy)
Alternatives include an inhaled medium-dose corticosteroid plus either an LTRA or theophylline
Step 5 for severe persistent asthma is as follows:

Preferred controller medication is an inhaled high-dose corticosteroid plus LABA
Step 6 for severe persistent asthma is as follows:

Preferred controller medication is an inhaled high-dose corticosteroid plus LABA plus oral corticosteroid
The 2019 GINA guidelines include the stepwise recommendations below for medication and symptom control. [106]

The preferred reliever medication is specified as low-dose ICS-formoterol, which is an off-label use. Other reliever options include as-needed SABA. See the following stepwise approach:

Step 1: As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol (off-label); other options are low dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken
Step 2: Daily low-dose ICS, or as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol (off-label); other options are leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken
Step 3: Low-dose ICS/LABA; other options include medium-dose ICS or low-dose ICS + LTRA
Step 4: Medium-dose ICS-LABA; other options are high-dose ICS, add-on tiotropium, or add-on LTRA
Step 5: High-dose ICS-LABA; refer for phenotypic assessment with or without add-on therapy (eg, tiotropium, anti-IgE, anti-IL5/5R, and IL4R; other options are to add low-dose OCS, but consider adverse effects
The change in GINA guidelines from SABA to ICS-formoterol as the recommended as-needed inhaler was based on the SYGMA I/II trials published in 2018. SYGMA I showed that as-needed budesonide-formoterol was superior to as-needed terbutaline but was inferior to budesonide maintenance therapy. Exacerbation rates were similar for budesonide-containing strategies, both of which were lower than terbutaline. SYGMA II concluded that as needed budesonide-formoterol was noninferior to budesonide maintenance therapy for the rate of severe exacerbations but was inferior for controlling asthma symptoms. Both trials showed a reduction in overall ICS exposure with as-needed budesonide/formoterol."
"In 2013, the American Thoracic Society released clinical guidelines for the management of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), which included the following recommendations [112] :

Administration of an inhaled SABA before exercise (strong recommendation); the SABA is typically administered 15 minutes before exercise
A controller agent is added whenever SABA therapy is used daily or more frequently
Interval or combination warm-up exercise before planned exercise (strong recommendation)
Recommend against daily use of an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist as single therapy (strong recommendation)
For patients who continue to have symptoms despite using an inhaled SABA before exercise or who require an inhaled SABA daily or more frequently: (1) Daily ICS (strong recommendation), (2) Daily administration of an LTRA (strong recommendation), (3) Administration of a mast cell‒stabilizing agent before exercise (strong recommendation), and (4) Inhaled anticholinergic agent before exercise (weak recommendation)
For patients with EIB and allergies who continue to have symptoms despite using an inhaled SABA before exercise or who require an inhaled SABA daily or more frequently consider administration of an antihistamine (weak recommendation)
For exercise in cold weather, routine use of a device (eg, mask) that warms and humidifies the air during exercise (weak recommendation)"
"Asthma medications are generally divided into two categories:

Quick relief (also called reliever medications)

Long-term control (also called controller medications)

Quick relief
Quick relief medications are used to relieve acute asthma exacerbations and to prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) symptoms. These medications include short-acting beta agonists (SABAs), anticholinergics (used only for severe exacerbations), and systemic corticosteroids, which speed recovery from acute exacerbations.

Long-term control
Long-term control medications include inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), [99, 100] long-acting beta agonists (LABAs), long-acting anticholinergics, combination inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists, methylxanthines, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. Inhaled corticosteroids are considered the primary drug of choice for control of chronic asthma, but unfortunately the response to this treatment is characterized by wide variability among patients. A study by Tantisira et al showed the glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 gene (GLCCI1) to be the cause of this decrease in response. [113]"

A study by Tantisira et al showed the glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 gene (GLCCI1) to be the cause of this decrease in response. [113]

In a study by Peters et al, the use of the anticholinergic agent tiotropium in 210 asthmatic patients resulted in a superior outcome compared with a doubling of the dose of an inhaled glucocorticoid, as assessed by measuring the morning peak expiratory flow and other secondary outcomes. The addition of tiotropium in this study was also shown to be noninferior to the addition of salmeterol. [114]

Kerstjens et al evaluated 912 patients already taking an ICS/LABA combination who were randomized to 48 weeks of tiotropium versus placebo in two replicate, randomized, controlled trials. The patients had a mean baseline FEV1 of 62% of the predicted value. The use of tiotropium compared to placebo increased the time to first exacerbation (282 versus 226 days) and resulted in a higher peak change in FEV1 from baseline of 86 ± 34 mL (Trial 1) and 154 ± 32 mL (Trial 2) for those patients taking tiotropium. [115]

In a cross-sectional population-level comparison study of asthmatics from 1997-1998 and 2004-2005, researchers evaluated controller-to-total asthma medication ratio (greater than 0.5) with asthma exacerbation rates (dispensing of systemic corticosteroid or emergency department visit/hospitalization for asthma). They were able to demonstrate an increased use of asthma controllers based on a 16% increase in controller-to-total asthma medication ratio. However, there was no change in annual asthma exacerbation rates (0.27/year to 0.23/year) despite this improvement in controller use. [116]

Two systematic reviews indicate that the regular use of ICSs for the treatment of pediatric asthma may suppress linear growth in the first year of treatment, but lower ICS doses may minimize such effects. [1, 2, 117] The investigators of both reviews also noted that head-to-head comparison trials are needed to assess the effects of different ICSs, ICS doses, inhalation devices, and patient ages on growth suppression over time."
"Anticholinergic Agents
The long-acting anticholinergic agent, tiotropium, may be considered for long-term maintenance therapy, but not for acute treatment of asthma exacerbations.

Tiotropium is a long-acting antimuscarinic agent, often referred to as an anticholinergic. It inhibits M3-receptors at smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation. It is indicated for long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 6 years or older.

Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA)
Ipratropium is chemically related to atropine. It has antisecretory properties and, when applied locally, inhibits secretions from serous and seromucous glands lining the nasal mucosa. It is approved for COPD, but off-label use for acute exacerbations of asthma in addition to beta2-agonist therapy has been described in the literature. It is a short-acting anticholinergic agent with an onset of 15 minutes."
"Long-acting beta2 agonists
Long-acting bronchodilators are not used for the treatment of acute bronchospasm. In combination with corticosteroids, they are used for the preventive treatment of asthma symptoms.

Salmeterol (Serevent Diskus)
Salmeterol can relieve bronchospasm by relaxing the smooth muscles of the bronchioles in conditions associated with bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, or bronchiectasis. The effect also may facilitate expectoration. Adverse effects are more likely when salmeterol is administered at high doses or more frequent doses than recommended. It is to be used with inhaled corticosteroids and not as monotherapy.

Formoterol (Perforomist)
Formoterol is a long acting beta2 agonist. By relaxing the smooth muscles of bronchioles in conditions associated with bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, or bronchiectasis, formoterol can relieve bronchospasms. The effects may also facilitate expectoration. It has been shown to improve symptoms and morning peak flows. Adverse effects are more likely when formoterol is administered at high doses or more frequent doses than recommended. To be used with inhaled corticosteroids and not as monothrapy."
"Beta2-Agonist/Corticosteroid Combinations
These combinations may decrease asthma exacerbations when inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists and corticosteroids have failed.

Budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort)
Formoterol relieves bronchospasm by relaxing the smooth muscles of the bronchioles in conditions associated with asthma. Budesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid that alters the level of inflammation in airways by inhibiting multiple types of inflammatory cells and decreasing the production of cytokines and other mediators involved in the asthmatic response.

Mometasone and formoterol (Dulera)
Combination corticosteroid and long-acting selective beta-2 agonist (LABA) metered-dose inhaler. Mometasone elicits local anti-inflammatory effects to respiratory tract with minimal systemic absorption. Formoterol elicits bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. Indicated for prevention and maintenance of asthma symptoms in patients inadequately controlled with other asthma controller medications (eg, low- to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with 2 maintenance therapies, including a LABA. Available in 3 strengths; each actuation delivers mometasone/formoterol 50 mcg/5 mcg, 100 mcg/5 mcg, or 200 mcg/5 mcg.

Salmeterol/fluticasone inhaled (Advair Diskus, Advair HFA, AirDuo RespiClick)
Fluticasone inhibits bronchoconstriction mechanisms, produces direct smooth muscle relaxation, and may decrease the number and activity of inflammatory cells, in turn decreasing airway hyperresponsiveness. It also has vasoconstrictive activity. Salmeterol relaxes the smooth muscles of the bronchioles in conditions associated with bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, or bronchiectasis, and can relieve bronchospasms. Its effects may also facilitate expectoration. Adverse effects are more likely to occur when the agent is administered at high or more frequent doses than recommended.

Vilanterol/fluticasone furoate inhaled (Breo Ellipta)
Indicated for once-daily treatment of asthma for adults not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication (eg, inhaled corticosteroid), or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta agonist (LABA). Use prescribed strength (25 mcg/100 mcg or 25 mcg/200 mcg per actuation) once daily via oral inhalation. Fluticasone furoate is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Vilanterol is a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) that stimulates intracellular adenyl cyclase (catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells."
"Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist
Knowledge that leukotrienes cause bronchospasm, increased vascular permeability, mucosal edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration leads to the concept of modifying their action by using pharmacologic agents.

Zafirlukast (Accolate)
Zafirlukast is a selective competitive inhibitor of LTD4 and LTE4 receptors.

Montelukast (Singulair)
Montelukast is the last agent introduced in its class. The advantages are that it is chewable, it has a once-a-day dosing, and it has no significant adverse effects."
"Monoclonal Antibodies, Anti-asthmatics
Monoclonal antibody effects vary depending on their receptor target. Omalizumab binds to IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils. It reduces the release of these mediators that promote an allergic response. Mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab inhibit IL-5 binding to eosinophils and result in reduced blood, tissue, and sputum eosinophil levels. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 receptor alpha, and thereby blocks IL-4 and IL-13 signaling.

Omalizumab (Xolair)
Omalizumab is a recombinant, DNA-derived, humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to human IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils. It reduces mediator release, which promotes an allergic response. It is indicated for moderate-to-severe persistent asthma in patients aged 6 years or older who react to perennial allergens in whom symptoms are not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids.

Mepolizumab (Nucala)
Mepolizumab is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody specific for IL-5. Mepolizumab binds to IL-5 and therefore stops IL-5 from binding to its receptor on the surface of eosinophils. It is indicated for add-on maintenance treatment of patients with severe asthma aged 12 years or older and with an eosinophilic phenotype.

Reslizumab (Cinqair)
Reslizumab is an IL-5 antagonist monoclonal antibody (IgG kappa). It is indicated for add-on maintenance treatment of patients with severe asthma aged 18 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype.

Benralizumab (Fasenra)
Benralizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1/kappa-class) selective for the IL-5 alpha subunit of basophils and eosinophils. It is indicated for add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma in patients aged 12 years or older who have an eosinophilic phenotype.

Dupilumab (Dupixent)
Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 receptor alpha, and thereby blocks IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. This, in turn, reduces the cytokine-induced inflammatory response. It is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment for moderate-to-severe asthma in patients aged 12 years or older with eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid–dependent asthma."
