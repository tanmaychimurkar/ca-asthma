Because of my last 4-5 chest infections this year and severe allergies/allergy infections I\\'ve had to go on a bunch of courses of steroids which I\\'m also allergic to turns out lol. Well i gained 30lbs over the time. I\\'m already deeply upset about it. I\\'m already working on it. I\\'ve lost 40lbs before so I know I can. \\n\\nAnyway I did all the pft tests. Coughed my brains out. Saw spots. Got dizzy and light headed. The tech was great though. Get to the doctor after an eternity. He\\'s incredibly rude, disrespectful, and arrogant. And he just says sleep apnea over and over and over and makes a comment on my weight without me getting any chance to explain it. He doesn\\'t listen to my chest. \"Exam\" must be a joke to him. He doesn\\'t do anything, but condescendingly tell me when I\\'m ready to get better come treat my sleep apnea.\\n\\n I\\'ve never been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I know it\\'s possible, but how would that explain the rest of my symptoms? And how would that explain me having next to no sleep apnea symptoms?\\n\\nHe didn\\'t ask me a single question about anything else. I had to beg him to give me anything that will help break this constant mucus up. All the while he was trying to get out the door asap. Now he wants me to spend 260 on a sleep study insurance mysteriously says they\\'ll cover, but doesn\\'t the woman at the desk says. \\n\\n\\nQ- He gave me Spiriva respiramat when I asked for something for my sticky difficult to deal with mucus in my throat and nose. It says it commonly causes allergy infections which I get almost constantly. Experiences and thoughts anyone? I\\'m going to call the pharmacist too. Doc was useless with any question. Nurse explained how to use it, but I\\'m scared to because I\\'m so tired of being sick all the time. \\n\\nI\\'m currently on symbicort and singular. They do help, but not enough. Worked my way up from albuterol to get on what I am already. I\\'ll be trying for a second opinion in the meantime. This guy has a lot of nasty reviews but my primary recommended him so I just trusted it. My mistake.\\n\\nThanks for reading if anyone gets this far lol This just really sucked.'"

This is because inhalers help get the medicine to the airways where it’s needed. Almost everyone with asthma has a preventer inhaler and a reliever inhaler.',\n 'Almost everyone with asthma has a preventer inhaler and a reliever inhaler. Everyone with asthma can benefit from a preventer inhaler.\\nPreventer inhalers prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways. This means you’re less likely to get symptoms if you come across your asthma triggers. \\nRegular preventer medicine helps prevent asthma attacks. Reliever inhalers relieve asthma symptoms like coughing, wheezing, breathlessness, and a tight chest. You use your reliever inhaler just when you have symptoms or an asthma attack.\\nIf your asthma is well controlled, you shouldn’t need to use your reliever inhaler often - or at all. But remember to always carry it with you in case symptoms do flare up. A small number of people who have mild symptoms very infrequently may only need a reliever inhaler to use when they get symptoms. However, some studies suggest that everyone should have a preventer inhaler too, to lower their risk of asthma attacks.',\n \"If you're using your reliever inhaler three or more times a week, see your GP or asthma nurse as soon as possible to review your treatment plan. If you've only been prescribed a reliever inhaler, see your GP or asthma nurse urgently to ask for a preventer inhaler too.\",\n \"You need a preventer inhaler if you've noticed symptoms three or more times a week or you wake up at night with symptoms or you've had an asthma attack in the last two years.\",\n \"As a kind of add-on treatment, a long-acting bronchodilator opens up your airways. It contains reliever medicines that last 12 hours. It can lower your risk of asthma attacks. You must continue to take your preventer inhaler as prescribed because long-acting bronchodilators cannot deal with the inflammation in your airways. Your GP may prescribe a long-acting bronchodilator in a combination inhaler. This is one inhaler containing both the long-acting bronchodilator and your preventer medicine. You'll need your usual blue reliever inhaler too, in case you get symptoms. A certain type of long-acting bronchodilator medicine, found in MART inhalers (Maintenance and reliever therapy), can give quick relief for asthma symptoms too. This means you can use your MART inhaler as an emergency reliever as well. But not all combination inhalers can be used as a reliever so check with your GP. Make sure your GP or asthma nurse explains what your long-acting bronchodilator can and cannot do.\",\n 'As a kind of add-on treatment, montelukast is a preventer tablet. It is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA). This kind of medicine helps with the inflammation in your airways. Unlike your preventer inhaler, montelukast does not contain steroids. You need to take it alongside your regular steroid preventer inhaler.',\n 'As a kind of add-on treatment, Your GP may prescribe you oral steroids (usually prednisolone) in addition to your usual asthma medicines. Steroids help you get symptoms under control in the short term, or if you’ve had an asthma attack, by reducing the inflammation in your airways. If you frequently need oral steroids, or you need to take them long-term, you should be referred to an asthma specialist to look at other ways to manage your asthma.',\n \"Call 144 for an ambulance if you're having an asthma attack and your symptoms do not improve after ten puffs, 30-60 seconds apart, of your reliever inhaler, or if you feel worse at any point.\",\n 'If you do have an asthma attack, the first line of treatment is your blue reliever inhaler. This can quickly get symptoms under control. If you need to be treated in hospital for an asthma attack, you’ll be treated with higher doses of reliever medicine. Sometimes this will be given through a nebuliser. You’ll also be given oxygen. You’ll need to take a course of steroid tablets as part of your recovery plan. See your GP for a follow up after being discharged from hospital. They can make sure you’re making a good recovery, and that you’re not at risk from another attack. Remember: taking your preventer medicine every day is the best way to prevent symptoms from building up into an asthma attack.',\n 'If you have any concerns about the treatments you’ve been prescribed you can speak to a respiratory nurse specialist on our Helpline by calling 0300 222 5800, Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm. Or you can WhatsApp them on 07378 606728.',\n 'You will probably take more medicine when you begin treatment to get control of your asthma. Work with your doctor to learn which medicine(s) control your asthma best and how much you need. Once your asthma is well-controlled, your doctor may be able to reduce the amount of medicine you take. The goal is to gain control of your asthma as soon as possible and then control it with as little medicine as possible. Once long-term anti-inflammatory therapy begins, your doctor should monitor you every one to six months. This is to see how your asthma medicines are working and if your asthma is well controlled.',\n 'Many people wake up with asthma symptoms such as coughing or wheezing. You can control nighttime symptoms by taking asthma medicines as directed by your doctor. Removing triggers where you sleep may help you sleep better. Many people are allergic to dust mites and mold found in bedding materials. Using mattress or pillow encasements can help contain those allergens. Dehumidifiers can also be helpful to reduce the humidity in your home that dust mites and mold need to exist. Using air cleaners in your bedroom may also help reduce your exposure to allergens and irritants (animal dander, dust mites, air pollution, etc.).',\n 'Exercising, particularly in cold air, may cause airway swelling or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Quick-relief asthma medicines, taken before exercise, usually control this. If you need repeated doses of quick-relief medicine during and after exercise talk with your doctor. Your medicines may need to be adjusted. Thanks to these medicines, many Olympic and professional athletes have successful sports careers even with their asthma. It is important for everyone, including people with asthma, to be as active as possible for good health. Talk with your doctor about how you can be physically active while keeping your asthma well-controlled.',\n 'All medicines have side effects. Tell your doctor how you are responding to the treatment and if you have any side effects. Follow up often with your doctor so you can control your asthma with the least amount of medicines and with the fewest side effects.',\n \"If using reliever and preventer inhalers does not control your asthma, you may need an inhaler that combines both. Combination inhalers are used every day to help stop symptoms occurring and provide long-lasting relief if they do occur. It's important to use it regularly, even if you do not have symptoms. Side effects of combination inhalers are similar to those of reliever and preventer inhalers.\",\n 'A procedure called bronchial thermoplasty may be offered as a treatment for severe asthma. It works well and there are no serious concerns about its safety. You will be sedated or put to sleep using a general anaesthetic during a bronchial thermoplasty. It involves passing a thin, flexible tube down your throat and into your lungs. Heat is then used on the muscles around the airways to help stop them narrowing and causing asthma symptoms.',\n \"If you seem to have occupational asthma, where your asthma is linked to your job, you'll be referred to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis. If your employer has an occupational health service, they should also be informed, along with your health and safety officer. Your employer has a responsibility to protect you from the causes of occupational asthma.\",\n 'If you’re using rescue inhalers (or quick-relief inhalers) more than 2 days a week, see your doctor.

They include beclomethasone (Qvar RediHaler), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), ciclesonide (Alvesco), fluticasone (Flovent HFA), and mometasone (Asmanex Twisthaler).',\n 'Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists open your airways by relaxing the smooth muscles around them. You’ll take this medication along with an inhaled corticosteroid. They include formoterol, salmeterol, and vilanterol.',\n 'Combination inhaled medicines have an inhaled corticosteroid along with a long-acting beta-agonist. This is an easy way to take them together. They include Advair, Breo, Dulera, and Symbicort.',\n 'Biologics target a cell or protein in your body to prevent airway inflammation. They may be shots or infusions you get every few weeks. They can be expensive, so you usually get them if other medications don’t work. Biologics include benralizumab (Fasenra), dupilumab (Dupixent), mepolizumab (Nucala), omalizumab (Xolair), and reslizumab (Cinqair).',\n 'Leukotriene modifiers relax the smooth muscles around your airways and ease swelling. You can take them as pills or liquids. These include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and zileuton (Zyflo).',\n 'Cromolyn prevents your airways from swelling when they come into contact with an asthma trigger. It’s a non-steroid medicine that comes in an inhaler.',\n 'Theophylline (Theo-24, Theo-Dur) relaxes the smooth muscles that narrow your airways. It comes as a tablet, capsule, solution, or syrup.',\n 'Tezepelumab-ekko (Tezspire) injection is a first-in-class medicine indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.',\n 'Long-acting bronchodilators. You might use tiotropium (Spiriva) along with corticosteroids if you have ongoing asthma symptoms even though you take a daily inhaled steroid. Never use long-acting bronchodilators alone as a long-term asthma treatment.',\n 'Corticosteroids. If no other medicine can get your asthma attacks under control, your doctor might have you take these medications for a couple of weeks. They come in pills or liquids.',\n 'If you’re having trouble using small inhalers, your doctor may recommend a nebulizer. This machine changes asthma medications from a liquid to a mist so it’s easier to get the medicine into your lungs. It also has a mouthpiece or mask that makes it a good option for infants, small children, older adults, or anyone who has trouble using inhalers with spacers. It takes a few more minutes to use than an inhaler.',\n 'Many medications have side effects. For example, inhaled steroids can cause mild problems, such as thrush infections and a sore throat, or more serious ones including eye disorders and bone loss. Keep your doctor up to date with how well your treatment is working and whether you have side effects. They’ll work with you to keep your asthma under control with as little medicine as possible.',\n 'Medications aren’t the only way to control asthma. Your doctor might also try a condition called bronchial thermoplasty. People with asthma often have extra smooth muscle in their airway walls. In this procedure, your doctor uses a small tube called a bronchoscope to send heat to the walls and reduce the smooth muscle. You’ll get the treatment over three visits about 2 or 3 weeks apart.',\n 'Breathing exercises. These can lower the amount of medication you need to control your symptoms.',\n 'Caffeine. It’s a mild bronchodilator, meaning it can open your airways, but it doesn’t work as fast as medications. Avoid caffeine for several hours before any medical appointment that might include a lung function test.',\n 'If you’ve been diagnosed with asthma but your treatment doesn’t seem to work anymore, it’s time to see your doctor again. Likewise, if you’re having to use your rescue inhaler too often, see your doctor. You may need to change your asthma treatment for better control. Though asthma is common, it’s a serious condition that needs a diagnosis and treatment. Talk to your doctor for asthma support, and find the medications that work best for you.',\n 'Treatment focuses on a person keeping their chronic symptoms in check and avoiding triggers while receiving quick relief during severe flare-ups. Doctors call a flare-up of asthma symptoms an asthma attack, and the treatment they prescribe tries to limit further attacks and reduce the need for rapid medication.\\nAlso, treatment aims to restore and maintain a person’s lung function, activity levels, and sleep patterns. As the disease has a variety of causes and people of all ages can have it, most individuals will have a different action plan and course of treatment. In this article, we explore the management options for asthma.',\n 'Typically, people should attend asthma consultations every 2 to 6 weeks after first receiving a diagnosis. However, using a peak flow meter at home to monitor the progress of their treatment can help them manage the disease in between doctor’s visits. A peak flow meter is a simple, handheld tool that can help a person maintain control of their asthma by allowing them to measure the effectiveness of air movement from their lungs. The meter reveals a “peak flow” number after a person blows into the device. A doctor will indicate how often a person should use the test, how to interpret the results, and how to judge how much medication they need to take. The doctor may request that a person either records their scores every morning or uses the peak flow meter intermittently. The monitoring aims to find and maintain a “personal best”peak flow number by recording the scores for 2 to 3 weeks after diagnosis. The personal best score will dictate the dosage and delivery method of medications. By comparing future scores with the individual’s best score, a doctor can measure whether their treatment is working. Peak flow can also warn of an oncoming asthma attack before symptoms are apparent.',\n 'A person is applying treatment effectively if the following apply:\\r\\n1. coughing and breathlessness occurs on no more than 2 days per week\\r\\n2. They need quick-relief medicines on fewer than 2 days per week\\r\\n3. they are maintaining good lung function\\r\\n4. their activity levels remaining normal\\r\\n5. asthma symptoms are waking them from sleep on fewer than 1 to 2 nights per month\\r\\n6. they do not need emergency medical treatment\\r\\n7. they are experiencing one or fewer asthma attacks per year that require corticosteroid treatment\\r\\n8. peak flow is staying higher than 80 percent of the personal best\\r\\nGood control also means people need to be avoiding asthma triggers and allergens as well.',\n 'The primary forms of quick-relief asthma medications are beta2-agonists, a class of drugs that includes:\\r\\n1. metaproterenol\\r\\n2. epinephrine, available in EpiPen and EpiPen Jr., Adrenalin, and Epinephrine Mist\\r\\n3. albuterol, under brand names that include Ventolin HFA, Proventil, and Proair\\r\\n4. levalbuterol, available as Xopenex\\r\\nMost asthma medication is available in the form of a powder or mist for oral administration with an inhaler. An inhaler is a device that “mists” the medicine, promoting more efficient and direct delivery to the lungs. Asthma medicines can sometimes take the form of a pill, as well.',\n 'A person with asthma should use these drugs daily to reduce flare-ups and ongoing symptoms. The most effective drugs for long-term asthma control are known as inhaled corticosteroids. These provide inflammation relief and reduce a person’s sensitivity to allergens and triggers. However, the medicines do have side effects, such as thrush that causes a fungal infection of the mouth. When corticosteroids reach the mouth or throat, the risk of thrush increases. Manufacturers of inhaler devices have developed spacers or holding chambers to help prevent thrush. Rinsing the mouth after inhalation can have a similar protective effect. Inhaled corticosteroids also increase the risk of cataracts and osteoporosis when a person takes them for a long time. Doctors may prescribe the following medicines on a long-term basis for people with asthma:\\n1. anti-inflammatory drugs, including cromolyn, which the person takes using a nebulizer\\n2. immunomodulators, including omalizumab, which a doctor will administer once or twice a month by injection to help reduce reactions to asthma triggers, such as pollen and dust mites\\n3. inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists, which open the airways and may feature alongside corticosteroids in the medication plan of a person with asthma\\n4. leukotriene modifiers for blocking the inflammation reaction in the airways\\n5. theophylline, an oral medication that opens the airways\\nPeople should use a quick-relief inhaler for no more than 2 days a week. Most people carry the quick-relief inhaler with them at all times and administer the medication when they first notice symptoms.\\nUsually, quick-relief medicines do not reduce inflammation, so a person should avoid using them for long-term control of their condition.',\n 'While researchers have explored nonmedical remedies for asthma symptoms, no research is currently available to confirm the effectiveness of anything other than conventional treatment for managing asthma. Nonmedical treatments, as yet unconfirmed, include acupuncture, breathing exercises, and placebo medications.

It’s a chronic (ongoing) condition, meaning it doesn’t go away and needs ongoing medical management. Asthma affects more than 25 million people in the U.S. currently. This total includes more than 5 million children. Asthma can be life-threatening if you don’t get treatment.',\n 'When you breathe normally, muscles around your airways are relaxed, letting air move easily and quietly. During an asthma attack, three things can happen:\\n\\nBronchospasm: The muscles around the airways constrict (tighten). When they tighten, it makes your airways narrow. Air cannot flow freely through constricted airways.\\nInflammation: The lining of your airways becomes swollen. Swollen airways don’t let as much air in or out of your lungs.\\nMucus production: During the attack, your body creates more mucus. This thick mucus clogs airways.\\nWhen your airways get tighter, you make a sound called wheezing when you breathe, a noise your airways make when you breathe out. You might also hear an asthma attack called an exacerbation or a flare-up. It’s the term for when your asthma isn’t controlled.',\n 'Anyone can develop asthma at any age. People with allergies or people exposed to tobacco smoke are more likely to develop asthma. This includes secondhand smoke (exposure to someone else who is smoking) and thirdhand smoke (exposure to clothing or surfaces in places where some has smoked). Statistics show that people assigned female at birth tend to have asthma more than people assigned male at birth. Asthma affects Black people more frequently than other races.',\n 'Researchers don’t know why some people have asthma while others don’t. But certain factors present a higher risk:Allergies: Having allergies can raise your risk of developing asthma. Environmental factors: People can develop asthma after exposure to things that irritate the airways. These substances include allergens, toxins, fumes and second- or third-hand smoke. These can be especially harmful to infants and young children whose immune systems haven’t finished developing. Genetics: If your family has a history of asthma or allergic diseases, you have a higher risk of developing the disease. Respiratory infections: Certain respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can damage young children’s developing lungs.',\n 'You can have an asthma attack if you come in contact with substances that irritate you. Healthcare providers call these substances “triggers.” Knowing what triggers your asthma makes it easier to avoid asthma attacks. For some people, a trigger can bring on an attack right away. For other people, or at other times, an attack may start hours or days later. Triggers can be different for each person. But some common triggers include: Air pollution: Many things outside can cause an asthma attack. Air pollution includes factory emissions, car exhaust, wildfire smoke and more. Dust mites: You can’t see these bugs, but they are in our homes. If you have a dust mite allergy, this can cause an asthma attack. Exercise: For some people, exercising can cause an attack. Mold: Damp places can spawn mold, which can cause problems if you have asthma. You don’t even have to be allergic to mold to have an attack. Pests: Cockroaches, mice and other household pests can cause asthma attacks.\\r\\nPets: Your pets can cause asthma attacks. If you’re allergic to pet dander (dried skin flakes), breathing in the dander can irritate your airways. Tobacco smoke: If you or someone in your home smokes, you have a higher risk of developing asthma. You should never smoke in enclosed places like the car or home, and the best solution is to quit smoking. Your provider can help. Strong chemicals or smells. These things can trigger attacks in some people. Certain occupational exposures. You can be exposed to many things at your job, including cleaning products, dust from flour or wood, or other chemicals. These can all be triggers if you have asthma.',\n 'People with asthma usually have obvious symptoms. These signs and symptoms resemble many respiratory infections: Chest tightness, pain or pressure. Coughing (especially at night). Shortness of breath. Wheezing. With asthma, you may not have all of these symptoms with every flare. You can have different symptoms and signs at different times with chronic asthma. Also, symptoms can change between asthma attacks.',\n 'Your healthcare provider will review your medical history, including information about your parents and siblings. Your provider will also ask you about your symptoms. Your provider will need to know any history of allergies, eczema (a bumpy rash caused by allergies) and other lung diseases.

Your healthcare provider may order a chest X-ray, blood test or skin test.',\n 'You have options to help manage your asthma. Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to control symptoms. These include: Bronchodilators: These medicines relax the muscles around your airways. The relaxed muscles let the airways move air. They also let mucus move more easily through the airways. These medicines relieve your symptoms when they happen and are used for intermittent and chronic asthma. Anti-inflammatory medicines: These medicines reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways. They make it easier for air to enter and exit your lungs. Your healthcare provider may prescribe them to take every day to control or prevent your symptoms of chronic asthma.\\nBiologic therapies for asthma: These are used for severe asthma when symptoms persist despite proper inhaler therapy.\\nYou can take asthma medicines in several different ways. You may breathe in the medicines using a metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer or another type of asthma inhaler.

There are other respiratory diseases that make it hard to breathe or cause coughing and wheezing.',\n 'Asthma that gets worse at night is sometimes called nighttime asthma or nocturnal asthma. There are no definite reasons that this happens, but there are some educated guesses. These include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way you sleep: Sleeping on your back can result in mucus dripping into your throat or acid reflux coming back up from your stomach. Also, sleeping on your back puts pressure on your chest and lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. However, lying face down or on your side can put pressure on your lungs.\\r\\nTriggers in your bedroom and triggers that happen in the evening: You may find your blankets, sheets and pillows have dust mites, mold or pet hair on them. If you’ve been outside in the early evening, you may have brought pollen in with you.\\r\\nMedication side effects: Some drugs that treat asthma, such as steroids and montelukast, can affect your sleep.\\r\\nAir that’s too hot or too cold: Hot air can cause airways to narrow when you breathe in. Cold air is an asthma trigger for some people.\\r\\nLung function changes: Lung function lessens at night as a natural process.\\r\\nAsthma is poorly controlled during the day: Symptoms that aren’t controlled during the day won’t be better at night. It’s important to work with your provider to make sure your asthma symptoms are controlled both day and night. Treating nighttime symptoms is very important. Serious asthma attacks, and sometimes deaths, can happen at night.',\n 'If you have asthma that is moderate-to-severe, or if your asthma symptoms aren’t well controlled, you’re at greater risk of having to be hospitalized if you get COVID-19. Therefore, you should wear a mask if you go to indoor spaces with other people, get vaccinated and avoid exposure to people who have the virus.',\n \"Common asthma signs and symptoms in children ages 5 to 11 include:\\r\\n\\r\\nCoughing, particularly at night\\r\\nWheezing\\r\\nDifficulty breathing\\r\\nChest pain, tightness or discomfort\\r\\nAvoiding or losing interest in sports or physical activities\\r\\nSome children have few day-to-day symptoms, but have severe asthma attacks now and then. Other children have mild symptoms or symptoms that get worse at certain times. You may notice that your child's asthma symptoms get worse at night, with activity, when your child has a cold, or with triggers such as cigarette smoke or seasonal allergies.\",\n 'Risk factors\\r\\nA number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. They include:\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling\\r\\nHaving another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis — which causes red, itchy skin — or hay fever — which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes\\r\\nBeing overweight\\r\\nBeing a smoker\\r\\nExposure to secondhand smoke\\r\\nExposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution\\r\\nExposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing',\n 'Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening and require a trip to the emergency room. Signs and symptoms of an asthma emergency in children ages 5 to 11 include:\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant trouble breathing\\r\\nPersistent coughing or wheezing\\r\\nNo improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\\r\\nBeing unable to speak without gasping\\r\\nPeak flow meter readings in the red zone',\n 'For children 5 years of age and older, doctors can diagnose and monitor asthma with the same tests used for adults, such as spirometry and peak flow meters. They measure how much air your child can quickly force out of his or her lungs, an indication of how well the lungs are working.\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n 'The doctor may give your child a portable, hand-held device (peak flow meter) to measure how well his or her lungs are working. A peak flow meter measures how much air your child can quickly exhale.\\r\\n\\r\\nLow readings indicate worsening asthma. You and your child may notice low peak flow readings before symptoms become apparent. This will help you recognize when to adjust treatment to prevent an asthma flare-up.',\n 'If your child\\'s asthma symptoms are severe, your family doctor or pediatrician may refer your child to see an asthma specialist.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor will want your child to take just the right amount and type of medication needed to control his or her asthma. This will help prevent side effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on your record of how well your child\\'s current medications seem to control signs and symptoms, your child\\'s doctor may \"step up\" treatment to a higher dose or add another type of medication. If your child\\'s asthma is well controlled, the doctor may \"step down\" treatment by reducing your child\\'s medications. This is known as the stepwise approach to asthma treatment.',\n \"Known as maintenance medications, these are generally taken every day on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma. These medications may be used seasonally if your child's asthma symptoms become worse during certain times of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypes of long-term control medications include:\\r\\n\\r\\nInhaled corticosteroids. These are the most common long-term control medications for asthma. These anti-inflammatory drugs include fluticasone (Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), beclomethasone (Qvar RediHaler), ciclesonide (Alvesco, Omnaris) and mometasone (Asmanex HFA).\\r\\nLeukotriene modifiers. These include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo). They can be used alone or as an addition to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn rare cases, montelukast and zileuton have been linked to psychological reactions such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away if your child has any unusual psychological reaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombination inhalers. These medications contain an inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting beta agonist (LABA). They include the combinations fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair HFA), budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), fluticasone-vilanterol (Breo, Ellipta) and mometasone-formoterol (Dulera). In some situations, long-acting beta agonists have been linked to severe asthma attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nLABA medications should only be given to children when they are combined with a corticosteroid in a combination inhaler. This reduces the risk of a severe asthma attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheophylline. This is a daily medication that opens the airways (bronchodilator). Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin) is not used as often now as in past years.\\r\\nBiologics. Nucala, an injectable medication, is given to children every four weeks to help control severe asthma. Children age 6 and older may benefit from the addition of this therapy to their current treatment plan.\",\n \"These medications — called short-acting bronchodilators — provide immediate relief of asthma symptoms and last four to six hours. Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) is the most commonly used short-acting bronchodilator for asthma. Levalbuterol (Xopenex) is another.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough these medications work quickly, they can't keep your child's symptoms from coming back. If your child has frequent or severe symptoms, he or she will need to take a long-term control medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour child's asthma is not under control if he or she often needs to use a quick-relief inhaler. Relying on a quick-relief inhaler to control symptoms puts your child at risk of a severe asthma attack and is a sign that your child needs to see the doctor about making treatment changes. Track the use of quick-relief medications, and share the information with your child's doctor at every visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsthma attacks are treated with rescue medications, and oral or injectable corticosteroids.\",\n \"Most asthma medications are given with a device that allows a child to breathe medication directly into the lungs. Your child's medication may be delivered with one of these devices:\\r\\n\\r\\nMetered dose inhaler. Small hand-held devices, metered dose inhalers are a common delivery method for asthma medication. To make sure your child gets the correct dose, he or she may also need a hollow tube (spacer) that attaches to the inhaler.\\r\\nDry powder inhalers. For certain asthma medications, your child may have a dry powder inhaler. This device requires a deep, rapid inhalation to get the full dose of medication.\\r\\nNebulizer. A nebulizer turns medications into a fine mist your child breathes in through a face mask. Nebulizers can deliver larger doses of medications into the lungs than inhalers can. Young children often need to use a nebulizer because it's difficult or impossible for them to use other inhaler devices.\",\n \"Allergy-desensitization shots (immunotherapy) may help if your child has allergic asthma that can't be easily controlled by avoiding asthma triggers. Your child will begin with skin tests to determine which allergy-causing substances (allergens) may trigger asthma symptoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce your child's asthma triggers are identified, he or she will get a series of injections containing small doses of those allergens. Your son or daughter will probably need injections once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years. Your child's allergic reactions and asthma symptoms should gradually diminish.\\r\\n\\r\\nOmalizumab (Xolair) is an injectable treatment that can help allergic asthma that isn't well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids.\",\n \"Managing your child's asthma can seem like an overwhelming responsibility. Following these steps will help make it easier.\\r\\n\\r\\nLearn about asthma\\r\\nA critical part of managing your child's asthma is learning exactly what steps to take on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis. It's also important that you understand the purpose of each part of tracking symptoms and adjusting treatment. You, your child and caretakers need to:\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstand the different types of medications for asthma and how they work\\r\\nLearn to recognize and record signs and symptoms of worsening asthma\\r\\nKnow what to do when your child's asthma gets worse\\r\\nTrack symptoms with a written plan\\r\\nA written asthma action plan is an important tool to let you know how well treatment is working, based on your child's symptoms. With your child's doctor, create a written asthma plan that outlines the steps needed to manage your child's asthma. You and your child's caretakers, including babysitters, teachers and coaches, should have a copy of the plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan can help you and your child:\\r\\n\\r\\nTrack how often your child has asthma flare-ups (exacerbations)\\r\\nJudge how well medications are controlling symptoms\\r\\nNote any medication side effects, such as shaking, irritability or trouble sleeping\\r\\nCheck how well your child's lungs are working with a peak flow meter\\r\\nMeasure how much your child's symptoms affect daily activities such as play, sleep and sports\\r\\nAdjust medications when symptoms get worse\\r\\nRecognize when to see a doctor or seek emergency care\\r\\nMany asthma plans use a stoplight system of green, yellow and red zones that correspond to worsening symptoms. This system can help you quickly determine asthma severity and identify signs of an asthma attack. Some asthma plans use a symptoms questionnaire called the Asthma Control Test to measure asthma severity over the past month.\\r\\n\\r\\nControl asthma triggers\\r\\nTaking steps to help your child avoid triggers is an important part of controlling asthma. Asthma triggers vary from child to child. Work with your child's doctor to identify triggers and steps you can take to help your child avoid them. Common asthma triggers include:\\r\\n\\r\\nColds or other respiratory infections\\r\\nAllergens such as dust mites or pollen\\r\\nPet dander\\r\\nExercise\\r\\nCold weather\\r\\nMold and dampness\\r\\nCockroach exposure\\r\\nCigarette smoke and other irritants in the air\\r\\nSevere heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD)\",\n 'Other drugs are used in asthma treatment uncommonly and in specific circumstances. Magnesium is often used in the emergency department, but it is not recommended in the management of chronic asthma.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmunotherapy may be indicated when symptoms are triggered by allergy, as suggested by history and confirmed by allergy testing. Immunotherapy is generally more effective in children than adults. If symptoms are not significantly relieved after 24 months, then therapy is stopped. If symptoms are relieved, therapy should continue for ≥ 3 years, although the optimum duration is unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther drugs that suppress the immune system are occasionally given to reduce dependence on high-dose oral corticosteroids, but these drugs have a significant risk of toxicity. Low-dose methotrexate (5 to 15 mg orally or IM once a week) can lead to modest improvements in FEV1 and modest decreases in daily oral corticosteroid use. Gold and cyclosporine are also modestly effective, but toxicity and need for monitoring limit their use.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther therapies for management of chronic asthma include nebulized lidocaine, nebulized heparin, colchicine, and high-dose IV immune globulin. Limited evidence supports the use of any of these therapies, and their benefits are unproved, so none are currently recommended for routine clinical use.',\n 'Beta agonists\\r\\nBeta2-adrenergic receptor agonists and beta agonists relax bronchial smooth muscle, decrease mast cell degranulation and histamine release, inhibit microvascular leakage into the airways, and increase mucociliary clearance. Beta-2 agonist preparations may be short-acting, long-acting, or ultra–long-acting (see tables Drug Treatment of Chronic Asthma and Drug Treatment of Asthma Exacerbations).\\r\\n\\r\\nShort-acting beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol) 2 puffs every 4 hours inhaled as needed are the drug of choice for relieving acute bronchoconstriction and preventing exercise-induced asthma. They should not be used alone for long-term maintenance of chronic asthma. They take effect within minutes and are active for up to 6 to 8 hours, depending on the drug. Tachycardia and tremor are the most common acute adverse effects of inhaled beta agonists and are dose-related. Mild hypokalemia occurs uncommonly. Use of levalbuterol (a solution containing the R-isomer of albuterol) theoretically minimizes adverse effects, but its long-term efficacy and safety are unproved. Oral beta agonists have more systemic effects and generally should be avoided.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-acting beta agonists (eg, salmeterol) are active for up to 12 hours. They are used for moderate and severe asthma but should never be used as monotherapy. They interact synergistically with inhaled corticosteroids and permit lower dosing of corticosteroids.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltra-long-acting beta agonists (eg, indacaterol) are active for up to 24 hours and as with long-acting beta agonists are used for moderate to severe asthma, and should never be used as a monotherapy. They interact synergistically with inhaled corticosteroids and permit lower dosing of corticosteroids.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety of regular long-term use of beta agonists has been confirmed by multiple randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses, including a large international safety study that was followed by removal of a black box warning by the Food and Drug Administration (1). Because the safety and efficacy of long-acting beta agonists have been demonstrated only when used in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid, all long-acting and ultra-long beta agonists should be used only in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid for patients whose condition is not adequately controlled with other asthma controllers (eg, low- to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly warrants additional maintenance therapies. Daily use or diminishing effects of short-acting beta agonists or use of ≥ 1 canister per month suggests inadequate control and the need to begin or intensify other therapies.',\n '\\r\\nAsthma is a disease that affects your lungs. It is one of the most common long-term diseases of children, but adults can have asthma, too. Asthma causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing at night or early in the morning. If you have asthma, you have it all the time, but you will have asthma attacks only when something bothers your lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe don’t know all the things that can cause asthma, but we do know that genetic, environmental, and occupational factors have been linked to developing asthma.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf someone in your immediate family has asthma, you are more likely to have it. “Atopy,” the genetic tendency to develop an allergic disease, can play a big part in developing allergic asthma. However, not all asthma is allergic asthma.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing exposed to things in the environment, like mold or dampness, some allergens such as dust mites, and secondhand tobacco smoke have been linked to developing asthma. Air pollution and viral lung infection may also lead to asthma.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupational asthma occurs when someone who never had asthma develops it because he or she is exposed to something at work. This can happen if you develop an allergy to something at work such as mold or if you are exposed to irritants such as wood dust or chemicals at work over and over at lower levels or all at once at higher levels.',\n '\\r\\nIt can be hard to tell if someone has asthma, especially in children under age 5. Having a doctor check how well your lungs work and check for allergies can help you find out if you have asthma.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a checkup, a doctor will ask if you cough a lot, especially at night. He or she will also ask whether your breathing problems are worse after physical activity or at certain times of year. The doctor will then ask about chest tightness, wheezing, and colds lasting more than 10 days. He or she will ask whether anyone in your family has or has had asthma, allergies, or other breathing problems. Finally, the doctor will ask questions about your home and whether you have missed school or work or have trouble doing certain things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor may also do a breathing test, called spirometry, to find out how well your lungs are working by testing how much air you can breathe out after taking a very deep breath before and after you use asthma medicine.',\n 'An asthma attack may include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, and trouble breathing. The attack happens in your body’s airways, which are the paths that carry air to your lungs. As the air moves through your lungs, the airways become smaller, like the branches of a tree are smaller than the tree trunk. During an asthma attack, the sides of the airways in your lungs swell and the airways shrink. Less air gets in and out of your lungs, and mucous that your body makes clogs up the airways.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can control your asthma by knowing the warning signs of an asthma attack, staying away from things that cause an attack, and following your doctor’s advice. When you control your asthma:\\r\\n\\r\\nyou won’t have symptoms such as wheezing or coughing,\\r\\nyou’ll sleep better,\\r\\nyou won’t miss work or school,\\r\\nyou can take part in all physical activities, and\\r\\nyou won’t have to go to the hospital.',\n 'An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to “asthma triggers.” Your asthma triggers can be very different from someone else’s asthma triggers. Know your triggers and learn how to avoid them. Watch out for an attack when you can’t avoid your triggers. Some of the most common triggers are tobacco smoke, dust mites, outdoor air pollution, cockroach allergen, pets, mold, smoke from burning wood or grass, and infections like flu.',\n 'Take your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you and stay away from things that can trigger an attack to control your asthma.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone with asthma does not take the same medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can breathe in some medicines and take other medicines as a pill. Asthma medicines come in two types—quick-relief and long-term control. Quick-relief medicines control the symptoms of an asthma attack. If you need to use your quick-relief medicines more and more, visit your doctor to see if you need a different medicine. Long-term control medicines help you have fewer and milder attacks, but they don’t help you while you are having an asthma attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsthma medicines can have side effects, but most side effects are mild and soon go away. Ask your doctor about the side effects of your medicines.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember – you can control your asthma. With your doctor’s help, make your own asthma action plan. Decide who should have a copy of your plan and where he or she should keep it. Take your long-term control medicine even when you don’t have symptoms.',\n 'Doing Well\\r\\nI don’t have cough, wheezing, chest tightness, or trouble breathing at any time.\\r\\nI can do all the things I usually do.\\r\\nWhen I use a peak flow meter my peak flow* is more than 80 percent or more of my best peak flow.\\r\\nContinue taking your long-term control medicine.\\r\\nAsthma Is Getting Worse\\r\\nI have some cough, wheezing, chest tightness, or trouble breathing.

Even among this list of genes supported by highly replicated studies, results have not been consistent among all populations tested.[74] In 2006 over 100 genes were associated with asthma in one genetic association study alone;[74] more continue to be found.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome genetic variants may only cause asthma when they are combined with specific environmental exposures.[4] An example is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism in the CD14 region and exposure to endotoxin (a bacterial product). Endotoxin exposure can come from several environmental sources including tobacco smoke, dogs, and farms. Risk for asthma, then, is determined by both a person's genetics and the level of endotoxin exposure.[72]\",\n 'A triad of atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis and asthma is called atopy.[76] The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease;[63] with asthma occurring at a much greater rate in those who have either eczema or hay fever.[77] Asthma has been associated with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg–Strauss syndrome), an autoimmune disease and vasculitis.[78] Individuals with certain types of urticaria may also experience symptoms of asthma.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a correlation between obesity and the risk of asthma with both having increased in recent years.[79][80] Several factors may be at play including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of fat and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeta blocker medications such as propranolol can trigger asthma in those who are susceptible.[82] Cardioselective beta-blockers, however, appear safe in those with mild or moderate disease.[83][84] Other medications that can cause problems in asthmatics are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and NSAIDs.[85] Use of acid suppressing medication (proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers) during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma in the child.[86]',\n 'Some individuals will have stable asthma for weeks or months and then suddenly develop an episode of acute asthma. Different individuals react to various factors in different ways.[87] Most individuals can develop severe exacerbation from a number of triggering agents.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nHome factors that can lead to exacerbation of asthma include dust, animal dander (especially cat and dog hair), cockroach allergens and mold.[87][88] Perfumes are a common cause of acute attacks in women and children. Both viral and bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract can worsen the disease.[87] Psychological stress may worsen symptoms – it is thought that stress alters the immune system and thus increases the airway inflammatory response to allergens and irritants.[44][89]\\r\\n\\r\\nAsthma exacerbations in school‐aged children peak in autumn, shortly after children return to school. This might reflect a combination of factors, including poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and altered immune tolerance. There is limited evidence to guide possible approaches to reducing autumn exacerbations, but while costly, seasonal omalizumab treatment from four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations.[90]',\n \"Asthma is the result of chronic inflammation of the conducting zone of the airways (most especially the bronchi and bronchioles), which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding smooth muscles. This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing. The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment. Occasionally the airways themselves change.[21] Typical changes in the airways include an increase in eosinophils and thickening of the lamina reticularis. Chronically the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands. Other cell types involved include T lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. There may also be involvement of other components of the immune system, including cytokines, chemokines, histamine, and leukotrienes among others.[20]\",\n 'While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[20] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as \"a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is currently no precise test for the diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time.[5][20] Asthma may be suspected if there is a history of recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution.[91] Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis.[91] In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpirometry\\r\\nSpirometry is recommended to aid in diagnosis and management.[93][94] It is the single best test for asthma. If the FEV1 measured by this technique improves more than 12% and increases by at least 200 milliliters following administration of a bronchodilator such as salbutamol, this is supportive of the diagnosis. It however may be normal in those with a history of mild asthma, not currently acting up.[20] As caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma, the use of caffeine before a lung function test may interfere with the results.[95] Single-breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from COPD.[20] It is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person\\'s asthma is controlled.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers\\r\\nThe methacholine challenge involves the inhalation of increasing concentrations of a substance that causes airway narrowing in those predisposed. If negative it means that a person does not have asthma; if positive, however, it is not specific for the disease.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther supportive evidence includes: a ≥20% difference in peak expiratory flow rate on at least three days in a week for at least two weeks, a ≥20% improvement of peak flow following treatment with either salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids or prednisone, or a ≥20% decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger.[97] Testing peak expiratory flow is more variable than spirometry, however, and thus not recommended for routine diagnosis. It may be useful for daily self-monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for checking the effectiveness of new medications. It may also be helpful in guiding treatment in those with acute exacerbations.[98]',\n 'Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.[11] Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic), based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens (atopic) or not (non-atopic).[12] While asthma is classified based on severity, at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system.[99] Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough asthma is a chronic obstructive condition, it is not considered as a part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as this term refers specifically to combinations of disease that are irreversible such as bronchiectasis and emphysema.[100] Unlike these diseases, the airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible; however, if left untreated, the chronic inflammation from asthma can lead the lungs to become irreversibly obstructed due to airway remodeling.[101] In contrast to emphysema, asthma affects the bronchi, not the alveoli.[102] The combination of asthma with a component of irreversible airways obstruction has been termed the asthma-chronic obstructive disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS). Compared to other people with \"pure\" asthma or COPD, people with ACOS exhibit increased morbidity, mortality and possibly more comorbidities.[103]',\n 'An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an asthma attack. The classic symptoms are shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness.[20] The wheezing is most often when breathing out.[105] While these are the primary symptoms of asthma,[106] some people present primarily with coughing, and in severe cases, air motion may be significantly impaired such that no wheezing is heard.[104] In children, chest pain is often present.[107]\\n\\nSigns occurring during an asthma attack include the use of accessory muscles of respiration (sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles of the neck), there may be a paradoxical pulse (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation), and over-inflation of the chest.[108] A blue color of the skin and nails may occur from lack of oxygen.[109]\\n\\nIn a mild exacerbation the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is ≥200 L/min, or ≥50% of the predicted best.[110] Moderate is defined as between 80 and 200 L/min, or 25% and 50% of the predicted best, while severe is defined as ≤ 80 L/min, or ≤25% of the predicted best.[110]\\n\\nAcute severe asthma, previously known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators and corticosteroids.[111] Half of cases are due to infections with others caused by allergen, air pollution, or insufficient or inappropriate medication use.[111]\\n\\nBrittle asthma is a kind of asthma distinguishable by recurrent, severe attacks.[104] Type 1 brittle asthma is a disease with wide peak flow variability, despite intense medication. Type 2 brittle asthma is background well-controlled asthma with sudden severe exacerbations.[104]',\n 'Exercise can trigger bronchoconstriction both in people with or without asthma.[112] It occurs in most people with asthma and up to 20% of people without asthma.[112] Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is common in professional athletes. The highest rates are among cyclists (up to 45%), swimmers, and cross-country skiers.[113] While it may occur with any weather conditions, it is more common when it is dry and cold.[114] Inhaled beta2-agonists do not appear to improve athletic performance among those without asthma,[115] however, oral doses may improve endurance and strength.[116][117]',\n 'Asthma as a result of (or worsened by) workplace exposures is a commonly reported occupational disease.[118] Many cases, however, are not reported or recognized as such.[119][120] It is estimated that 5–25% of asthma cases in adults are work-related. A few hundred different agents have been implicated, with the most common being: isocyanates, grain and wood dust, colophony, soldering flux, latex, animals, and aldehydes. The employment associated with the highest risk of problems include: those who spray paint, bakers and those who process food, nurses, chemical workers, those who work with animals, welders, hairdressers and timber workers.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nAspirin-induced asthma\\r\\nMain article: Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease\\r\\nAspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also known as aspirin-induced asthma, affects up to 9% of asthmatics.[121] AERD consists of asthma, nasal polyps, sinus disease, and respiratory reactions to aspirin and other NSAID medications (such as ibuprofen and naproxen).[122] People often also develop loss of smell and most experience respiratory reactions to alcohol.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlcohol-induced asthma\\r\\nMain article: Alcohol-induced respiratory reactions\\r\\nAlcohol may worsen asthmatic symptoms in up to a third of people.[124] This may be even more common in some ethnic groups such as the Japanese and those with aspirin-induced asthma.[124] Other studies have found improvement in asthmatic symptoms from alcohol.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-atopic asthma\\r\\nNon-atopic asthma, also known as intrinsic or non-allergic, makes up between 10 and 33% of cases. There is negative skin test to common inhalant allergens. Often it starts later in life, and women are more commonly affected than men. Usual treatments may not work as well.[125] The concept that \"non-atopic\" is synonymous with \"non-allergic\" is called into question by epidemiological data that the prevalence of asthma is closely related to the serum IgE level standardized for age and sex (P<0.0001), indicating that asthma is almost always associated with some sort of IgE-related reaction and therefore has an allergic basis, although not all the allergic stimuli that cause asthma appear to have been included in the battery of aeroallergens studied (the \"missing antigen(s)\" hypothesis).[126] For example, an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of population-attributable risk (PAR) of Chlamydia pneumoniae biomarkers in chronic asthma found that the PAR for C. pneumoniae-specific IgE was 47%.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nInfectious asthma\\r\\nWhen queried, asthma patients may report that their first asthma symptoms began after an acute lower respiratory tract illness. This type of history has been labelled the \"infectious asthma\" (IA) syndrome,[128] or as \"asthma associated with infection\" (AAWI)[129] to distinguish infection-associated asthma initiation from the well known association of respiratory infections with asthma exacerbations. Reported prevalences of IA for adults range from around 40% in a primary care practice[128] to 70% in a specialty practice treating mainly severe asthma patients.[130] The true population prevalence of IA in adult-onset asthma is unknown because clinicians are not trained to elicit this type of history routinely, and recollection in child-onset asthma is challenging.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferential diagnosis\\r\\nMany other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[131] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[132] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma. After the age of 65, most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD. In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi. However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and smoking cessation.[133] It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.[134][135]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevention\\r\\nThe evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[136] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[137][138] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly pet exposure may be useful.[139] Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive[140] and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet.[141]\\r\\n\\r\\nDietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective at preventing asthma in children and are not recommended.[141] Omega-3 consumption, mediterranean diet and anti-oxidants have been suggested by some studies that might help preventing crisis but the evidence is still inconclusive.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nReducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective.[118] It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affects the risk of exacerbations.[143] Immunization, however, is recommended by the World Health Organization.[144] Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma.[145]\\r\\n\\r\\nManagement\\r\\nWhile there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved.[146] The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, pets, or aspirin, and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended. Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories.[147][148] The medications listed below have demonstrated efficacy in improving asthma symptoms, however \"real world\" use-effectiveness is limited as around half of people with asthma worldwide remain sub-optimally controlled, even when treated.[149][150][151] People with asthma may remain sub-optimally controlled either because optimum doses of asthma medications do not work (called \"refractory\" asthma) or because individuals are either unable (e.g. inability to afford treatment, poor inhaler technique) or unwilling (e.g., wish to avoid side effects of corticosteroids) to take optimum doses of prescribed asthma medications (called \"difficult to treat\" asthma). In practice, it is not possible to distinguish \"refractory\" from \"difficult to treat\" categories for patients who have never taken optimum doses of asthma medications. A related issue is that the asthma efficacy trials upon which the pharmacological treatment guidelines are based have systematically excluded the majority of people with asthma.[152][153] For example, asthma efficacy treatment trials always exclude otherwise eligible people who smoke, and smoking blunts the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, the mainstay of asthma control management.[154][155][156]\\r\\n\\r\\nBronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer by mouth is recommended. For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, corticosteroids by mouth are added to these treatments.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople with asthma have higher rates of anxiety, psychological stress, and depression.[157][158] This is associated with poorer asthma control.[157] Cognitive behavioral therapy may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels in people with asthma.[157]\\r\\n\\r\\nImproving people\\'s knowledge about asthma and using a written action plan has been identified as an important component of managing asthma.[159] Providing educational sessions that include information specific to a person\\'s culture is likely effective.[160] More research is necessary to determine if increasing preparedness and knowledge of asthma among school staff and families using home-based and school interventions results in long term improvements in safety for children with asthma.[161][162][163] School-based asthma self-management interventions, which attempt to improve knowledge of asthma, its triggers and the importance of regular practitioner review, may reduce hospital admissions and emergency department visits. These interventions may also reduce the number of days children experience asthma symptoms and may lead to small improvements in asthma-related quality of life.[164] More research is necessary to determine if shared-decision-making is helpful for managing adults with asthma[165] or if a personalized asthma action plan is effective and necessary.[166] Some people with asthma use pulse oximeters to monitor their own blood oxygen levels during an asthma attack. However, there is no evidence regarding the use in these instances.[167]\\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle modification\\r\\nAvoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks. The most common triggers include allergens, smoke (from tobacco or other sources), air pollution, non selective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods.[168][169] Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids.[170] Laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma.[145] Dust mite control measures, including air filtration, chemicals to kill mites, vacuuming, mattress covers and others methods had no effect on asthma symptoms.[60] There is insufficient evidence to suggest that dehumidifiers are helpful for controlling asthma.[171]\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, exercise is beneficial in people with stable asthma.[172] Yoga could provide small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.[173] More research is necessary to determine how effective weight loss is on improving quality of life, the usage of health care services, and adverse effects for people of all ages with asthma.[174][175]\\r\\n\\r\\nMedications\\r\\nMedications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms; and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation.[147] Antibiotics are generally not needed for sudden worsening of symptoms or for treating asthma at any time.[176][177]',\n 'Short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (SABA), such as salbutamol (albuterol USAN) are the first line treatment for asthma symptoms.[7] They are recommended before exercise in those with exercise induced symptoms.[178]\\r\\nAnticholinergic medications, such as ipratropium, provide additional benefit when used in combination with SABA in those with moderate or severe symptoms and may prevent hospitalizations.[7][179][180] Anticholinergic bronchodilators can also be used if a person cannot tolerate a SABA.[100] If a child requires admission to hospital additional ipratropium does not appear to help over a SABA.[181] For children over 2 years old with acute asthma symptoms, inhaled anticholinergic medications taken alone is safe but is not as effective as inhaled SABA or SABA combined with inhaled anticholinergic medication.[182][179] Adults who receive combined inhaled medications that includes short-acting anticholinergics and SABA may be at risk for increased adverse effects such as experiencing a tremor, agitation, and heart beat palpitations compared to people who are treated with SABA by itself.[180]\\r\\nOlder, less selective adrenergic agonists, such as inhaled epinephrine, have similar efficacy to SABAs.[183] They are however not recommended due to concerns regarding excessive cardiac stimulation.[184]\\r\\nCorticosteroids can also help with the acute phase of an exacerbation because of their antiinflamatory properties. The benefit of systemic and oral corticosteroids is well established. Inhaled or nebulized corticosteroids can also be used.[142]For adults and children who are in the hospital due to acute asthma, systemic (IV) corticosteroids improve symptoms.[185][186] A short course of corticosteroids after an acute asthma exacerbation may help prevent relapses and reduce hospitalizations.[187]\\r\\nOther remedies, less established, are intravenous or nebulized magnesium sulfate and helium mixed with oxygen. Aminophylline could be used with caution as well.[142]\\r\\nMechanical ventilation is the last resort in case of severe hypoxemia.[142]\\r\\nIntravenous administration of the drug aminophylline does not provide an improvement in bronchodilation when compared to standard inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment.[188] Aminophylline treatment is associated with more adverse effects compared to inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment.[188]',\n 'Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control.[147] Inhaled forms are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed.[147] Dosage depends on the severity of symptoms.[189] High dosage and long term use might lead to the appearance of common adverse effects which are growth delay, adrenal suppression, and osteoporosis.[142] Continuous (daily) use of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than its intermitted use, seems to provide better results in controlling asthma exacerbations.[142] Commonly used corticosteroids are budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide.[142]\\nLong-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.[190][191] In children this benefit is uncertain.[190][192][191] When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects,[193] and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.[194][195] Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations.[196] Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.[196]\\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast) may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, typically also in conjunction with a LABA.[16][197][198][199] For adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well, the addition of anti-leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces the risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.[198] Anti-leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults, however there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti-leukotriene receptor alone.[200] In those under five years of age, anti-leukotriene agents were the preferred add-on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids.[142][201] A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children.[202] A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.[16][203] As of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.[16]\\nMast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are safe alternatives to corticosteroids but not preferred because they have to be administered frequently.[147][16]\\nOral Theophyllines are sometimes used for controlling chronic asthma, but their used is minimized because of their side effects.[142]\\nOmalizumab, a monoclonal Antibody Against IgE, is a novel way to lessen exacerbations by lessening the levels of circulating IgE that play a significant role at allergic asthma.[142][204]\\nAnticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide have not been shown to be beneficial for treating chronic asthma in children over 2 years old,[205] but is not suggested for routine treatment of chronic asthma in adults.[206]\\nThere is no strong evidence to recommend chloroquine medication as a replacement for taking corticosteroids by mouth (for those who are not able to tolerate inhaled steroids).[207] Methotrexate is not suggested as a replacement for taking corticosteriods by mouth (\"steroid sparing\") due to the adverse effects associated with taking methotrexate and the minimal relief provided for asthma symptoms.[208]\\nMacrolide antibiotics, particularly the azalide macrolide azithromycin, are a recently added GINA-recommended treatment option for both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe, refractory asthma based on azithromycin\\'s efficacy in reducing moderate and severe exacerbations combined.[209][210] Azithromycin\\'s mechanism of action is not established, and could involve pathogen- and/or host-directed anti-inflammatory activities.[211] Limited clinical observations suggest that some patients with new-onset asthma and with \"difficult-to-treat\" asthma (including those with the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome - ACOS) may respond dramatically to azithromycin.[212][213] However, these groups of asthma patients have not been studied in randomized treatment trials and patient selection needs to be carefully individualized.\\nFor children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.[214] In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.[215] Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.[215] Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.[215]\\n\\nDelivery methods\\nMedications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.[216] For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.[217] There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.[218] There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.[219]\\n\\nAdverse effects\\nLong-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.[220] Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth.[220][221][222] Rinsing the mouth after the use of inhaled steroids can decrease the risk of thrush.[223] Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.[224]\\n\\nOthers\\nInflammation in the lungs can be estimated by the level of exhaled nitric oxide.[225][226] The use of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO) to guide asthma medication dosing may have small benefits for preventing asthma attacks but the potential benefits are not strong enough for this approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children.[225][226]\\n\\nWhen asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups. Additional options include:\\n\\nHumidified Oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.[142]\\nCorticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone.[227] One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids.[228]\\nMagnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks.[17][229][230] In adults intravenous treatment results in a reduction of hospital admissions.[231] Low levels of evidence suggest that inhaled (nebulised) magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for treating acute asthma in adults.[232] Overall, high quality evidence do not indicate a large benefit for combining magnesium sulfate with standard inhaled treatments for adults with asthma.[232]\\nHeliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.[17]\\nIntravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.[233]\\nMethylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists.[233] Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.[234]\\nThe dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this.[235]\\nFor those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option.[236] It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.[236][237] While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown.[238]\\nMonoclonal antibody injections such as mepolizumab,[239] dupilumab,[240] or omalizumab may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma.[241] However, as of 2019 these medications are expensive and their use is therefore reserved for those with severe symptoms to achieve cost-effectiveness.[242] Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R), including mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab, in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations. There is limited evidence for improved health-related quality of life and lung function.[243]\\nEvidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.[244]\\nIt is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.[245]\\nAlternative medicine\\nMany people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[246][247] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies.\\n\\nEvidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C or vitamin E for controlling asthma.[248][249] There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced bronchospasm.[250] Fish oil dietary supplements (marine n-3 fatty acids)[251] and reducing dietary sodium[252] do not appear to help improve asthma control. In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations, however, it is not clear if this is only helpful for people who have low vitamin D levels to begin with (low baseline vitamin D).[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplements improve day-to-day asthma symptoms or a person\\'s lung function.[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that adults with asthma should avoid foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG).[254] There have not been enough high-quality studies performed to determine if children with asthma should avoid eating food that contains MSG.[254]\\n\\nAcupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use.[255][256] Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.[257] Manual therapies, including osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma.[258] The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.[148] Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use.[255] There is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma.[259]\\n\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for asthma is generally good, especially for children with mild disease.[260] Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care.[261] In 2010 the death rate was 170 per million for males and 90 per million for females.[262] Rates vary between countries by 100 fold.[262]\\n\\nGlobally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004 (16 million of which are in low and middle income countries).[263] Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade.[73] Airway remodeling is observed, but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes.[264] Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorates a decline in lung function.[265] Asthma in children also has negative effects on quality of life of their parents.[266]',\n 'Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control.[147] Inhaled forms are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed.[147] Dosage depends on the severity of symptoms.[189] High dosage and long term use might lead to the appearance of common adverse effects which are growth delay, adrenal suppression, and osteoporosis.[142] Continuous (daily) use of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than its intermitted use, seems to provide better results in controlling asthma exacerbations.[142] Commonly used corticosteroids are budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide.[142] Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.[190][191] In children this benefit is uncertain.[190][192][191] When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects,[193] and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.[194][195] Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations.[196] Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.[196] Leukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast) may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, typically also in conjunction with a LABA.[16][197][198][199] For adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well, the addition of anti-leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces the risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.[198] Anti-leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults, however there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti-leukotriene receptor alone.[200] In those under five years of age, anti-leukotriene agents were the preferred add-on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids.[142][201] A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children.[202] A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.[16][203] As of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.[16] Mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are safe alternatives to corticosteroids but not preferred because they have to be administered frequently.[147][16] Oral Theophyllines are sometimes used for controlling chronic asthma, but their used is minimized because of their side effects.[142] Omalizumab, a monoclonal Antibody Against IgE, is a novel way to lessen exacerbations by lessening the levels of circulating IgE that play a significant role at allergic asthma.[142][204] Anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide have not been shown to be beneficial for treating chronic asthma in children over 2 years old,[205] but is not suggested for routine treatment of chronic asthma in adults.[206] There is no strong evidence to recommend chloroquine medication as a replacement for taking corticosteroids by mouth (for those who are not able to tolerate inhaled steroids).[207] Methotrexate is not suggested as a replacement for taking corticosteriods by mouth (\"steroid sparing\") due to the adverse effects associated with taking methotrexate and the minimal relief provided for asthma symptoms.[208] Macrolide antibiotics, particularly the azalide macrolide azithromycin, are a recently added GINA-recommended treatment option for both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe, refractory asthma based on azithromycin\\'s efficacy in reducing moderate and severe exacerbations combined.[209][210] Azithromycin\\'s mechanism of action is not established, and could involve pathogen- and/or host-directed anti-inflammatory activities.[211] Limited clinical observations suggest that some patients with new-onset asthma and with \"difficult-to-treat\" asthma (including those with the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome - ACOS) may respond dramatically to azithromycin.[212][213] However, these groups of asthma patients have not been studied in randomized treatment trials and patient selection needs to be carefully individualized. For children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.[214] In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.[215] Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.[215] Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.[215] Delivery methods Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.[216] For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.[217] There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.[218] There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.[219] Adverse effects Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.[220] Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth.[220][221][222] Rinsing the mouth after the use of inhaled steroids can decrease the risk of thrush.[223] Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.[224] Others Inflammation in the lungs can be estimated by the level of exhaled nitric oxide.[225][226] The use of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO) to guide asthma medication dosing may have small benefits for preventing asthma attacks but the potential benefits are not strong enough for this approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children.[225][226] When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups. Additional options include: Humidified Oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.[142] Corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone.[227] One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids.[228] Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks.[17][229][230] In adults intravenous treatment results in a reduction of hospital admissions.[231] Low levels of evidence suggest that inhaled (nebulised) magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for treating acute asthma in adults.[232] Overall, high quality evidence do not indicate a large benefit for combining magnesium sulfate with standard inhaled treatments for adults with asthma.[232] Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.[17] Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.[233] Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists.[233] Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.[234] The dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this.[235] For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option.[236] It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.[236][237] While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown.[238] Monoclonal antibody injections such as mepolizumab,[239] dupilumab,[240] or omalizumab may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma.[241] However, as of 2019 these medications are expensive and their use is therefore reserved for those with severe symptoms to achieve cost-effectiveness.[242] Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R), including mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab, in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations. There is limited evidence for improved health-related quality of life and lung function.[243] Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.[244] It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.[245] Alternative medicine Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[246][247] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies. Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C or vitamin E for controlling asthma.[248][249] There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced bronchospasm.[250] Fish oil dietary supplements (marine n-3 fatty acids)[251] and reducing dietary sodium[252] do not appear to help improve asthma control. In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations, however, it is not clear if this is only helpful for people who have low vitamin D levels to begin with (low baseline vitamin D).[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplements improve day-to-day asthma symptoms or a person\\'s lung function.[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that adults with asthma should avoid foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG).[254] There have not been enough high-quality studies performed to determine if children with asthma should avoid eating food that contains MSG.[254] Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use.[255][256] Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.[257] Manual therapies, including osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma.[258] The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.[148] Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use.[255] There is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma.[259] Prognosis The prognosis for asthma is generally good, especially for children with mild disease.[260] Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care.[261] In 2010 the death rate was 170 per million for males and 90 per million for females.[262] Rates vary between countries by 100 fold.[262] Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004 (16 million of which are in low and middle income countries).[263] Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade.[73] Airway remodeling is observed, but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes.[264] Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorates a decline in lung function.[265] Asthma in children also has negative effects on quality of life of their parents.[266]',\n 'People with asthma should get a flu shot every year\\r\\nInfluenza, commonly called “the flu”, can trigger an asthma attack.

Know your triggers and learn how to avoid them. Watch out for an attack when you can’t avoid the triggers. Some of the most common triggers are:\\r\\n\\r\\nTobacco Smoke\\r\\nTobacco smoke is unhealthy for everyone, especially people with asthma. If you have asthma and you smoke, quit smoking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Secondhand smoke” is smoke created by a smoker and breathed in by a second person. Secondhand smoke can trigger an asthma attack. Make your home a smoke-free zone. Encourage household members who smoke to quit. If you have asthma, people should never smoke near you, in your home, in your car, or wherever you may spend a lot of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDust Mites\\r\\nDust mites are microscopic bugs that are in many homes. If you have asthma and are allergic to dust mites, they can trigger an asthma attack. To prevent attacks:\\r\\n\\r\\nUse allergen-proof mattress and pillowcase covers to make a barrier between dust mites and yourself.\\r\\nDon’t use down-filled pillows, quilts, or comforters.\\r\\nWash your bedding weekly and dry it completely.\\r\\nVacuum carpets, area rugs, and floors regularly using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter.\\r\\nKeep relative humidity levels in the home low, around 30- 50%.\\r\\nOutdoor Air Pollution\\r\\nOutdoor air pollution can trigger an asthma attack. This pollution can come from many sources, including factories, cars, or wildfire smoke. Wildfire smoke from burning wood or other plants is made up of a mix of harmful gases and small particles. Breathing in too much of this smoke can cause an asthma attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nPay attention to air quality forecasts on radio, television, and the internet and check your newspaper to plan your activities for when air pollution levels will be low.\\r\\n\\r\\nPests (e.g., cockroaches, mice)\\r\\nCockroaches and other pests are often found where food is eaten and crumbs are left behind. To control pests in your home:\\r\\n\\r\\nRemove as many water and food sources as you can.\\r\\nClean dishes, crumbs, and spills right away.\\r\\nStore food in airtight containers.\\r\\nKeep trash in a closed container.\\r\\nAt least every 2 to 3 days, vacuum or sweep areas that might attract cockroaches or mice.\\r\\nKeep counters, sinks, tables, and floors clean and free of clutter.\\r\\nSeal cracks or openings in cabinets, walls, baseboards, and around plumbing.\\r\\nUse pesticide baits and traps in areas away from children and pets, following manufacturers’ instructions.\\r\\nAvoid using sprays and foggers as these can cause asthma attacks.\\r\\nPets\\r\\nFurry pets can trigger an asthma attack if you are allergic to them. If you think a furry pet may be causing attacks, you may want to find the pet another home. If you can’t or don’t want to find a new home for the pet, decrease your exposure by:\\r\\n\\r\\nKeeping pets out of bedrooms,\\r\\nWashing furry pets,\\r\\nUsing an air cleaner with HEPA filter, and\\r\\nUsing allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers.\\r\\nPeople with asthma are not allergic to their pet’s fur, so trimming a pet’s fur will not help your asthma.\\r\\n\\r\\nMold\\r\\nBreathing in mold can trigger an asthma attack whether or not you are allergic to mold. Indoor mold growth is often found in damp areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, and basements, or in areas where water damage has occurred. There are many types of mold which can be found in any climate. Get rid of mold in your home to help control your attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo reduce mold exposure in your home:\\r\\n\\r\\nDry damp or wet items within 24 to 48 hours to prevent mold growth.\\r\\nFix water leaks, such as leaky plumbing, which let mold grow behind walls and under floors as soon as you can.\\r\\nReplace absorbent materials, such as ceiling tiles and carpet, if mold is present.\\r\\nUse an air conditioner or dehumidifier to maintain low indoor humidity.\\r\\nGet a small tool called a hygrometer to check humidity levels and keep them as low as you can—no higher than 50%. Humidity levels change over the course of a day, so check the humidity levels more than once a day.\\r\\nScrub mold off hard surfaces with detergent and water. Dry completely.\\r\\nEmpty and clean refrigerator and air conditioner drip pans regularly.\\r\\nRun the bathroom exhaust fan or open the window when showering.\\r\\nTo learn more about mold cleanup in the home after a flood see Homeowner’s and Renter’s Guide to Mold Cleanup After Disasters\\r\\n\\r\\nCleaning and Disinfection\\r\\nDisinfectants can trigger an asthma attack. People with asthma should try to stay away when cleaners or disinfectants are being used and right after their use. Follow these precautions when cleaning or disinfecting places where people with asthma may spend time, such as homes, schools, or workplaces:\\r\\n\\r\\nAvoid overuse of products. To help limit your exposure to asthma triggers, follow a schedule for cleaning and disinfecting to prevent overuse of products.\\r\\nUse safer products. Any disinfectant can trigger an asthma attack, but you can take steps to reduce the chances of that happening:\\r\\nUse soap and water or cleaners certified by the EPA Safer Choice programexternal icon to clean surfaces.\\r\\nClean visibly dirty surfaces before disinfecting.\\r\\nNever mix disinfectant products.\\r\\nChoose products for disinfecting that are less likely to cause an asthma attack, such as products with hydrogen peroxide (no stronger than 3%) or ethanol (ethyl alcohol). Ensure that products with hydrogen peroxide or ethanol do not contain other chemicals that can cause an asthma attack such as peroxyacetic acid or peracetic acid.\\r\\nAvoid using bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or quaternary ammonium compounds in enclosed spaces and limit their use.\\r\\nAvoid products with fragrances. The fragrances can trigger asthma attacks.\\r\\nMake sure there is enough air flow (ventilation).\\r\\nOpen doors and windows to bring in fresh air, if it’s safe to do so.\\r\\nImprove ventilation by turning on exhaust fans. Exhausting the air (blowing it outside) is the most effective way to remove disinfectant vapors.\\r\\nFor buildings with heating or cooling systems that have fresh (outdoor) air intakes, turn on the fresh air intake to bring in fresh air.\\r\\nUsing a high efficiency filter (MERV 13 or higher) with your heating and cooling system can help keep air clean by removing particles such as smoke, pollen, and traffic pollution from the air. Most air filters will not remove disinfectant vapors, though.\\r\\nMake sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions and to replace the filter as needed. Some systems cannot accept high efficiency filters. In this case, using the highest MERV rating possible will provide the most effective air cleaning.\\r\\nUse products safely and correctly.\\r\\nAlways follow the instructions on the product label. Do not mix chemical products together.\\r\\nWear protective gear such as gloves and goggles.\\r\\nSpray or pour spray products onto a cleaning cloth or paper towel instead of spraying the product directly onto the cleaning surface (if the product label allows) to help limit exposure.\\r\\nFollow EPA’s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Useexternal icon.\\r\\nAvoid disturbing dust because it can be an asthma trigger.\\r\\nMove away from the trigger (such as the area that was cleaned) if you experience an asthma attack, and follow your Asthma Action Plan. Call 911 for medical emergencies.\\r\\nTo learn more about cleaning to prevent illness in your home, including which products are effective, see Cleaning and Disinfecting your Home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Triggers\\r\\nInfections linked to influenza (flu), colds, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can trigger an asthma attack. Sinus infections, allergies, pollen, breathing in some chemicals, and acid reflux can also trigger attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysical exercise; some medicines; bad weather, such as thunderstorms or high humidity; breathing in cold, dry air; and some foods, food additives, and fragrances can also trigger an asthma attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrong emotions can lead to very fast breathing, called hyperventilation, that can also cause an asthma attack.',\n 'So I finally got my pulmonolgist appt after years of not seeing one.

Within a couple weeks of moving here, I got a pretty bad case of asthma and got an official diagnosis after 3 months of coughing and wheezing.

It is oak I assume that causes the issue. When oak pollen is high like it is today in Atlanta, my breathing just tightens up and I feel like I am suffocating. I get itchy everywhere and my eyes start to seal up and water. I used to be so bad as a kid. I was on steroids. Nasal steroids, aerobid, proventil, antihistamine eye drops, steroid cream for my eczema, and then oral antihistamines. Now as an adult it is way improved. During the Spring though I have a hard time breathing again and it frightens me. I have always been afraid of asthma I hate it very much. I used to ask my mom if I would die when I had to go to the hospital as a kid for treatments. I get very tight and I cant take a full breath on high pollen days. I find myself on oral antihistamines and then again I have to use rescue inhalers. If I dont have a rescue inhaler I drink a lot of coffee quickly and it makes me jittery, but it relieves that tightness in my chest. \\n\\nI have been thinking to try to see an allergist, though I have really bad marketplace insurance. So it would be out of pocket. Does anyone know how much allergy shots and testing runs? I hate feeling like this in the Spring. I think if my Spring allergies were gone I'd never need an inhaler again. I don't take one all year round. It is solely in March-May that it acts up. I try to live medicine free as much as possible. In California where I grew up I went to the Indian Clinic in Sacramento as we are Native. And they didn't do much for me then. You kind of get lost in the shuffle it isn't the best healthcare but I am very thankful for it as it kept me alive.

I\\'m just hoping that maybe I\\'ll find help from this sub\\'s experiences. You would be the people to know.\\n\\n\\nI had COVID at the start of 2021 which I sort of think might have acted as a trigger for something. Later that spring, I started having increasing shortness of breath until I was breathing hard even just sitting at my computer. One trip to an urgent care center later I\\'m on Prednisone and have a generic albuterol inhaler. The inhaler frankly didn\\'t do much, but man... The steroid was a miracle pill.

Air doesn\\'t go as deep, if I want to take a *deep* breath I\\'m using accessory muscles and even then I feel closed-off that far down more often than not. I have better days and worse days (which the albuterol sometimes helps... a little) but it never goes all the way away.\\n\\nHonestly the fact that it isn\\'t acute is probably what makes this the most frustrating. I push for answers, doc says \"blow into the tube\" and everyone goes, Wow your numbers look fine! *No shit* my numbers are fine because I\\'m young and healthy with no comorbidities, I don\\'t smoke or even live with people who do. But what the hell were my numbers before any of this? Because I sure as shit don\\'t know! Nobody does a PFT for someone *before* there\\'s a problem!\\n\\nSo I got bounced from my GP to a specialist office that kicked the can down the road for almost a year before I put my foot down. And the specialist spends two minutes in the room before he steps out and sends someone in who says *blow into the tube.* Oh, and come back in 3 months so we can follow up.\\n\\nI\\'m just so damn frustrated I could cry.

At 12:10 I had to take another kid up and I felt worse, so I checked again and I was at 92 with 124 heart rate. I had the nurse double check it for me.

They advised me to go to an urgent care right away, so I did.\\n\\nI was seen at the urgent care at 1:00, and my pulse ox was reading 96. They determined that I was not dehydrated, so they did blood work to see if I was anemic. While waiting around, I got back up to 98-99. Blood work found nothing out of the ordinary. I went home and laid down and made sure to drink a lot of fluids. \\n\\nCould it have been my asthma? I didn't have any of the normal symptoms of an asthma attack, but the inhaler seemed to help.

I would really appreciate some insight on this. It’s really interfering with my daily life and I’m not sure what this looks like for me long term. \\n\\nSome background information:\\n\\nGrowing up I would get a little asthma every once in a blue moon - usually after being outside or just randomly in the evening. It didn’t happen very often and I never saw a doctor or allergist about it or anything. \\n\\nIn my 20s I have worked around a lot of substances. I studied painting and sculpture in college, painted apartments, and worked as a carpenter for two years. \\n\\nOkay, my situation: \\n\\nI moved in with my girlfriend this past August and everything was fine for a few months. I’m an artist and I set up a studio space in our basement. \\n\\nI started noticing myself feeling sick (just sick/nauseous no respiratory issues) after spending a lot of time down there working on projects, so I reached out to our landlord and asked them to check it out. They checked several things and ultimately detected mold and asbestos in the basement. \\n\\nThey brought in a mold remediation company to take care of both the mold and asbestos. Me and my girlfriend were feeling good about the situation being taken care of until they started working on it the first day.\\n\\nThey started by setting up “containment” - sectioning off the basement from the rest of the house with plastic sheeting. But they didn’t do it properly at first. They literally just put little pieces of plastic sheeting on top of some but not all of the air ducts and installed a zipper door over the door to the basement. \\n\\nThey didn’t finish setting it up or securing it and didn’t shut the zipper door before starting the remediation process and the entire house flooded with dust. Me and my partner started feeling weird and we could feel it in our lungs so we left and ended up working it out with the property management co. to credit us for time away from the house while the work was completed. Because we lost all confidence in this company based on that first day, we requested that the air be tested by a third party afterwards to give us some peace of mind and they agreed. \\n\\nWe moved back in and I had a strange series of health events (some of which may not be related). Our first week back, I immediately had what I thought to be food poisoning - sick, nauseous, room spinning, etc. It went away after a couple days and then I had an anaphylactic reaction to something - I’m still not sure what. I’ve never had anything like that happen before. And ever since that happened, I have been dealing with breathing problems. \\n\\nIt started as shortness of breath here and there and some sinus issues and progressed to a laundry list of issues that come and go: Dry sinus congestion, a kind of “itch” feeling in the back of my throat, difficulty swallowing, a lump in my throat feeling, dry mucus feeling from my throat down into my chest, breathing difficulty, and just general malaise. \\n\\nThe air in my house feels dry and kind of chalky, especially when the furnace is going. They ended up replacing a lot of the air ducts down in the basement with old, rusty looking ones for some reason. \\n\\nMe and my partner were able to get away for a few days recently and initially we felt so much better. My breathing felt almost normal after a few days, although a lot of my other symptoms persisted. We went back, and it got worse. But then we stayed away a few more days and it has been coming and going, so I’m really at a loss here figuring this out. \\n\\nI’ve been working with a primary care doctor and an allergist, who suspect I have asthma. I haven’t received very good answers from them about what is going on yet. What I do know is I am a bit allergic to a lot of environmental things indoor and outdoor - I took an allergy test. I was prescribed several things from the allergist and am waiting to follow up with them and my regular doctor. I also have a pulmonary test coming up. \\n\\nMe and my partner are trying to get out of our lease and moved ASAP.\\n\\n I know what asthma typically feels like for me experiencing it growing up here and there and now I absolutely experience it when I work with wood and what I have been feeling is different. It’s hard to explain, it’s just not as wheezy, it’s never affected my throat or sinuses like this before, and my chest feels very different. \\n\\nIt could be mold, or dust, or a coincidence, but I’m just trying my best to figure this out.

Anyone experience this? Or maybe its just my improvement showing? Confuzeeed...\\n\\nLong story:\\nI've been asthmatic for about 10 years now and have never controlled it well at all. Never took my preventative inhaler regularly and also smoking weed and tobacco daily pretty much every day since before i was diagnosed with asthma. \\nI've had my ups and downs though and quit smoking a few times which never stuck though.\\nRecently i started having more problems after a cold or flu which left me coughing more than i usually do (i have a heavy asthma cough all year round), tight chest, etc so i have given all my willpower into trying to get my asthma under control.\\nI am tracking my peak flow daily, taking my preventative inhaler as prescribed and am smoking less and less each day. Didn't even have a cig in 3 days anymore and its been great. \\nOf course i don't expect to have it under control in a week so I'm still getting tight chests quite a lot.

I have several stories that stick out in my mind…\\n\\n1. When I was in high school, I started getting my yearly fall/winter flare up and decided to go to an urgent care since it would have taken weeks to see my primary care. When the doctor, an older gentleman, came in, I let him know I’d been using my nebulizer and rescue inhaler. He LITERALLY asked me “Okay, so what do you want me to do about it?” I looked him in the eye and said “Prescribe me a prednisone pack so I can nip this in the bud.” Needless to say, I was SHOCKED that I needed to tell a grown man who spent years in mes school what to do.\\n\\n2. My senior year in college, I came down with a BAD case of asthmatic bronchitis during the winter. I couldn’t get more than 3 words out without going into a coughing fit. I went to the local Urgent Care, and they gave me ANTIBIOTICS. Needless to say, that did fuck-all nothing. So I went back, because I was still having so much trouble, and asked for a breathing treatment. They told me I didn’t need it. I was only taken seriously when I had my friend take me to the ER where I FINALLY got the breathing treatment, a prednisone prescription, a steroid shot, and an X-Ray that confirmed it wasn’t pneumonia.\\n\\n3. I had a spring flare up in 2021, and went to a different Urgent Care. Upon entry and telling them I was having an asthma flare up, they took my pulse-ox and told me it was anxiety. I had to insist it was asthma before they actually saw me. (I do have anxiety, but I know what a flare up is if I’m panting just walking the short distance to the front door from my car in the parking lot.)\\n\\n4. After I got my second round of the Pfizer COVID vaccine later that year, I got another flare up to the point my chest hurt. My roommate took me to the ER, and when I was finally seen the doctor told me it was GERD. I do have acid reflux, but the pain I get from that when it’s not maintained is usually in my throat, not my chest. He gave me a breathing treatment anyway and prescribed a antacid.\\n\\nI genuinely do not know if anyone else with asthma has experienced something like this, but it’s really pissing me off. Advice on how to deal with this in the future would be appreciated. If you have your own horror stories, please also let me know.',\n 'Eosinophilic asthma - a kind of asthma that most often makes in adults - is separate by an extended number of white bloods called eosinophils in the blood, lungs, and respiratory tract. Raised levels of eosinophils can cause bothering and expanding in the flight courses and respiratory system.\\n\\nThat is where eosinophilic asthma comes in. Its experts call it a subtype of asthma. Researchers are at this point working out how to describe these subtypes, and it is critical work since it could provoke interesting, additional convincing medications.\\n\\nUntil very recently, eosinophilic asthma inferred more normal asthma attacks and a lower quality of life. But an understanding of subtypes has led to new medicines that are quickly changing that picture.',\n 'This year has been really bad, could my asthma have come back and that’s what’s been causing what I thought was anxiety?',\n \"i got told i have allergic asthma - after  they heard wheezing and my chest and throat tightens  . i'm currently waiting for a primary doc appt - i have allergist too not sure how to tell about this \\n\\ni noticed my allergy meds aren't working and  multiple times i have had shortness of breath hour after a straining to go the bathroom\",\n \"Tl;dr: I have severe asthma and it's extremely difficult everyday. I  have been missing class and doing horrible in school.  Medications do not seem to be helping and I'm on my last leg. Is there anything I can do to try and make it through this. \\n\\nFor 2 years I (21f) have been dealing with asthma. I suspect I've always had it but it's never gotten to the point where I needed inhalers until about 2 years ago. Only in January did I go through asthma testing at a pulmonologist because doctors kept telling me that I was just experiencing panic attacks (I also have anxiety) and no one has actually told me I had asthma until January. After the test they concluded that I have it pretty bad. Highest lung inflammation numbers they've ever seen. Anyways, I have only been trying maintenance inhalers since then and for a whole month I took Symbicort but only once a day (it did not help) because that's what the box said, I go back to the pulmonologist and he tells me I should have been taking it twice a day and he also put me on singular and prednisone. The prednisone actually did improve things but not nearly enough to where I could operate like a normal human being. Now that I am off the prednisone I feel especially horrible. I've been taking the Symbicort twice a day for like a week and a half and I am seeing no improvements (the only thing it seems to do is lessen wheezing attacks but I now deal with constant chest tightest and heaviness that only lets up for like an half an hour hear and there during the day).\\n\\nThe real problem here is that I only have 2 months left until I am supposed to graduate and get my degree. And my history of straight A's is completely screwed up, now I am actually failing a class and I missed a test that I could not make up due to an attack. Going to school is literal hell. I sit there and seriously worry if I am going to die right then and there. Almost every time I go to class I have to leave and take albuterol. But my asthma is so bad that it doesn't do anything to help. I just take it so I can find some comfort that I won't die. Also, wherever I go I have a pulse oximeter to check my blood oxygen bc I think if that gets too low then I'm in trouble, but so far the readings have been anywhere between 96-99. I think it dipped one time to 90 but I took it again and it went back up, idk. \\n\\nIt is very scary being alone and at school when I can barely breathe all day. I've been having to get rides to school from someone lately because attacks have happened when I drive and I need to pull over. My pulmonologist never said that I was gonna keel over from this but like it feels I am on the verge of dying from this shit. I'm not even being dramatic I am in pure distress right now and have no idea how I am going to make it for the next days, weeks and months and how I am going to graduate with this medical crisis going on. \\n\\nThank goodness I am on my parent's insurance and can even go to a doctor and afford this really expensive medication.

What are the Risks?](https://preview.redd.it/fvdva4cnkrm81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40605325f81417bf6fa4f6fb85a41aacbffd743e)\\n\\nPatients with asthma face several complications due to their congested oxygen sacs, such as Emphysema. That’s because asthma makes your respiratory system vulnerable, and it is susceptible to any hazardous substances entering it. In this regard, there are various risks associated with asthma causing emphysema.  \\n\\n\\n*So, let’s pen them down for you.*  \\n\\n\\n**What is Emphysema?**  \\nEmphysema is a chronic respiratory disease that can develop gradually through mild respiratory disorders. In emphysema, the lungs’ alveoli are destroyed with lung tissue damage. This condition does not let the oxygen pass through the blood vessel and creates a big bag of air in the lungs resulting in the blockage of breathing.   \\n**How can Asthma Cause Emphysema?**  \\nAsthma is a respiratory condition that can also become a stimulating factor for encouraging emphysema to occur. That’s because asthma is a prevalent disease, and people most probably develop this disease early in their lives. The causes of asthma are not precisely known, but it is more likely to be transmitted through genes or caused by allergens.   \\n\\n\\nHowever, once you are diagnosed with asthma, it does not cure with treatments but can only be controlled through inhalers. In this regard, patients who have developed asthma early in their lives may experience emphysema later in their lives since the inflamed bronchi and oxygen sacs can deteriorate over time leading to lung tissue damages. Additionally, acute asthma attacks caused by excessive smoking can also trigger emphysema.   \\n\\n\\n**Risks**  \\nEmphysema is an acute respiratory disease that can associate several health risks. For example, asthma-caused emphysema can induce symptoms of lung damage, pneumothorax, cardiac failures, bullae (holes in lungs). These diseases are life-threatening and can incur in case of avoiding treatments. \\n\\n**Treatment**  \\nIf you have developed asthma early in life, there are certain things to avoid not to cause emphysema. That’s because the primary cause of emphysema is that patients with asthma do not maintain their lifestyle by taking precautions for preventing acute prolonged asthma such as smoking. Moreover, avoiding proper medication for asthma can also deteriorate the situation. However, you can buy [Clenil,](https://www.pharmacyplanet.com/clenil-inhaler.html) Spiriva, and [Symbicort inhalers online in the Uk](https://www.pharmacyplanet.com/symbicort-turbohaler.html) to control your asthma.',\n 'I’m currently getting pain in my upper back, it doesn’t really feel muscular, it gets bad when lying on it her relieves when pressure is off.

It is always the day before rain(or snow) where I just have to take my rescue inhaler a good amount and then the day it rains I’m usually better. Is there anything I can do to relieve this?',\n 'Lesson learned, so I thought I\\'d share it with you folks here. But let me give some context. Sorry if this is long. \\n\\nSince Christmas we\\'ve been nailed by at least 6 respiratory viruses in our family, Covid included. I\\'ve had to go on a course of Prednisone 3 times. This last virus has been the worst of all of them (yes even worse than Covid). So last Wednesday I was taking my meds and I noticed I was out of Prednisone. I always put them in a little pill container for the week so I figured I somehow miscounted and forgot to fill the rest of the week. I looked in the cabinet for the bottle to get some more but it was empty.\\n\\nHere\\'s my excuse: I had been on and off Prednisone so many times in the past three months, I was just used to taking every day. Now, what I *should* have done at that point was call my doctor and tell him what happened. He could have prescribed me another week or so at a lower dosage and I could have tapered like I normally do, albeit, just a bit longer. But I thought to myself, *\"It\\'s no big deal. I\\'ve taken it dozens of times and never had any problems.\"* Little did I know.\\n\\nBy Thursday afternoon I was feeling unusually fatigued, like *\"I hope I\\'m not getting the flu\"* fatigued. I had a headache and slight chills. My first thought was that my lingering cough might be turning into walking pneumonia, something that\\'s happened before. But I also knew that I had been getting terrible sleep because of my cough, so maybe it was just that.\\n\\nFriday I was worse. It was my day off, and I stayed home with our toddler while my wife went to work for the morning. I let him sit on the couch and watch *Blippi* while I just laid there. That evening I spiked a fever of 102 and just felt awful. I was fearful it was either pneumonia or I had gotten the flu. It was at that moment I remembered not tapering. I Googled *\"Prednisone withdrawal symptoms\"* and, bingo, there it was. Everything I was experiencing being described by others. \\n\\nIt got worse. I would spike fevers randomly and shiver. I had night sweats and barely had any appetite at all. I ached all over, got diarrhea, dizziness, my eyes burned, I had severe fatigue. Monday morning I immediately went in to see the doctor. She tested me for flu - negative. They did an x-ray - clear. Blood test showed no infection. She agreed that what I was dealing with was almost certainly from stopping Prednisone abruptly.\\n\\nFast forward to today and this is the first day I\\'ve felt a little bit normal in a week. I\\'d say that I\\'m about 70% now, but that\\'s huge progress. I had a  chill just once today but it didn\\'t last, and I finally had some energy and appetite back. But still it\\'s 10:45 in the evening here as I write this and I\\'m definitely completely wiped out. \\n\\nThe moral of the story is this my fellow asthmatics, **don\\'t stop Prednisone suddenly!** Like I said, I\\'ve taken it dozens of times over my lifetime and never had a problem. I though *\"I got this.\"* Trust me, unless you want to feel miserable for a week (or possibly longer), **don\\'t stop it suddenly and** **don\\'t skip the taper.** If you forget about the taper, contact your doctor immediately! If you\\'ve been on Prednisone for a while, you\\'re sick and tired of the jitters and weight gain, and your tempted to just stop, DON\\'T! Again, contact your doctor for advice.

We were playing at the park and then within 15 minutes loses her voice and develops a cough. We assumed she got a weird cold as she had been playing in the river and it was quite cold. The next day she had really heavy labored breathing. When they checked her oxygen level it was at 87-88. She wouldn’t take a breathing treatment (she has level 1 austim ) due to the noise of the nebulizer scaring. Her oxygen at the point was 87-89 the screaming during her melt down pushed it to 94. They gave her a steroid shot and amoxicillin as they thought it might bacterial pneumonia. She got better the next day and her oxygen was normal and her lungs sounded fine. They gave an albuterol inhaler and told to try and use if we can. She want having it but still got better fast.  \\n\\nJump to November and she had a similar episode but way less sever and we didn’t take her to the doctor. She had a low grade fever and a cough, but again wasn’t anything we felt we needed to worry about and it went away in about a day. \\n\\nThen in January she had an episode. She had a runny nose and congestion, no fever (which tripped us up), gnarly cough, and labored breathing. Oxygen was around 91-92. Her chest wasn’t clinging to her ribs but she working to breath.

They gave us an oral steroid and thankfully my wife and I were able to convince my daughter to try the nebulizer with a mask.

She coughs when she runs around but nothing huge or intervention worthy but we tell her to slow down and we get her some water. Where she has daycare there are dogs but that doesn’t trigger anything. The weather shifted quite a bit and it went from 65 to lows teens in a day so we think maybe a cold or Allergies got her this week or something. \\n\\nI’m looking for some advice. We are getting an appointment with a doc to set a plan, but I want to know what others are doing. She’s not at a point where I think she’d take an inhaler, but don’t know.

My son, on the other hand, spends several nights in hell, with complete congestion, sore throat, and a cough that is sometimes productive, sometimes dry. The days are fine; he is up and about and moving, But at night, he gets little sleep. \\n\\nI'm up with him right now at 4am. He's completely lucid and his SO2 is 99%.

(I know these are antihistamines, but at the first sign of symptoms, it's not always clear whether this is a virus or case of allergies. He got a scratch test from an allergist last year; the \\\\~60 allergens were all negative. \\n* Guaifenesin+Dextromethorphan. \\n* Ibuprofen\\n* Oxymetazoline. I never use this more than three nights in a row, and I only use it at night. But when he's congested, it's the only thing that works.\\n* Flonase\\n* Steam showers\\n* A spoonful of honey, and/or honey tea\\n* Throat lollipops\\n* Saline nasal spray\\n* A convoluted configuration of pillows to help keep up somewhat upright in bed\\n\\nAll of these feel like symptom management. Sometimes certain tools are better than others. In these moments, my ability to approach this scientifically goes out the window and I just throw the kitchen sink at the problem, hoping that something will make him feel better. \\n\\nI'm looking for advice. Why does it take his immune system so long to calm down from these colds? Are they related to his asthma or not?

Doctors are useless in that respect and have no idea what to suggest, other than a standard inhaler, which makes this problem worse for me.  \\n\\nProblem is: I have a muscle disease.

My body compensates by adjusting heart rate and breathing, but there's a maximum that seems possible. On longer runs, this might result in mild hyperventilation, and related loss of potassium and magnesium. Followed by a mild EIB flareup some 2 hours after the run. If I use an inhaler before running then my heartrate gets messed up and running is less smooth to start with. And I inhale more oxygen, but still don't get more oxygen into my leg muscles, and hence need to keep breathing rate up in order to run. So I totally hyperventilate. And totally lose Mg and K and get a big EIB flareup. Btw, Salbutamol can also cause reduction in both electrolytes. So taking it might make things worse in several aspects.

They left me in severe pain, low energy, and seeking medical attention till this day. Everyday ended up being a struggle to breathe. People like myself have asthma triggered by being indoors with dogs. Many people don’t understand allergens (i.e. dead skin/dander) can fill an indoor space like odor or viruses. It’s been painful and at times life threatening. I just don’t know what to do anymore now that pets are common at workplaces, ride-shares, restaurants, planes, and hotels. I’m always worried about my safety and if this will lead to my death. Under the American Disability Act, I tried contacting workplaces, restaurants, and airports but it often leads to being ignored or nothing significant. Many places historically did not allow pets but now they are allowed and an entire group of people are excluded or harmed. I could really use your help on sharing this information and getting any ideas on building some awareness for people like us to feel safe again?\\n\\nI often find myself crying my way to sleep. My body hurts. Life outside is hard. I don't know what to do anymore as this gets worst.\\n\\n**My Story**\\n\\nLike an odor can fill up a floor, dogs can spread their allergens throughout an entire space. I would breathe it in and have an asthma attack. Asthma can be life threatening, counts as a disability when occurring, and is protected by the American Disability Act, but I’m finding fewer and fewer companies caring about people with pet allergies.\\n\\nWithout knowing there were dogs, I started working at Pinterest. On my first day, I had an asthma attack. I alerted my manager, HR, and then ultimately the CEO. I met others who were struggling with severe symptoms. With several Pinterest offices in the area, I asked if they could make our building with the dog free floor completely dog free given many of the allergic employees were in the same building in order to do their jobs with their teams. I also told them that there were daily sightings of dogs on an assigned dog free floor and even if there weren’t, the floor itself does not work because there’s a giant staircase through each floor spreading air with allergens in it. They didn’t budge.\\n\\nWe had to tolerate symptoms and were sick for weeks at a time. I medicated with the support of a doctor and had severe asthma attacks throughout the experience.\\n\\nMy manager and HR said I can work from home but there was constant pressure from my manager to get me to show up in person at the office.The environment included people asking to fire me and making jokes about people with dog allergies on Slack. I was also afraid of being found out when people ask me why I'm calling into meetings. My management chain kept suggesting it would be good for me to be in the office.\\n\\nOver many months, the company often said they care about my safety and verbally committed to items in regards to the dog allergens at work and my health but often failed to deliver on them, such as: air filters, adjusting work conditions, workload adjustments, lobby policies, responding to emails promptly. They experimented with signs that said no dogs on the dog free floor that employees continued to ignore. When someone posted on Blind about the health issue with allergies and asthma, employees commented saying people like me should not work here or be fired. All this time, I was heavily medicated and had a massive amount of chest pains and difficulty breathing everyday. My health was getting worse.\\n\\nI tried finding another company but I was not in any shape to do well in an interview. I kept getting allergy shots in hopes they helped but they’re not a cure. Work was very demanding. When I looked at other companies (i.e. Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, Asana, Workday, startups), many of them already had a dog friendly policy. Recruiters would not follow up when I told them that I’m allergic to dogs. It’s very hard to find opportunities to work in a safe work environment.\\n\\nI was explicitly begging for my life and saying I’m afraid of dying to my manager and HR. Finally, a senior leader who has been trying to help because his team had someone who was also getting very sick told me that they’re removing the dog policy because there were many cases of dogs in the dining area where the health department brought it up as an issue. It just really made me feel like my life was so expendable. Free food beat out dogs at work, but nearly killing us did not.\\n\\nDue to the many months of exposure, I continued to have health issues after the dogs were removed. I barely slept, as I’d have severe daily chest pains at night. I’ve been working with doctors ever since to try to relieve my pain and to breathe normally again. I’ve lost years of my life to this now due to the incident and the symptoms that have followed me since. I’ve spent so much time laying in bed wishing for the pain to stop and questioning if it would have been better if the incident had just succeeded in taking my life.\\n\\nI brought up my manager’s behavior with the company where he was not following up on reasonable accommodation items that he said he would. He even said I would \\\\[f-word\\\\] this new task up while referring to how my asthma made his life harder. The company performed an investigation on this where he got feedback then promoted a month later. It did not matter if I continued to have asthma attacks. As long as the company was trying something like talking about doing something, they were accommodating. It’s been rough from so many angles.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, people love dogs. I don’t really know what to do. I see dogs in restaurants, bars, planes, workplaces, and hotels now. I feel people like me are doomed to not have less access to many places in the future. I’m still overwhelmed from seeing physicians in hopes of being able to breathe, sleep, and feel safe again one day. I see others are struggling with this too, but I just don’t know what to do. I feel so weak and low on energy from my experience at Pinterest.\\n\\nAlso people often focused the conversation to service dogs but the vast majority of allergens at work were from pet dogs, not service dogs. I believe people who are allergic to dogs and those in need of a service dog can figure out a way to not impact each other. I’ve also heard many service dog owners prefer their dog to not be around non-trained dogs due to how they might react.\\n\\n**Articles on other people's experience and even having an attack on planes**\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1116418872519929859](https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1116418872519929859)\\n\\n[https://www.askamanager.org/2015/07/my-new-office-is-full-of-dogs-and-im-allergic.html](https://www.askamanager.org/2015/07/my-new-office-is-full-of-dogs-and-im-allergic.html)\\n\\n[https://www.fastcompany.com/3049578/help-my-new-office-is-full-of-dogs-and-im-allergic](https://www.fastcompany.com/3049578/help-my-new-office-is-full-of-dogs-and-im-allergic)\\n\\n[https://abc7news.com/support-animals-on-airplanes-airline-guidelines-for-pets-are-dogs-allowed-planes-flight-delays-oakland-airport/5803216/](https://abc7news.com/support-animals-on-airplanes-airline-guidelines-for-pets-are-dogs-allowed-planes-flight-delays-oakland-airport/5803216/)\",\n 'Has anyone here been prescribed a Trimbow 3-1 inhaler for asthma, I’ve read it’s used more for copd but I’ve only got asthma , does anyone know I’d it’s safe and effective',\n 'I started working in a sales call centre over a month ago.

Looking for advice on whether I should take them or not',\n \"Hi folks, I am thankfully in normal care now after rushed visit to ER last night and I thought I might recount my experience here in case it might be relevant to anyone in this sub, and get your advice.\\n\\nI am a relatively healthy 31 yo with a history of mild asthma, without any prior hospitalization in my life. I only needed to take preventative inhaler (flixotide) and rarely Ventolin (at home) some years back, and have gone without any sthma medication the past 2 years without any asthma attacks.\\n\\nAlways thought I was good, until last Thursday night, when I got an asthma attack out of nowhere. I rushed to get Ventolin and afterwards it was better, but I needed to take like 10 puffs in the next 22 hours so I went to meet a doctor immediately Friday night and received some extra medication for better control (symbicort and medrol). Doctor said this was enough to remove the attacks, and I should just re-visit after 7-14 days if any issues/for monitoring.\\n\\nThe prescribed medication did not improve my condition in the next 3-4 days and I still needed to take 6-8 puffs of Ventolin per day on top of that. I thought I should just keep using Ventolin while waiting for this new prescription to take effects. (I checked online and 8 puffs of Ventolin per day is still within the range the body can take). But then Tuesday afternoon, I had another attack, used Ventolin, and this time there is something different, I felt my legs (and later my hands) started to feel very shaky and I hear my heart pounding. This was not normal, nothing like this had never happened to me before. I called a cab to the nearest hospital.\\n\\nThis was the worst cab ride in my life, I thought I'd die on the taxi. It was quickly getting harder and harder to breathe and I kept on getting a new puff from my ventolin every minute during the whole ride, panicking, and I felt nothing in my feet and started to lose control in my hands too. I stupidly thought I was losing oxygen to survive and the limbs are gone first. I focused all my strength on my fingers in order to push down on the Ventolin, and felt the strength fading as I gradually could only insert force on one finger, my middle finger to push on my inhaler, then afterwards this little force faded too, I dropped my inhaler and felt paralyzed. No feelings in my hand and I saw my fingers curled strangely but not due to my move, like watching someone's hand. Horrible thoughts rushed through my head when we arrived in the hospital. As I could not move they had to drag me out of the taxi and carry me to ER. My mind was fully conscious, I think, and I kept on going over in my head the word asthma, my name, address, to ensure I could tell them the important info.\\n\\nThey proceeded to put a lot of things on me, something to breathe in, Na+, got my blood test, after 1-2 hrs I gradually breathed better and sensory came back to my hand and feet. But I was very weak, shaky, and not felt like myself. They took my chest x-ray with me lying down. Late in the evening, the doctor said to me something about low potassium in blood, which I recalled reading somewhere before that it was a side effect of the inhalers...\\n\\nNow I am feeling much better, getting a lot of antibiotic, kali clorid pills, and aerosol spray twice today, still having some episodes of feeling hard to breathe but at least I am inside the hospital and feel safer about getting help soon enough when I need it. \\n\\nI am still confused why my potassium level in blood is so low. My blood test taken 1 hour after admission later read 2.7 mmol/L. I don't know if the level was low from before and the inhaler escalated the drop of potassium in blood I just had a regular health check 2 weeks ago which came out great including kidney function, so I assume everything was fine and this situation is 100% due to the asthma medications I have taken the last 3-4 days, including my 20 puffs in the taxi. Did I almost kill myself? I am still afraid now that I will get another attack and be gone. The doctor said I am also under some anxiety attack and that my asthma is better now with their treatment, but I do not feel it is working as fast as I would like. I am not back to who I was and the strength I had just one week ago. Slight movements now made me short for breaths. During those times I can't talk to my mom, only type. I don't know what is the trigger for these attack. They also tested covid and I am negative.\\n\\nDo any folks here have experience with fast way to recover from low potassium in blood?  Did anyone experience asthma attacks that your doctors say come from your anxiety? How do you deal with it? I am just afraid that if I get through this, I will be scarred in my mind for a long time and unable to go on any trips, hike any mountains, do anything that keep me far from a hospital ER.\",\n \"So I have pretty bad asthma, at least once a month id need my nebulizer up until I was a teen, then against advice id take my generic Ventolin inhaler like 8 times a day.

It has happened, early in the morning and once a severe coughing fit at a friend\\'s house. We were drinking and gaming and he\\'s a young guy who lives alone.

It only makes them worse if they\\'re ongoing at the same time. \\n\\n\\nI feel very lost since it feels like all doctors I talk to only want to put me on something sedating like valium to prove it\\'s anxiety.

Incase this, or something similar, happens again what do you individuals do when you forget your inhaler?',\n \"Hey everyone. I (F18) used to have pretty bad asthma as a child and ended up taking montelukast (singular) for a year or two when I was about 8-10 ish. I believe this was before they knew it was a neuropsychiatric, since my mom herself is a nurse practitioner, and I highly doubt she would have had me taking it for my asthma (which wasn't severe enough to call for that sort of thing).\\n\\nAnyways, a bit into taking singulair I developed onset tics. Since this wasn't extremely unseen in children my age we didn't think too much of it. They eventually got quite severe, which led us to trial and error taking out certain medicine I was taking. Eventually, we found out it was the singulair that was causing the issues and immediately stopped taking it.\\n\\nThis stopped the tics and everything seemed to be quite normal for a long time. It wasn't until late middle school that I realized my tics could still be triggered by other people with tics. I didn't remember much of the original onset since I was quite young at the time, so I didn't make the connection nor tell anyone about the triggered tics.\\n\\nAbout a month or so into covid, my tics started redeveloping and I didn't understand what could have possibly caused it so late into my life. When tics/Tourettes develop, it's often as a child. I started doing research into montelukast and found all of the new research regarding its neurological side effects. I am genuinely so upset writing this post right now (sobbing in my dorm room) because I'm reading all of these studies focused on the damage this medicine has caused. I honestly believe my brain chemistry was altered as a child, maybe even causing mononeuropathy (which could have likely caused the persistence of tics).   \\n\\n\\nSince I'm in my first year at university (having moved countries) and having lost my primary care, I am practically in the dark when it comes to seeing someone about this. What I need right now is support.  \\n\\n\\nSo with this, I ask; is there anyone else who has gone through this? I feel so alone.\",\n \"Yea. Idk what to do.

The most common triggers are cat dander, ragweed, and cold air. When I was a kid, it was also exercise induced. As an adult, it’s never really been a problem.

Cats… I could cough it away after leaving the cats’ house.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFast forward to 2021. Survived COVID in August with the help of an albuterol inhaler. Things were fine. In November we acquired a canary. By December I felt like I had bronchitis, went to urgent care, was told I had a sinus infection. They put me on antibiotics. 5 days later I returned and was told I had pneumonia. 3 weeks later after multiple rounds of nebulizers, inhalers, and antibiotics, I returned to urgent care, yet again, with breathing problems. After an x-ray they determined that I no longer had pneumonia but was having asthma attacks or bronchitis. We determined that the trigger could have been the canary. We rehomed him the next day. That was a month ago (Jan 15th). On the 19th, my breathing was so bad that I thought about going to the ER. My better half cleaned the downstairs to help with the canary dander and I felt an improvement the next day, while still taking nebulizers. By the 30th I felt well enough to finally take down the Christmas decorations. At the same time, my daughter came over to do another “deep cleaning” and get anything her mother may have missed.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBegin another downward spiral. Thankfully on February 7th, I was able to get in to see an allergist. He said I was “this close” to needing to go to the ER. I told him the story, and he said he wanted to stop the cycle. He gave me antibiotics, prednisone, nebulizer, albuterol, and Symbicort. He said if things stay calm, I might be able to come off the Symbicort in 6 months, and in 3 months, wants me back for an allergy test. (It’ll be at least my 3rd one. I test positive for almost everything they scratch me with.) It’s been a week since I saw the allergist. The antibiotics are gone, and I have 5 days left of the prednisone taper.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI’ve never had an attack like this before, as I mentioned in the beginning. Saturday, I fell asleep early. Sunday, we did a bit of walking, and I ended up napping in the afternoon, which is unusual for me. I feel like the walking upset my lungs, and I started taking the nebulizer more again. Just how long does this exhaustion last? Also, we’ve read that some people who recover from COVID end up with asthma flare-ups. The allergist says he’s not sure the canary was the cause. The Mrs. opined that she thinks that before having COVID the canary might not have set off the asthma. Can it be that once the lungs are agitated, they are more easily irritated until things settle down? I’m not sure how this all works.',\n '&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o9ho5etbcxh81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af8c7f5a98b84797c47291f52041a885ea3787a',\n \"Hi everyone - I've had asthma for 20+ years, usually quite well managed.

My family has a history of asthma and reactive airway diseases, so I guess now is my turn to get the disease. Here's how I developed it:\\n\\nLet's take it back to August 27th, 2021. I wake up after a night out as normal, go about my usual day in my last semester of college. Feel great. All of a sudden, I noticed a tightness on my chest, a feeling of having to take a deep breath to make sure I'm breathing, and felt a lump in my throat. Wasn't sure what it was, but was afraid to go the hospital. Thought I was having a heart attack. But I remembered that I had felt this before a couple of times, usually in a milder form. So, I thought it would go away as the day went on. \\n\\nFlash forward to about 10 days later, I'm in the hospital. Breathing is almost impossible, and I'm scared as all hell. Doctors assess me. Heart is normal, lungs are clear. The ER doctor determines I have acid reflux and give me famotidine and an inhaler to relieve the symptoms, then send me home. \\n\\nThe shortness of breath remains and I get that lump in my throat feeling often. The chest tightness is much less severe but does have it's moments where it comes and goes. This goes on from September until October 2021. I think nothing of it and assume it's just the reflux still happening. Maybe I have GERD now? I should just follow the meds I've been given and go see my doctor. \\n\\nI talk to my doctor on October 5th, 2021. He says it was acid reflux that caused me to have an asthmatic reaction. I feel sort of relieved because he did acknowledge that I do have some sort of asthmatic reaction to stomach acid overproduction. After our talk, I keep taking the famotidine and lay off the inhaler because I think I don't need it. But, the shortness of breath and throat lump remain. The shortness of breath is constant, but the lump comes and goes. This continues for 3 months until January. \\n\\nIt's January, and I stop taking famotidine because it made me dizzy during the day. Turns out my stomach didn't need it after all. The shortness of breath STILL remained, and was especially bad when I exercised. I mostly do strength lifting, so I'm working with heavy weights for sets of 5 at a time, so having shortness of breath during these lifts made me feel scared like something was wrong. I begin taking my rescue inhaler 2x a day. Once before exercise and once before bed. I begin to wonder if it ever really was acid reflux, and not something else...\\n\\nFinally, today I determined that my symptoms are coming from allergic asthma. I made appointments with a pulmonologist and my doctor to have this confirmed and I have some good evidence to provide for them that what I'm experiencing is, in fact, allergic asthma. Beyond my family history. \\n\\nMy triggers are as follows from severe to mild: beer, wine, and dark liquor (from sulfites), dogs, dust, pollen, rubber, cats, and chlorine (work at an indoor pool). This is just from what I've noticed.\\n\\nMy family has a history of asthma and reactive airway diseases, like I said before. I've never had a problem with symptoms of those diseases in my entire life, up until now. I suppose it's just my genetics saying that it's my turn to experience them.\\n\\nSo that's my story. TL;DR I went to the hospital for what was thought to be bad acid reflux but has since turned out to be allergic asthma from the exhibited symptoms. \\n\\nI'm just glad to read some of the posts on here and not feel alone. Turns out it's more common than I think. Hell, some of my best friends have it too now that I think about it. I'll feel a lot better once I see a pulmonologist and doctor and get properly evaluated and medicated.

It's never been more than some wheezing when I try to run so I can live with it, I just really want to do more intense exercise.

I was smoking all of these heavily at the age of 16 till now. I remember years ago I would have bad breathing reactions to certain carts and vapes. I had asthma as a child but it disappeared. Anyways, would start to feel a heavy sensation on my left side of my chest at around 18 but thought nothing of it kept vaping, would stop for a couple months from a scare and then continue when symptoms were gone which was very stupid of me. Also have been to the ER multiple times due to peanut allergy. Smoking weed and vaping would make my left side of the chest to feel inflamed and tight, as well as heavy. Now this year is the worst year for me because I was exposed to a lot of sawdust while using an angle grinder in sculpture class without wearing proper protection. After this day my lungs felt so inflamed and a stinging sensation that caused me to visit the ER three days later. They put me on a nebulizer and some medication and I got better, stupid enough to start vaping. I would begin cackling up mucus like clearing my throat with a lot of mucus from the sawdust incident and vaping. Now I have stopped smoking all together and my doctor said I have asthma but never gave me a pulmonary test, put me on wixella and albuterol. Whenever I get a flare up even 10 puffs of albuterol doesn\\'t work. I now get the random left side chest pains a lot. I also take GERD medication that doesn\\'t help. Now three days days ago I contracted covid, had a fever one day, the next day had a really really bad exacerbation episode that led me to the ER. Left side still stung and hurt. Now its been three days and my lungs feel like how they did from the sawdust, just messed up, heavy. Hard to catch a breath. Lungs feel hard and different, cough feels really crunchy and hard and it clears out mucus, but I\\'m not really coughing I\\'m clearing my throat. Nebulizer doesn\\'t really work. I feel bubbling sometimes and can also feel my lung throbbing sometimes. I have the cackling clearing of mucus sometimes as well. I really hope I can heal from this and I regret my smoking history so much. I am an aspiring artist at school and have always been so excited for my future.

I was wondering if anyone has been positive to omicron and had different symptoms like a wet cough vs a dry cough. \\n\\nSo, I have allergic asthma very much under control (so much so that I haven’t used my inhaler in forever) and seasonal allergies which cause rhinitis. \\n\\nI was on immunotherapy for 5 years and my rhinitis episodes basically went away. Well, severe ones anyway. \\n\\nBut here’s the thing, I’m having what I call a severe allergic episode and it all starts with rhinitis: runny/itchy nose (super watery), constant sneezing, watery eyes, congestion, headache (because rhinosinusitis), itchy ears and general malaise. (Day one)\\n\\nThen I get a scratchy throat and it hurts when I swallow.\\n\\nCongestion continues and no more sneezing nor runny nose but still some mucus discharge and mostly post nasal. No more scratchy throat but still some discomfort. A feeling of tightness in the chest, no difficulty breathing and a mostly dry cough. \\n\\nAfter that, cough turns wet, and I start wheezing when I breathe until I cough and clear/swallow sputum. \\n\\nFinally crackling when I breath on top of the wheezing and wet cough.  \\n\\nI never develop a fever so my treatment consists on antihistamines, ibuprofen and a nasal spray. If the wheezing and crackling is bad then I get an inhaler. In the past I’ve needed a nebulizer but since the allergies and asthma have been under control I haven’t had the need for one in a long time thankfully.\\n\\nSo far the progression this time has been faster, I’m on day 3 and the wheezing has already started and I’ve been concerned about omicron because the symptoms are similar to those of an allergic episode. Except for the wet cough and wheezing but I’m wondering if asthmatics experience these or not. \\n\\nI’ve taken the necessary precautions in case it could be COVID but I don’t want to go get tested and expose myself to actual sick people. \\n\\nI’m 99% sure this is an allergy thing because I did something stupid: worked up a sweat walking/playing with my brother’s dog (to whom I’m mildly allergic), came home, undressed and turned on the ceiling fan to dry out until I got super cold. That night I started with the sneezing an itchy nose/ears. I’ve also haven’t been in close contact with anyone except mom and brother and we’re all vaccinated. \\n\\nNeither my mom nor my brother have developed any symptoms. \\n\\nTLDR; I did something stupid and got “sick”, I’m pretty sure it’s allergies but I’m concerned about omicron.',\n 'Hi everyone.

My experience of tapering down dosages gradually is that there is an exacerbation/flare up immediately following the dose reduction, which will eventually die down after a few days/weeks.

It 's well known that topical steroids create a dependency and withdrawal flare ups and it seems highly plausible to me that inhaled steroids might create the same issues.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nI've experimented on myself somewhat. Over the course of a year I have dropped my Beclomethasone dosage from \\\\*2000mcg per day all the way down to 250mcg per day. That's an almost\\xa0 90% reduction by gradually tapering. The flare ups after each taper are uncomfortable but manageable. I would only ever taper down roughly 100/50mcg less each time across a days dosing, so 1000mcg to 900mcg for example and then stay at that level until the exacerbation stabilised for a number of weeks before dropping again. I wouldn't say it's easy, trying to continue on the experiment during the initial flare ups isn't fun and the temptation to just maintain at the level and not drop is constantly present. But I'm very pleased with my results.

To be more percise, I'd like to know what good Asthma control actually means.\\n\\nI got diagnosed with Asthma last summer and have been on a preventer (Fostair) and a reliever (Salbutamol) since. Reliever use decreased significantly after the Fostair really took effect (after about a month) and my Asthma has been pretty well controled so far. \\nExcept for one major exacerbation recently. \\nI was just getting ready for bed, I had been watching a movie and munching tortillas until quite late at night (I think it was around 11 p. m.) I noticed a slight wheeze. I ignored it at first, because a tiny bit of a wheeze is quite common for me and most of the time goes away on its own.\\nIt didn't that time, so I took my Salbutamol (the regular two puffs) and waited a few minutes. \\nThe chest tightness and wheezing did not disappear, even got worse. So I took another two puffs of Salbutamol and waited. Things however, still progressed and I took another four puffs of my Salbutamol. At that point I was relly scared and thought about calling 911. After my reliever still not working I took four puffs of Combivent (Ipratroprium Bromide + Fenoterol) I had lying around, which finally ended the Attack. Of course I was shaking massively and I could not sleep for the rest of the night. \\n\\nSo back to my question. From what I have read this single incident would mean bad asthma control and the need for a change in my treatment. Is that true?\\n\\nAlso should I have called an ambulance? I was thinking about that and just barely got the attack under control before doing so. But when is the point I should call for help and how do I know I am at that point?\\n\\nObviously I know I should talk to my pulmonologist, which I will do, however my next appointment (due to the pandemic) isn't until February.\",\n 'I got my first dose of Pfizer today, and I feel like my chest is a bit congested.

After that, I started showing symptoms similar to the ones of Allergic Asthma whenever I got exposed to cigarette smoke, and they seemed to have gotten worse and worse. \\n\\nNow, I can detect a smell of cigarettes faster than anyone, even if the smoker is really far away, and once I get exposed to it, symptoms usually kick in a day later, starting with sleepiness, and then asthmatic symptoms.

This happened once a year until 2020, always a clear irritant. Then I had my first 1.5 mile run after not running in a while in 2020 on a cool day, and had exercise-induced asthma for the first time. Got serious about things and started using a controller like it was my new religion: went from QVar (not much effect) to Symbicort (decent improvement, but not as good as my doctor or I hoped, and the formoterol side effects were not missed) and finally Trelegy Ellipta (200), which I've been on for most of 2021 that finally got me symptom free. Not quite top marks on a PFT, and I wouldn't care to go running on a winter day, but I was even able to exercise vigorously again without issue. It was working so well that my doc and I were in talks about 10 days ago about tapering down.\\n\\nThen it happened: cheat tightness last Monday. It doesn't go away. Sometimes it's higher, sometimes its lower, sometimes it seems there's a bit of phlegm, sometimes dry and burning. Albuterol only helps a small amount. My home PEF/FEV1 meter show pretty much the same results I had even when I was symptom free. No fever, no cough, no wheezing, and indoor exercise doesn't make it worse. It was also 3 or 4 days after my COVID booster.\\n\\nMy PCP and Pulmonogist said not to worry about it given as I've been describing it, use thr Albuterol, and give it some time to go away by itself.
