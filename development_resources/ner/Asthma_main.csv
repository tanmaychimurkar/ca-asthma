Question,Context,Label
What are common asthma treatments?,The most common asthma treatments are inhalers. These are considered the best asthma treatments for most people. This is because inhalers help get the medicine to the airways where it’s needed. Almost everyone with asthma has a preventer inhaler and a reliever inhaler.,
Are inhalers useful to asthma patients?,"Almost everyone with asthma has a preventer inhaler and a reliever inhaler. Everyone with asthma can benefit from a preventer inhaler.
Preventer inhalers prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways. This means you’re less likely to get symptoms if you come across your asthma triggers. 
Regular preventer medicine helps prevent asthma attacks. Reliever inhalers relieve asthma symptoms like coughing, wheezing, breathlessness, and a tight chest. You use your reliever inhaler just when you have symptoms or an asthma attack.
If your asthma is well controlled, you shouldn’t need to use your reliever inhaler often - or at all. But remember to always carry it with you in case symptoms do flare up. A small number of people who have mild symptoms very infrequently may only need a reliever inhaler to use when they get symptoms. However, some studies suggest that everyone should have a preventer inhaler too, to lower their risk of asthma attacks.",
When should I go to see a doctor?,"If you're using your reliever inhaler three or more times a week, see your GP or asthma nurse as soon as possible to review your treatment plan. If you've only been prescribed a reliever inhaler, see your GP or asthma nurse urgently to ask for a preventer inhaler too.",
When may I need preventer inhaler?,You need a preventer inhaler if you've noticed symptoms three or more times a week or you wake up at night with symptoms or you've had an asthma attack in the last two years.,
Can you tell me something about additional treatments?,"As a kind of add-on treatment, a long-acting bronchodilator opens up your airways. It contains reliever medicines that last 12 hours. It can lower your risk of asthma attacks. You must continue to take your preventer inhaler as prescribed because long-acting bronchodilators cannot deal with the inflammation in your airways. Your GP may prescribe a long-acting bronchodilator in a combination inhaler. This is one inhaler containing both the long-acting bronchodilator and your preventer medicine. You'll need your usual blue reliever inhaler too, in case you get symptoms. A certain type of long-acting bronchodilator medicine, found in MART inhalers (Maintenance and reliever therapy), can give quick relief for asthma symptoms too. This means you can use your MART inhaler as an emergency reliever as well. But not all combination inhalers can be used as a reliever so check with your GP. Make sure your GP or asthma nurse explains what your long-acting bronchodilator can and cannot do.",
Can you tell me something about add-on treatments?,"As a kind of add-on treatment, montelukast is a preventer tablet. It is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA). This kind of medicine helps with the inflammation in your airways. Unlike your preventer inhaler, montelukast does not contain steroids. You need to take it alongside your regular steroid preventer inhaler.",
Can you tell me something about extra treatments?,"As a kind of add-on treatment, Your GP may prescribe you oral steroids (usually prednisolone) in addition to your usual asthma medicines. Steroids help you get symptoms under control in the short term, or if you’ve had an asthma attack, by reducing the inflammation in your airways. If you frequently need oral steroids, or you need to take them long-term, you should be referred to an asthma specialist to look at other ways to manage your asthma.",
When should I call for an ambulance? When should I go to hospital?,"Call 144 for an ambulance if you're having an asthma attack and your symptoms do not improve after ten puffs, 30-60 seconds apart, of your reliever inhaler, or if you feel worse at any point.",
What I can do with an asthma attack?,"If you do have an asthma attack, the first line of treatment is your blue reliever inhaler. This can quickly get symptoms under control. If you need to be treated in hospital for an asthma attack, you’ll be treated with higher doses of reliever medicine. Sometimes this will be given through a nebuliser. You’ll also be given oxygen. You’ll need to take a course of steroid tablets as part of your recovery plan. See your GP for a follow up after being discharged from hospital. They can make sure you’re making a good recovery, and that you’re not at risk from another attack. Remember: taking your preventer medicine every day is the best way to prevent symptoms from building up into an asthma attack.",
Can I know about about the asthma from you?,"If you have any concerns about the treatments you’ve been prescribed you can speak to a respiratory nurse specialist on our Helpline by calling 0300 222 5800, Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm. Or you can WhatsApp them on 07378 606728.",
Which medicine can control my asthma?,"You will probably take more medicine when you begin treatment to get control of your asthma. Work with your doctor to learn which medicine(s) control your asthma best and how much you need. Once your asthma is well-controlled, your doctor may be able to reduce the amount of medicine you take. The goal is to gain control of your asthma as soon as possible and then control it with as little medicine as possible. Once long-term anti-inflammatory therapy begins, your doctor should monitor you every one to six months. This is to see how your asthma medicines are working and if your asthma is well controlled.",
How I can avoid asthma trigger?,"Many people wake up with asthma symptoms such as coughing or wheezing. You can control nighttime symptoms by taking asthma medicines as directed by your doctor. Removing triggers where you sleep may help you sleep better. Many people are allergic to dust mites and mold found in bedding materials. Using mattress or pillow encasements can help contain those allergens. Dehumidifiers can also be helpful to reduce the humidity in your home that dust mites and mold need to exist. Using air cleaners in your bedroom may also help reduce your exposure to allergens and irritants (animal dander, dust mites, air pollution, etc.).",
What should I do before I work out?,"Exercising, particularly in cold air, may cause airway swelling or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Quick-relief asthma medicines, taken before exercise, usually control this. If you need repeated doses of quick-relief medicine during and after exercise talk with your doctor. Your medicines may need to be adjusted. Thanks to these medicines, many Olympic and professional athletes have successful sports careers even with their asthma. It is important for everyone, including people with asthma, to be as active as possible for good health. Talk with your doctor about how you can be physically active while keeping your asthma well-controlled.",
What should I do if I feel uncomfortable after taking the pills?,All medicines have side effects. Tell your doctor how you are responding to the treatment and if you have any side effects. Follow up often with your doctor so you can control your asthma with the least amount of medicines and with the fewest side effects.,
What I can do if reliever and preventer inhalers can't help?,"If using reliever and preventer inhalers does not control your asthma, you may need an inhaler that combines both. Combination inhalers are used every day to help stop symptoms occurring and provide long-lasting relief if they do occur. It's important to use it regularly, even if you do not have symptoms. Side effects of combination inhalers are similar to those of reliever and preventer inhalers.",
What's the treatment to deal with severe asthma?,"A procedure called bronchial thermoplasty may be offered as a treatment for severe asthma. It works well and there are no serious concerns about its safety. You will be sedated or put to sleep using a general anaesthetic during a bronchial thermoplasty. It involves passing a thin, flexible tube down your throat and into your lungs. Heat is then used on the muscles around the airways to help stop them narrowing and causing asthma symptoms.",
It seems I got work-related asthma. What should I do now?,"If you seem to have occupational asthma, where your asthma is linked to your job, you'll be referred to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis. If your employer has an occupational health service, they should also be informed, along with your health and safety officer. Your employer has a responsibility to protect you from the causes of occupational asthma.",
When should I see a doctor?,"If you’re using rescue inhalers (or quick-relief inhalers) more than 2 days a week, see your doctor. ",
Are there some long-term control medicines very effective?,"Inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective long-term control medicines. These aren’t the same as anabolic steroids that people use to grow muscle. They include beclomethasone (Qvar RediHaler), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), ciclesonide (Alvesco), fluticasone (Flovent HFA), and mometasone (Asmanex Twisthaler).",
,"Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists open your airways by relaxing the smooth muscles around them. You’ll take this medication along with an inhaled corticosteroid. They include formoterol, salmeterol, and vilanterol.",
,"Combination inhaled medicines have an inhaled corticosteroid along with a long-acting beta-agonist. This is an easy way to take them together. They include Advair, Breo, Dulera, and Symbicort.",
,"Biologics target a cell or protein in your body to prevent airway inflammation. They may be shots or infusions you get every few weeks. They can be expensive, so you usually get them if other medications don’t work. Biologics include benralizumab (Fasenra), dupilumab (Dupixent), mepolizumab (Nucala), omalizumab (Xolair), and reslizumab (Cinqair).",
,"Leukotriene modifiers relax the smooth muscles around your airways and ease swelling. You can take them as pills or liquids. These include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and zileuton (Zyflo).",
,Cromolyn prevents your airways from swelling when they come into contact with an asthma trigger. It’s a non-steroid medicine that comes in an inhaler.,
,"Theophylline (Theo-24, Theo-Dur) relaxes the smooth muscles that narrow your airways. It comes as a tablet, capsule, solution, or syrup.",
,Tezepelumab-ekko (Tezspire) injection is a first-in-class medicine indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.,
,Long-acting bronchodilators. You might use tiotropium (Spiriva) along with corticosteroids if you have ongoing asthma symptoms even though you take a daily inhaled steroid. Never use long-acting bronchodilators alone as a long-term asthma treatment.,
,"Corticosteroids. If no other medicine can get your asthma attacks under control, your doctor might have you take these medications for a couple of weeks. They come in pills or liquids.",
,"If you’re having trouble using small inhalers, your doctor may recommend a nebulizer. This machine changes asthma medications from a liquid to a mist so it’s easier to get the medicine into your lungs. It also has a mouthpiece or mask that makes it a good option for infants, small children, older adults, or anyone who has trouble using inhalers with spacers. It takes a few more minutes to use than an inhaler.",
,"Many medications have side effects. For example, inhaled steroids can cause mild problems, such as thrush infections and a sore throat, or more serious ones including eye disorders and bone loss. Keep your doctor up to date with how well your treatment is working and whether you have side effects. They’ll work with you to keep your asthma under control with as little medicine as possible.",
,"Medications aren’t the only way to control asthma. Your doctor might also try a condition called bronchial thermoplasty. People with asthma often have extra smooth muscle in their airway walls. In this procedure, your doctor uses a small tube called a bronchoscope to send heat to the walls and reduce the smooth muscle. You’ll get the treatment over three visits about 2 or 3 weeks apart.",
,Breathing exercises. These can lower the amount of medication you need to control your symptoms.,
,"Caffeine. It’s a mild bronchodilator, meaning it can open your airways, but it doesn’t work as fast as medications. Avoid caffeine for several hours before any medical appointment that might include a lung function test.",
,"If you’ve been diagnosed with asthma but your treatment doesn’t seem to work anymore, it’s time to see your doctor again. Likewise, if you’re having to use your rescue inhaler too often, see your doctor. You may need to change your asthma treatment for better control. Though asthma is common, it’s a serious condition that needs a diagnosis and treatment. Talk to your doctor for asthma support, and find the medications that work best for you.",
,"Treatment focuses on a person keeping their chronic symptoms in check and avoiding triggers while receiving quick relief during severe flare-ups. Doctors call a flare-up of asthma symptoms an asthma attack, and the treatment they prescribe tries to limit further attacks and reduce the need for rapid medication.
Also, treatment aims to restore and maintain a person’s lung function, activity levels, and sleep patterns. As the disease has a variety of causes and people of all ages can have it, most individuals will have a different action plan and course of treatment. In this article, we explore the management options for asthma.",
,"Typically, people should attend asthma consultations every 2 to 6 weeks after first receiving a diagnosis. However, using a peak flow meter at home to monitor the progress of their treatment can help them manage the disease in between doctor’s visits. A peak flow meter is a simple, handheld tool that can help a person maintain control of their asthma by allowing them to measure the effectiveness of air movement from their lungs. The meter reveals a “peak flow” number after a person blows into the device. A doctor will indicate how often a person should use the test, how to interpret the results, and how to judge how much medication they need to take. The doctor may request that a person either records their scores every morning or uses the peak flow meter intermittently. The monitoring aims to find and maintain a “personal best”peak flow number by recording the scores for 2 to 3 weeks after diagnosis. The personal best score will dictate the dosage and delivery method of medications. By comparing future scores with the individual’s best score, a doctor can measure whether their treatment is working. Peak flow can also warn of an oncoming asthma attack before symptoms are apparent.",
,"A person is applying treatment effectively if the following apply:
1. coughing and breathlessness occurs on no more than 2 days per week
2. They need quick-relief medicines on fewer than 2 days per week
3. they are maintaining good lung function
4. their activity levels remaining normal
5. asthma symptoms are waking them from sleep on fewer than 1 to 2 nights per month
6. they do not need emergency medical treatment
7. they are experiencing one or fewer asthma attacks per year that require corticosteroid treatment
8. peak flow is staying higher than 80 percent of the personal best
Good control also means people need to be avoiding asthma triggers and allergens as well.",
,"The primary forms of quick-relief asthma medications are beta2-agonists, a class of drugs that includes:
1. metaproterenol
2. epinephrine, available in EpiPen and EpiPen Jr., Adrenalin, and Epinephrine Mist
3. albuterol, under brand names that include Ventolin HFA, Proventil, and Proair
4. levalbuterol, available as Xopenex
Most asthma medication is available in the form of a powder or mist for oral administration with an inhaler. An inhaler is a device that “mists” the medicine, promoting more efficient and direct delivery to the lungs. Asthma medicines can sometimes take the form of a pill, as well.",
,"A person with asthma should use these drugs daily to reduce flare-ups and ongoing symptoms. The most effective drugs for long-term asthma control are known as inhaled corticosteroids. These provide inflammation relief and reduce a person’s sensitivity to allergens and triggers. However, the medicines do have side effects, such as thrush that causes a fungal infection of the mouth. When corticosteroids reach the mouth or throat, the risk of thrush increases. Manufacturers of inhaler devices have developed spacers or holding chambers to help prevent thrush. Rinsing the mouth after inhalation can have a similar protective effect. Inhaled corticosteroids also increase the risk of cataracts and osteoporosis when a person takes them for a long time. Doctors may prescribe the following medicines on a long-term basis for people with asthma:
1. anti-inflammatory drugs, including cromolyn, which the person takes using a nebulizer
2. immunomodulators, including omalizumab, which a doctor will administer once or twice a month by injection to help reduce reactions to asthma triggers, such as pollen and dust mites
3. inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists, which open the airways and may feature alongside corticosteroids in the medication plan of a person with asthma
4. leukotriene modifiers for blocking the inflammation reaction in the airways
5. theophylline, an oral medication that opens the airways
People should use a quick-relief inhaler for no more than 2 days a week. Most people carry the quick-relief inhaler with them at all times and administer the medication when they first notice symptoms.
Usually, quick-relief medicines do not reduce inflammation, so a person should avoid using them for long-term control of their condition.",
,"While researchers have explored nonmedical remedies for asthma symptoms, no research is currently available to confirm the effectiveness of anything other than conventional treatment for managing asthma. Nonmedical treatments, as yet unconfirmed, include acupuncture, breathing exercises, and placebo medications. Also, complementary techniques and supplements can interact with conventional medications with potentially harmful effects. They are not a replacement for conventional, medically supervised management of asthma.",
,"If you feel fatigue, you may need to take Modafinils, Vitamin B Complex and Multivitamins.",
,"If you feel stressed, you may need to listen to music or take aromatherapy and individual therapy.",
,"If you feel painful, you may need to take Tramadol, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen.",
,"If you feel anxious, you may need to take Clonazepam, Alprazolam, Lorazepam.",
,"If you feel depressed, you may need to take SertralineDuloxetineFluoxetine.",
What should I do if my heart beat so fast?,"If you heart beats faster than normal, you may need to take Atenolol, Metoprolol and Metoprolol Succinate ER.",
What is asthma?,"Asthma is a chronic, long-term disease that causes inflammation and blockage of a person’s airways. While no cure exists, many measures are available that can help people control the condition and improve their quality of life.",
Could you please tell me what is Asthma?,"Asthma, also called bronchial asthma, is a disease that affects your lungs. It’s a chronic (ongoing) condition, meaning it doesn’t go away and needs ongoing medical management. Asthma affects more than 25 million people in the U.S. currently. This total includes more than 5 million children. Asthma can be life-threatening if you don’t get treatment.",
What is asthma attack? What could happen in asthma attack?,"When you breathe normally, muscles around your airways are relaxed, letting air move easily and quietly. During an asthma attack, three things can happen:

Bronchospasm: The muscles around the airways constrict (tighten). When they tighten, it makes your airways narrow. Air cannot flow freely through constricted airways.
Inflammation: The lining of your airways becomes swollen. Swollen airways don’t let as much air in or out of your lungs.
Mucus production: During the attack, your body creates more mucus. This thick mucus clogs airways.
When your airways get tighter, you make a sound called wheezing when you breathe, a noise your airways make when you breathe out. You might also hear an asthma attack called an exacerbation or a flare-up. It’s the term for when your asthma isn’t controlled.",
Who can get asthma?,Anyone can develop asthma at any age. People with allergies or people exposed to tobacco smoke are more likely to develop asthma. This includes secondhand smoke (exposure to someone else who is smoking) and thirdhand smoke (exposure to clothing or surfaces in places where some has smoked). Statistics show that people assigned female at birth tend to have asthma more than people assigned male at birth. Asthma affects Black people more frequently than other races.,
What causes asthma?,"Researchers don’t know why some people have asthma while others don’t. But certain factors present a higher risk:Allergies: Having allergies can raise your risk of developing asthma. Environmental factors: People can develop asthma after exposure to things that irritate the airways. These substances include allergens, toxins, fumes and second- or third-hand smoke. These can be especially harmful to infants and young children whose immune systems haven’t finished developing. Genetics: If your family has a history of asthma or allergic diseases, you have a higher risk of developing the disease. Respiratory infections: Certain respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can damage young children’s developing lungs.",
What are common asthma attack triggers?,"You can have an asthma attack if you come in contact with substances that irritate you. Healthcare providers call these substances “triggers.” Knowing what triggers your asthma makes it easier to avoid asthma attacks. For some people, a trigger can bring on an attack right away. For other people, or at other times, an attack may start hours or days later. Triggers can be different for each person. But some common triggers include: Air pollution: Many things outside can cause an asthma attack. Air pollution includes factory emissions, car exhaust, wildfire smoke and more. Dust mites: You can’t see these bugs, but they are in our homes. If you have a dust mite allergy, this can cause an asthma attack. Exercise: For some people, exercising can cause an attack. Mold: Damp places can spawn mold, which can cause problems if you have asthma. You don’t even have to be allergic to mold to have an attack. Pests: Cockroaches, mice and other household pests can cause asthma attacks.
Pets: Your pets can cause asthma attacks. If you’re allergic to pet dander (dried skin flakes), breathing in the dander can irritate your airways. Tobacco smoke: If you or someone in your home smokes, you have a higher risk of developing asthma. You should never smoke in enclosed places like the car or home, and the best solution is to quit smoking. Your provider can help. Strong chemicals or smells. These things can trigger attacks in some people. Certain occupational exposures. You can be exposed to many things at your job, including cleaning products, dust from flour or wood, or other chemicals. These can all be triggers if you have asthma.",
What are the signs and symptoms of asthma?,"People with asthma usually have obvious symptoms. These signs and symptoms resemble many respiratory infections: Chest tightness, pain or pressure. Coughing (especially at night). Shortness of breath. Wheezing. With asthma, you may not have all of these symptoms with every flare. You can have different symptoms and signs at different times with chronic asthma. Also, symptoms can change between asthma attacks.",
How do healthcare providers diagnose asthma?,"Your healthcare provider will review your medical history, including information about your parents and siblings. Your provider will also ask you about your symptoms. Your provider will need to know any history of allergies, eczema (a bumpy rash caused by allergies) and other lung diseases. Your provider may order spirometry. This test measures airflow through your lungs and is used to diagnose and monitor your progress with treatment. Your healthcare provider may order a chest X-ray, blood test or skin test.",
What asthma treatment options are there?,"You have options to help manage your asthma. Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to control symptoms. These include: Bronchodilators: These medicines relax the muscles around your airways. The relaxed muscles let the airways move air. They also let mucus move more easily through the airways. These medicines relieve your symptoms when they happen and are used for intermittent and chronic asthma. Anti-inflammatory medicines: These medicines reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways. They make it easier for air to enter and exit your lungs. Your healthcare provider may prescribe them to take every day to control or prevent your symptoms of chronic asthma.
Biologic therapies for asthma: These are used for severe asthma when symptoms persist despite proper inhaler therapy.
You can take asthma medicines in several different ways. You may breathe in the medicines using a metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer or another type of asthma inhaler. Your healthcare provider may prescribe oral medications that you swallow.",
What is asthma control?,The goal of asthma treatment is to control symptoms. Asthma control means you: Can do the things you want to do at work and home. Have no (or minimal) asthma symptoms. Rarely need to use your reliever medicine (rescue inhaler). Sleep without asthma interrupting your rest.,
How do you monitor asthma symptoms?,You should keep track of your asthma symptom. It’s an important piece of managing the disease. Your healthcare provider may ask to use a peak flow (PF) meter. This device measures how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. It can help your provider make adjustments to your medication. It also tells you if your symptoms are getting worse.,
How can I prevent an asthma attack?,"If your healthcare provider says you have asthma, you’ll need to figure out what triggers an attack. Avoiding the triggers can help you avoid an attack. You can’t prevent yourself from getting asthma, though.",
What’s the outlook for someone with asthma?,"If you have asthma, you can still live a very productive life and participate in sports and other activities. Your healthcare provider can help you manage symptoms, learn your triggers and prevent or manage attacks.",
What is an asthma action plan?,Your healthcare provider will work with you to develop an asthma action plan. This plan tells you how and when to use your medicines. It also tells you what to do based on your asthma symptoms and when to seek emergency care. Ask your healthcare provider about anything you don’t understand.,
What should I do if I have a severe asthma attack?,"If you have a severe asthma attack, you need to get immediate medical care. The first thing you should do is use your rescue inhaler. A rescue inhaler uses fast-acting medicines to open up your airways. It’s different than a maintenance inhaler, which you use every day. You should use the rescue inhaler when symptoms are bothering you and you can use it more frequently if your flare is severe. If your rescue inhaler doesn’t help or you don’t have it with you, go to the emergency department if you have:
Anxiety or panic.
Bluish fingernails, bluish lips (in light-skinned people) or gray or whitish lips or gums (in dark-skinned people).
Chest pain or pressure.
Coughing that won’t stop or severe wheezing when you breathe.
Difficulty talking.
Pale, sweaty face.
Very quick or rapid breathing.",
What should I go for a doctor?,"Contact your doctor
See your doctor:
If you think you have asthma. If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from getting worse over time.
To monitor your asthma after diagnosis. If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack.
If your asthma symptoms get worse. Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often.

Don't take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse.

To review your treatment. Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments.",
Could you let me know what is asthma?,"Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs.[3] It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms.[9][10] Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.[2] These may occur a few times a day or a few times per week.[3] Depending on the person, asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise.[3]

Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.[4] Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens.[3] Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers.[3] Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry lung function testing.[5] Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.[11] It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.[12][13]

There is no known cure for asthma, but it is easily treatable.[3] Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and respiratory irritants, and suppressed with the use of inhaled corticosteroids.[6][14] Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled.[15][16] Treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth.[7] In very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required.[17]

In 2019 asthma affected approximately 262 million people and caused approximately 461,000 deaths.[8] Most of the deaths occurred in the developing world.[3] Asthma often begins in childhood,[3] and the rates have increased significantly since the 1960s.[18] Asthma was recognized as early as Ancient Egypt.[19] The word ""asthma"" is from the Greek ἄσθμα, ásthma, which means ""panting"".[20]",

What's the sign of asthma?,"Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[21] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[22] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[23] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[24] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[25]

A number of other health conditions occur more frequently in people with asthma, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), rhinosinusitis, and obstructive sleep apnea.[26] Psychological disorders are also more common,[27] with anxiety disorders occurring in between 16 and 52% and mood disorders in 14–41%.[28] It is not known whether asthma causes psychological problems or psychological problems lead to asthma.[29] Current asthma, but not former asthma, is associated with increased all-cause mortality, heart disease mortality, and chronic lower respiratory tract disease mortality.[30] Asthma, particularly severe asthma, is strongly associated with development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).[31][32][33] Those with asthma, especially if it is poorly controlled, are at increased risk for radiocontrast reactions.[34]

Cavities occur more often in people with asthma.[35] This may be related to the effect of beta 2 agonists decreasing saliva.[36] These medications may also increase the risk of dental erosions.[36]",
How do you know if do or don’t have asthma?,You’ll need to see a healthcare provider to find out if you have asthma or some other condition. There are other respiratory diseases that make it hard to breathe or cause coughing and wheezing.,
Why is my asthma worse at night?,"Asthma that gets worse at night is sometimes called nighttime asthma or nocturnal asthma. There are no definite reasons that this happens, but there are some educated guesses. These include:

The way you sleep: Sleeping on your back can result in mucus dripping into your throat or acid reflux coming back up from your stomach. Also, sleeping on your back puts pressure on your chest and lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. However, lying face down or on your side can put pressure on your lungs.
Triggers in your bedroom and triggers that happen in the evening: You may find your blankets, sheets and pillows have dust mites, mold or pet hair on them. If you’ve been outside in the early evening, you may have brought pollen in with you.
Medication side effects: Some drugs that treat asthma, such as steroids and montelukast, can affect your sleep.
Air that’s too hot or too cold: Hot air can cause airways to narrow when you breathe in. Cold air is an asthma trigger for some people.
Lung function changes: Lung function lessens at night as a natural process.
Asthma is poorly controlled during the day: Symptoms that aren’t controlled during the day won’t be better at night. It’s important to work with your provider to make sure your asthma symptoms are controlled both day and night. Treating nighttime symptoms is very important. Serious asthma attacks, and sometimes deaths, can happen at night.",
What should I know about COVID-19 and asthma?,"If you have asthma that is moderate-to-severe, or if your asthma symptoms aren’t well controlled, you’re at greater risk of having to be hospitalized if you get COVID-19. Therefore, you should wear a mask if you go to indoor spaces with other people, get vaccinated and avoid exposure to people who have the virus.",
,"Common asthma signs and symptoms in children ages 5 to 11 include:

Coughing, particularly at night
Wheezing
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain, tightness or discomfort
Avoiding or losing interest in sports or physical activities
Some children have few day-to-day symptoms, but have severe asthma attacks now and then. Other children have mild symptoms or symptoms that get worse at certain times. You may notice that your child's asthma symptoms get worse at night, with activity, when your child has a cold, or with triggers such as cigarette smoke or seasonal allergies.",
,"Risk factors
A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. They include:

Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling
Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis — which causes red, itchy skin — or hay fever — which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes
Being overweight
Being a smoker
Exposure to secondhand smoke
Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution
Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing",
,"Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening and require a trip to the emergency room. Signs and symptoms of an asthma emergency in children ages 5 to 11 include:

Significant trouble breathing
Persistent coughing or wheezing
No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)
Being unable to speak without gasping
Peak flow meter readings in the red zone",
,"For children 5 years of age and older, doctors can diagnose and monitor asthma with the same tests used for adults, such as spirometry and peak flow meters. They measure how much air your child can quickly force out of his or her lungs, an indication of how well the lungs are working.

",
,"The doctor may give your child a portable, hand-held device (peak flow meter) to measure how well his or her lungs are working. A peak flow meter measures how much air your child can quickly exhale.

Low readings indicate worsening asthma. You and your child may notice low peak flow readings before symptoms become apparent. This will help you recognize when to adjust treatment to prevent an asthma flare-up.",
,"If your child's asthma symptoms are severe, your family doctor or pediatrician may refer your child to see an asthma specialist.

The doctor will want your child to take just the right amount and type of medication needed to control his or her asthma. This will help prevent side effects.

Based on your record of how well your child's current medications seem to control signs and symptoms, your child's doctor may ""step up"" treatment to a higher dose or add another type of medication. If your child's asthma is well controlled, the doctor may ""step down"" treatment by reducing your child's medications. This is known as the stepwise approach to asthma treatment.",
,"Known as maintenance medications, these are generally taken every day on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma. These medications may be used seasonally if your child's asthma symptoms become worse during certain times of the year.

Types of long-term control medications include:

Inhaled corticosteroids. These are the most common long-term control medications for asthma. These anti-inflammatory drugs include fluticasone (Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), beclomethasone (Qvar RediHaler), ciclesonide (Alvesco, Omnaris) and mometasone (Asmanex HFA).
Leukotriene modifiers. These include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo). They can be used alone or as an addition to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.

In rare cases, montelukast and zileuton have been linked to psychological reactions such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away if your child has any unusual psychological reaction.

Combination inhalers. These medications contain an inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting beta agonist (LABA). They include the combinations fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair HFA), budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), fluticasone-vilanterol (Breo, Ellipta) and mometasone-formoterol (Dulera). In some situations, long-acting beta agonists have been linked to severe asthma attacks.

LABA medications should only be given to children when they are combined with a corticosteroid in a combination inhaler. This reduces the risk of a severe asthma attack.

Theophylline. This is a daily medication that opens the airways (bronchodilator). Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin) is not used as often now as in past years.
Biologics. Nucala, an injectable medication, is given to children every four weeks to help control severe asthma. Children age 6 and older may benefit from the addition of this therapy to their current treatment plan.",
,"These medications — called short-acting bronchodilators — provide immediate relief of asthma symptoms and last four to six hours. Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) is the most commonly used short-acting bronchodilator for asthma. Levalbuterol (Xopenex) is another.

Although these medications work quickly, they can't keep your child's symptoms from coming back. If your child has frequent or severe symptoms, he or she will need to take a long-term control medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid.

Your child's asthma is not under control if he or she often needs to use a quick-relief inhaler. Relying on a quick-relief inhaler to control symptoms puts your child at risk of a severe asthma attack and is a sign that your child needs to see the doctor about making treatment changes. Track the use of quick-relief medications, and share the information with your child's doctor at every visit.

Asthma attacks are treated with rescue medications, and oral or injectable corticosteroids.",
,"Most asthma medications are given with a device that allows a child to breathe medication directly into the lungs. Your child's medication may be delivered with one of these devices:

Metered dose inhaler. Small hand-held devices, metered dose inhalers are a common delivery method for asthma medication. To make sure your child gets the correct dose, he or she may also need a hollow tube (spacer) that attaches to the inhaler.
Dry powder inhalers. For certain asthma medications, your child may have a dry powder inhaler. This device requires a deep, rapid inhalation to get the full dose of medication.
Nebulizer. A nebulizer turns medications into a fine mist your child breathes in through a face mask. Nebulizers can deliver larger doses of medications into the lungs than inhalers can. Young children often need to use a nebulizer because it's difficult or impossible for them to use other inhaler devices.",
,"Allergy-desensitization shots (immunotherapy) may help if your child has allergic asthma that can't be easily controlled by avoiding asthma triggers. Your child will begin with skin tests to determine which allergy-causing substances (allergens) may trigger asthma symptoms.

Once your child's asthma triggers are identified, he or she will get a series of injections containing small doses of those allergens. Your son or daughter will probably need injections once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years. Your child's allergic reactions and asthma symptoms should gradually diminish.

Omalizumab (Xolair) is an injectable treatment that can help allergic asthma that isn't well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids.",
,"Managing your child's asthma can seem like an overwhelming responsibility. Following these steps will help make it easier.

Learn about asthma
A critical part of managing your child's asthma is learning exactly what steps to take on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis. It's also important that you understand the purpose of each part of tracking symptoms and adjusting treatment. You, your child and caretakers need to:

Understand the different types of medications for asthma and how they work
Learn to recognize and record signs and symptoms of worsening asthma
Know what to do when your child's asthma gets worse
Track symptoms with a written plan
A written asthma action plan is an important tool to let you know how well treatment is working, based on your child's symptoms. With your child's doctor, create a written asthma plan that outlines the steps needed to manage your child's asthma. You and your child's caretakers, including babysitters, teachers and coaches, should have a copy of the plan.

The plan can help you and your child:

Track how often your child has asthma flare-ups (exacerbations)
Judge how well medications are controlling symptoms
Note any medication side effects, such as shaking, irritability or trouble sleeping
Check how well your child's lungs are working with a peak flow meter
Measure how much your child's symptoms affect daily activities such as play, sleep and sports
Adjust medications when symptoms get worse
Recognize when to see a doctor or seek emergency care
Many asthma plans use a stoplight system of green, yellow and red zones that correspond to worsening symptoms. This system can help you quickly determine asthma severity and identify signs of an asthma attack. Some asthma plans use a symptoms questionnaire called the Asthma Control Test to measure asthma severity over the past month.

Control asthma triggers
Taking steps to help your child avoid triggers is an important part of controlling asthma. Asthma triggers vary from child to child. Work with your child's doctor to identify triggers and steps you can take to help your child avoid them. Common asthma triggers include:

Colds or other respiratory infections
Allergens such as dust mites or pollen
Pet dander
Exercise
Cold weather
Mold and dampness
Cockroach exposure
Cigarette smoke and other irritants in the air
Severe heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD)",
,"Other drugs are used in asthma treatment uncommonly and in specific circumstances. Magnesium is often used in the emergency department, but it is not recommended in the management of chronic asthma.

Immunotherapy may be indicated when symptoms are triggered by allergy, as suggested by history and confirmed by allergy testing. Immunotherapy is generally more effective in children than adults. If symptoms are not significantly relieved after 24 months, then therapy is stopped. If symptoms are relieved, therapy should continue for ≥ 3 years, although the optimum duration is unknown.

Other drugs that suppress the immune system are occasionally given to reduce dependence on high-dose oral corticosteroids, but these drugs have a significant risk of toxicity. Low-dose methotrexate (5 to 15 mg orally or IM once a week) can lead to modest improvements in FEV1 and modest decreases in daily oral corticosteroid use. Gold and cyclosporine are also modestly effective, but toxicity and need for monitoring limit their use.

Other therapies for management of chronic asthma include nebulized lidocaine, nebulized heparin, colchicine, and high-dose IV immune globulin. Limited evidence supports the use of any of these therapies, and their benefits are unproved, so none are currently recommended for routine clinical use.",
,"Beta agonists
Beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists and beta agonists relax bronchial smooth muscle, decrease mast cell degranulation and histamine release, inhibit microvascular leakage into the airways, and increase mucociliary clearance. Beta-2 agonist preparations may be short-acting, long-acting, or ultra–long-acting (see tables Drug Treatment of Chronic Asthma and Drug Treatment of Asthma Exacerbations).

Short-acting beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol) 2 puffs every 4 hours inhaled as needed are the drug of choice for relieving acute bronchoconstriction and preventing exercise-induced asthma. They should not be used alone for long-term maintenance of chronic asthma. They take effect within minutes and are active for up to 6 to 8 hours, depending on the drug. Tachycardia and tremor are the most common acute adverse effects of inhaled beta agonists and are dose-related. Mild hypokalemia occurs uncommonly. Use of levalbuterol (a solution containing the R-isomer of albuterol) theoretically minimizes adverse effects, but its long-term efficacy and safety are unproved. Oral beta agonists have more systemic effects and generally should be avoided.

Long-acting beta agonists (eg, salmeterol) are active for up to 12 hours. They are used for moderate and severe asthma but should never be used as monotherapy. They interact synergistically with inhaled corticosteroids and permit lower dosing of corticosteroids.

Ultra-long-acting beta agonists (eg, indacaterol) are active for up to 24 hours and as with long-acting beta agonists are used for moderate to severe asthma, and should never be used as a monotherapy. They interact synergistically with inhaled corticosteroids and permit lower dosing of corticosteroids.

The safety of regular long-term use of beta agonists has been confirmed by multiple randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses, including a large international safety study that was followed by removal of a black box warning by the Food and Drug Administration (1). Because the safety and efficacy of long-acting beta agonists have been demonstrated only when used in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid, all long-acting and ultra-long beta agonists should be used only in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid for patients whose condition is not adequately controlled with other asthma controllers (eg, low- to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly warrants additional maintenance therapies. Daily use or diminishing effects of short-acting beta agonists or use of ≥ 1 canister per month suggests inadequate control and the need to begin or intensify other therapies.",
What Is Asthma?,"
Asthma is a disease that affects your lungs. It is one of the most common long-term diseases of children, but adults can have asthma, too. Asthma causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing at night or early in the morning. If you have asthma, you have it all the time, but you will have asthma attacks only when something bothers your lungs.

We don’t know all the things that can cause asthma, but we do know that genetic, environmental, and occupational factors have been linked to developing asthma.

If someone in your immediate family has asthma, you are more likely to have it. “Atopy,” the genetic tendency to develop an allergic disease, can play a big part in developing allergic asthma. However, not all asthma is allergic asthma.

Being exposed to things in the environment, like mold or dampness, some allergens such as dust mites, and secondhand tobacco smoke have been linked to developing asthma. Air pollution and viral lung infection may also lead to asthma.

Occupational asthma occurs when someone who never had asthma develops it because he or she is exposed to something at work. This can happen if you develop an allergy to something at work such as mold or if you are exposed to irritants such as wood dust or chemicals at work over and over at lower levels or all at once at higher levels.",
How Can You Tell if You Have Asthma?,"
It can be hard to tell if someone has asthma, especially in children under age 5. Having a doctor check how well your lungs work and check for allergies can help you find out if you have asthma.

During a checkup, a doctor will ask if you cough a lot, especially at night. He or she will also ask whether your breathing problems are worse after physical activity or at certain times of year. The doctor will then ask about chest tightness, wheezing, and colds lasting more than 10 days. He or she will ask whether anyone in your family has or has had asthma, allergies, or other breathing problems. Finally, the doctor will ask questions about your home and whether you have missed school or work or have trouble doing certain things.

The doctor may also do a breathing test, called spirometry, to find out how well your lungs are working by testing how much air you can breathe out after taking a very deep breath before and after you use asthma medicine.",
What Is an Asthma Attack?,"An asthma attack may include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, and trouble breathing. The attack happens in your body’s airways, which are the paths that carry air to your lungs. As the air moves through your lungs, the airways become smaller, like the branches of a tree are smaller than the tree trunk. During an asthma attack, the sides of the airways in your lungs swell and the airways shrink. Less air gets in and out of your lungs, and mucous that your body makes clogs up the airways.

You can control your asthma by knowing the warning signs of an asthma attack, staying away from things that cause an attack, and following your doctor’s advice. When you control your asthma:

you won’t have symptoms such as wheezing or coughing,
you’ll sleep better,
you won’t miss work or school,
you can take part in all physical activities, and
you won’t have to go to the hospital.",
What Causes an Asthma Attack?,"An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to “asthma triggers.” Your asthma triggers can be very different from someone else’s asthma triggers. Know your triggers and learn how to avoid them. Watch out for an attack when you can’t avoid your triggers. Some of the most common triggers are tobacco smoke, dust mites, outdoor air pollution, cockroach allergen, pets, mold, smoke from burning wood or grass, and infections like flu.",
How Is Asthma Treated?,"Take your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you and stay away from things that can trigger an attack to control your asthma.

Everyone with asthma does not take the same medicine.

You can breathe in some medicines and take other medicines as a pill. Asthma medicines come in two types—quick-relief and long-term control. Quick-relief medicines control the symptoms of an asthma attack. If you need to use your quick-relief medicines more and more, visit your doctor to see if you need a different medicine. Long-term control medicines help you have fewer and milder attacks, but they don’t help you while you are having an asthma attack.

Asthma medicines can have side effects, but most side effects are mild and soon go away. Ask your doctor about the side effects of your medicines.

Remember – you can control your asthma. With your doctor’s help, make your own asthma action plan. Decide who should have a copy of your plan and where he or she should keep it. Take your long-term control medicine even when you don’t have symptoms.",

,"Asthma is caused by a combination of complex and incompletely understood environmental and genetic interactions.[4][37] These influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment.[38] It is believed that the recent increased rates of asthma are due to changing epigenetics (heritable factors other than those related to the DNA sequence) and a changing living environment.[39] Asthma that starts before the age of 12 years old is more likely due to genetic influence, while onset after age 12 is more likely due to environmental influence.[40]",
,"Many environmental factors have been associated with asthma's development and exacerbation, including, allergens, air pollution, and other environmental chemicals.[41] Smoking during pregnancy and after delivery is associated with a greater risk of asthma-like symptoms.[42] Low air quality from environmental factors such as traffic pollution or high ozone levels[43] has been associated with both asthma development and increased asthma severity.[44] Over half of cases in children in the United States occur in areas when air quality is below the EPA standards.[45] Low air quality is more common in low-income and minority communities.[46]

Exposure to indoor volatile organic compounds may be a trigger for asthma; formaldehyde exposure, for example, has a positive association.[47] Phthalates in certain types of PVC are associated with asthma in both children and adults.[48][49] While exposure to pesticides is linked to the development of asthma, a cause and effect relationship has yet to be established.[50][51]

The majority of the evidence does not support a causal role between acetaminophen (paracetamol) or antibiotic use and asthma.[52][53] A 2014 systematic review found that the association between acetaminophen use and asthma disappeared when respiratory infections were taken into account.[54] Acetaminophen use by a mother during pregnancy is also associated with an increased risk of the child developing asthma.[55] Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy is a risk factor for the child to develop asthma.[56]

Asthma is associated with exposure to indoor allergens.[57] Common indoor allergens include dust mites, cockroaches, animal dander (fragments of fur or feathers), and mold.[58][59] Efforts to decrease dust mites have been found to be ineffective on symptoms in sensitized subjects.[60][61] Weak evidence suggests that efforts to decrease mold by repairing buildings may help improve asthma symptoms in adults.[62] Certain viral respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus,[20] may increase the risk of developing asthma when acquired as young children.[63] Certain other infections, however, may decrease the risk.[20]",
,"The hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses.[64][65] It has been proposed that the reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses is due, in part, to increased cleanliness and decreased family size in modern societies.[66] Exposure to bacterial endotoxin in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction.[67] Evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of asthma on farms and in households with pets.[66]

Use of antibiotics in early life has been linked to the development of asthma.[68] Also, delivery via caesarean section is associated with an increased risk (estimated at 20–80%) of asthma – this increased risk is attributed to the lack of healthy bacterial colonization that the newborn would have acquired from passage through the birth canal.[69][70] There is a link between asthma and the degree of affluence which may be related to the hygiene hypothesis as less affluent individuals often have more exposure to bacteria and viruses.[71]",
,"Family history is a risk factor for asthma, with many different genes being implicated.[73] If one identical twin is affected, the probability of the other having the disease is approximately 25%.[73] By the end of 2005, 25 genes had been associated with asthma in six or more separate populations, including GSTM1, IL10, CTLA-4, SPINK5, LTC4S, IL4R and ADAM33, among others.[74] Many of these genes are related to the immune system or modulating inflammation. Even among this list of genes supported by highly replicated studies, results have not been consistent among all populations tested.[74] In 2006 over 100 genes were associated with asthma in one genetic association study alone;[74] more continue to be found.[75]

Some genetic variants may only cause asthma when they are combined with specific environmental exposures.[4] An example is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism in the CD14 region and exposure to endotoxin (a bacterial product). Endotoxin exposure can come from several environmental sources including tobacco smoke, dogs, and farms. Risk for asthma, then, is determined by both a person's genetics and the level of endotoxin exposure.[72]",
,"A triad of atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis and asthma is called atopy.[76] The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease;[63] with asthma occurring at a much greater rate in those who have either eczema or hay fever.[77] Asthma has been associated with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg–Strauss syndrome), an autoimmune disease and vasculitis.[78] Individuals with certain types of urticaria may also experience symptoms of asthma.[76]

There is a correlation between obesity and the risk of asthma with both having increased in recent years.[79][80] Several factors may be at play including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of fat and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state.[81]

Beta blocker medications such as propranolol can trigger asthma in those who are susceptible.[82] Cardioselective beta-blockers, however, appear safe in those with mild or moderate disease.[83][84] Other medications that can cause problems in asthmatics are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and NSAIDs.[85] Use of acid suppressing medication (proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers) during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma in the child.[86]",
,"Some individuals will have stable asthma for weeks or months and then suddenly develop an episode of acute asthma. Different individuals react to various factors in different ways.[87] Most individuals can develop severe exacerbation from a number of triggering agents.[87]

Home factors that can lead to exacerbation of asthma include dust, animal dander (especially cat and dog hair), cockroach allergens and mold.[87][88] Perfumes are a common cause of acute attacks in women and children. Both viral and bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract can worsen the disease.[87] Psychological stress may worsen symptoms – it is thought that stress alters the immune system and thus increases the airway inflammatory response to allergens and irritants.[44][89]

Asthma exacerbations in school‐aged children peak in autumn, shortly after children return to school. This might reflect a combination of factors, including poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and altered immune tolerance. There is limited evidence to guide possible approaches to reducing autumn exacerbations, but while costly, seasonal omalizumab treatment from four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations.[90]",
,"Asthma is the result of chronic inflammation of the conducting zone of the airways (most especially the bronchi and bronchioles), which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding smooth muscles. This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing. The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment. Occasionally the airways themselves change.[21] Typical changes in the airways include an increase in eosinophils and thickening of the lamina reticularis. Chronically the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands. Other cell types involved include T lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. There may also be involvement of other components of the immune system, including cytokines, chemokines, histamine, and leukotrienes among others.[20]",
,"While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.[20] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as ""a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment"".[21]

There is currently no precise test for the diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time.[5][20] Asthma may be suspected if there is a history of recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution.[91] Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis.[91] In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry.[92]

Spirometry
Spirometry is recommended to aid in diagnosis and management.[93][94] It is the single best test for asthma. If the FEV1 measured by this technique improves more than 12% and increases by at least 200 milliliters following administration of a bronchodilator such as salbutamol, this is supportive of the diagnosis. It however may be normal in those with a history of mild asthma, not currently acting up.[20] As caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma, the use of caffeine before a lung function test may interfere with the results.[95] Single-breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from COPD.[20] It is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person's asthma is controlled.[96]

Others
The methacholine challenge involves the inhalation of increasing concentrations of a substance that causes airway narrowing in those predisposed. If negative it means that a person does not have asthma; if positive, however, it is not specific for the disease.[20]

Other supportive evidence includes: a ≥20% difference in peak expiratory flow rate on at least three days in a week for at least two weeks, a ≥20% improvement of peak flow following treatment with either salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids or prednisone, or a ≥20% decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger.[97] Testing peak expiratory flow is more variable than spirometry, however, and thus not recommended for routine diagnosis. It may be useful for daily self-monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for checking the effectiveness of new medications. It may also be helpful in guiding treatment in those with acute exacerbations.[98]",
,"Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.[11] Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic), based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens (atopic) or not (non-atopic).[12] While asthma is classified based on severity, at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system.[99] Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research.[99]

Although asthma is a chronic obstructive condition, it is not considered as a part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as this term refers specifically to combinations of disease that are irreversible such as bronchiectasis and emphysema.[100] Unlike these diseases, the airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible; however, if left untreated, the chronic inflammation from asthma can lead the lungs to become irreversibly obstructed due to airway remodeling.[101] In contrast to emphysema, asthma affects the bronchi, not the alveoli.[102] The combination of asthma with a component of irreversible airways obstruction has been termed the asthma-chronic obstructive disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS). Compared to other people with ""pure"" asthma or COPD, people with ACOS exhibit increased morbidity, mortality and possibly more comorbidities.[103]",
,"An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an asthma attack. The classic symptoms are shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness.[20] The wheezing is most often when breathing out.[105] While these are the primary symptoms of asthma,[106] some people present primarily with coughing, and in severe cases, air motion may be significantly impaired such that no wheezing is heard.[104] In children, chest pain is often present.[107]

Signs occurring during an asthma attack include the use of accessory muscles of respiration (sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles of the neck), there may be a paradoxical pulse (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation), and over-inflation of the chest.[108] A blue color of the skin and nails may occur from lack of oxygen.[109]

In a mild exacerbation the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is ≥200 L/min, or ≥50% of the predicted best.[110] Moderate is defined as between 80 and 200 L/min, or 25% and 50% of the predicted best, while severe is defined as ≤ 80 L/min, or ≤25% of the predicted best.[110]

Acute severe asthma, previously known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators and corticosteroids.[111] Half of cases are due to infections with others caused by allergen, air pollution, or insufficient or inappropriate medication use.[111]

Brittle asthma is a kind of asthma distinguishable by recurrent, severe attacks.[104] Type 1 brittle asthma is a disease with wide peak flow variability, despite intense medication. Type 2 brittle asthma is background well-controlled asthma with sudden severe exacerbations.[104]",
,"Exercise can trigger bronchoconstriction both in people with or without asthma.[112] It occurs in most people with asthma and up to 20% of people without asthma.[112] Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is common in professional athletes. The highest rates are among cyclists (up to 45%), swimmers, and cross-country skiers.[113] While it may occur with any weather conditions, it is more common when it is dry and cold.[114] Inhaled beta2-agonists do not appear to improve athletic performance among those without asthma,[115] however, oral doses may improve endurance and strength.[116][117]",
,"Asthma as a result of (or worsened by) workplace exposures is a commonly reported occupational disease.[118] Many cases, however, are not reported or recognized as such.[119][120] It is estimated that 5–25% of asthma cases in adults are work-related. A few hundred different agents have been implicated, with the most common being: isocyanates, grain and wood dust, colophony, soldering flux, latex, animals, and aldehydes. The employment associated with the highest risk of problems include: those who spray paint, bakers and those who process food, nurses, chemical workers, those who work with animals, welders, hairdressers and timber workers.[118]

Aspirin-induced asthma
Main article: Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease
Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also known as aspirin-induced asthma, affects up to 9% of asthmatics.[121] AERD consists of asthma, nasal polyps, sinus disease, and respiratory reactions to aspirin and other NSAID medications (such as ibuprofen and naproxen).[122] People often also develop loss of smell and most experience respiratory reactions to alcohol.[123]

Alcohol-induced asthma
Main article: Alcohol-induced respiratory reactions
Alcohol may worsen asthmatic symptoms in up to a third of people.[124] This may be even more common in some ethnic groups such as the Japanese and those with aspirin-induced asthma.[124] Other studies have found improvement in asthmatic symptoms from alcohol.[124]

Non-atopic asthma
Non-atopic asthma, also known as intrinsic or non-allergic, makes up between 10 and 33% of cases. There is negative skin test to common inhalant allergens. Often it starts later in life, and women are more commonly affected than men. Usual treatments may not work as well.[125] The concept that ""non-atopic"" is synonymous with ""non-allergic"" is called into question by epidemiological data that the prevalence of asthma is closely related to the serum IgE level standardized for age and sex (P<0.0001), indicating that asthma is almost always associated with some sort of IgE-related reaction and therefore has an allergic basis, although not all the allergic stimuli that cause asthma appear to have been included in the battery of aeroallergens studied (the ""missing antigen(s)"" hypothesis).[126] For example, an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of population-attributable risk (PAR) of Chlamydia pneumoniae biomarkers in chronic asthma found that the PAR for C. pneumoniae-specific IgE was 47%.[127]

Infectious asthma
When queried, asthma patients may report that their first asthma symptoms began after an acute lower respiratory tract illness. This type of history has been labelled the ""infectious asthma"" (IA) syndrome,[128] or as ""asthma associated with infection"" (AAWI)[129] to distinguish infection-associated asthma initiation from the well known association of respiratory infections with asthma exacerbations. Reported prevalences of IA for adults range from around 40% in a primary care practice[128] to 70% in a specialty practice treating mainly severe asthma patients.[130] The true population prevalence of IA in adult-onset asthma is unknown because clinicians are not trained to elicit this type of history routinely, and recollection in child-onset asthma is challenging.

Differential diagnosis
Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[131] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[132] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[131]

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma. After the age of 65, most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD. In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi. However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and smoking cessation.[133] It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.[134][135]

Prevention
The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[136] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[137][138] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[136]

Early pet exposure may be useful.[139] Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive[140] and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet.[141]

Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective at preventing asthma in children and are not recommended.[141] Omega-3 consumption, mediterranean diet and anti-oxidants have been suggested by some studies that might help preventing crisis but the evidence is still inconclusive.[142]

Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective.[118] It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affects the risk of exacerbations.[143] Immunization, however, is recommended by the World Health Organization.[144] Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma.[145]

Management
While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved.[146] The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, pets, or aspirin, and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended. Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories.[147][148] The medications listed below have demonstrated efficacy in improving asthma symptoms, however ""real world"" use-effectiveness is limited as around half of people with asthma worldwide remain sub-optimally controlled, even when treated.[149][150][151] People with asthma may remain sub-optimally controlled either because optimum doses of asthma medications do not work (called ""refractory"" asthma) or because individuals are either unable (e.g. inability to afford treatment, poor inhaler technique) or unwilling (e.g., wish to avoid side effects of corticosteroids) to take optimum doses of prescribed asthma medications (called ""difficult to treat"" asthma). In practice, it is not possible to distinguish ""refractory"" from ""difficult to treat"" categories for patients who have never taken optimum doses of asthma medications. A related issue is that the asthma efficacy trials upon which the pharmacological treatment guidelines are based have systematically excluded the majority of people with asthma.[152][153] For example, asthma efficacy treatment trials always exclude otherwise eligible people who smoke, and smoking blunts the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, the mainstay of asthma control management.[154][155][156]

Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer by mouth is recommended. For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, corticosteroids by mouth are added to these treatments.[7]

People with asthma have higher rates of anxiety, psychological stress, and depression.[157][158] This is associated with poorer asthma control.[157] Cognitive behavioral therapy may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels in people with asthma.[157]

Improving people's knowledge about asthma and using a written action plan has been identified as an important component of managing asthma.[159] Providing educational sessions that include information specific to a person's culture is likely effective.[160] More research is necessary to determine if increasing preparedness and knowledge of asthma among school staff and families using home-based and school interventions results in long term improvements in safety for children with asthma.[161][162][163] School-based asthma self-management interventions, which attempt to improve knowledge of asthma, its triggers and the importance of regular practitioner review, may reduce hospital admissions and emergency department visits. These interventions may also reduce the number of days children experience asthma symptoms and may lead to small improvements in asthma-related quality of life.[164] More research is necessary to determine if shared-decision-making is helpful for managing adults with asthma[165] or if a personalized asthma action plan is effective and necessary.[166] Some people with asthma use pulse oximeters to monitor their own blood oxygen levels during an asthma attack. However, there is no evidence regarding the use in these instances.[167]

Lifestyle modification
Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks. The most common triggers include allergens, smoke (from tobacco or other sources), air pollution, non selective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods.[168][169] Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids.[170] Laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma.[145] Dust mite control measures, including air filtration, chemicals to kill mites, vacuuming, mattress covers and others methods had no effect on asthma symptoms.[60] There is insufficient evidence to suggest that dehumidifiers are helpful for controlling asthma.[171]

Overall, exercise is beneficial in people with stable asthma.[172] Yoga could provide small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.[173] More research is necessary to determine how effective weight loss is on improving quality of life, the usage of health care services, and adverse effects for people of all ages with asthma.[174][175]

Medications
Medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms; and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation.[147] Antibiotics are generally not needed for sudden worsening of symptoms or for treating asthma at any time.[176][177]",
,"Short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (SABA), such as salbutamol (albuterol USAN) are the first line treatment for asthma symptoms.[7] They are recommended before exercise in those with exercise induced symptoms.[178]
Anticholinergic medications, such as ipratropium, provide additional benefit when used in combination with SABA in those with moderate or severe symptoms and may prevent hospitalizations.[7][179][180] Anticholinergic bronchodilators can also be used if a person cannot tolerate a SABA.[100] If a child requires admission to hospital additional ipratropium does not appear to help over a SABA.[181] For children over 2 years old with acute asthma symptoms, inhaled anticholinergic medications taken alone is safe but is not as effective as inhaled SABA or SABA combined with inhaled anticholinergic medication.[182][179] Adults who receive combined inhaled medications that includes short-acting anticholinergics and SABA may be at risk for increased adverse effects such as experiencing a tremor, agitation, and heart beat palpitations compared to people who are treated with SABA by itself.[180]
Older, less selective adrenergic agonists, such as inhaled epinephrine, have similar efficacy to SABAs.[183] They are however not recommended due to concerns regarding excessive cardiac stimulation.[184]
Corticosteroids can also help with the acute phase of an exacerbation because of their antiinflamatory properties. The benefit of systemic and oral corticosteroids is well established. Inhaled or nebulized corticosteroids can also be used.[142]For adults and children who are in the hospital due to acute asthma, systemic (IV) corticosteroids improve symptoms.[185][186] A short course of corticosteroids after an acute asthma exacerbation may help prevent relapses and reduce hospitalizations.[187]
Other remedies, less established, are intravenous or nebulized magnesium sulfate and helium mixed with oxygen. Aminophylline could be used with caution as well.[142]
Mechanical ventilation is the last resort in case of severe hypoxemia.[142]
Intravenous administration of the drug aminophylline does not provide an improvement in bronchodilation when compared to standard inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment.[188] Aminophylline treatment is associated with more adverse effects compared to inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment.[188]",
What is the most effective treatment for long-term control?,"Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control.[147] Inhaled forms are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed.[147] Dosage depends on the severity of symptoms.[189] High dosage and long term use might lead to the appearance of common adverse effects which are growth delay, adrenal suppression, and osteoporosis.[142] Continuous (daily) use of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than its intermitted use, seems to provide better results in controlling asthma exacerbations.[142] Commonly used corticosteroids are budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide.[142]
Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.[190][191] In children this benefit is uncertain.[190][192][191] When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects,[193] and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.[194][195] Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations.[196] Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.[196]
Leukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast) may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, typically also in conjunction with a LABA.[16][197][198][199] For adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well, the addition of anti-leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces the risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.[198] Anti-leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults, however there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti-leukotriene receptor alone.[200] In those under five years of age, anti-leukotriene agents were the preferred add-on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids.[142][201] A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children.[202] A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.[16][203] As of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.[16]
Mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are safe alternatives to corticosteroids but not preferred because they have to be administered frequently.[147][16]
Oral Theophyllines are sometimes used for controlling chronic asthma, but their used is minimized because of their side effects.[142]
Omalizumab, a monoclonal Antibody Against IgE, is a novel way to lessen exacerbations by lessening the levels of circulating IgE that play a significant role at allergic asthma.[142][204]
Anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide have not been shown to be beneficial for treating chronic asthma in children over 2 years old,[205] but is not suggested for routine treatment of chronic asthma in adults.[206]
There is no strong evidence to recommend chloroquine medication as a replacement for taking corticosteroids by mouth (for those who are not able to tolerate inhaled steroids).[207] Methotrexate is not suggested as a replacement for taking corticosteriods by mouth (""steroid sparing"") due to the adverse effects associated with taking methotrexate and the minimal relief provided for asthma symptoms.[208]
Macrolide antibiotics, particularly the azalide macrolide azithromycin, are a recently added GINA-recommended treatment option for both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe, refractory asthma based on azithromycin's efficacy in reducing moderate and severe exacerbations combined.[209][210] Azithromycin's mechanism of action is not established, and could involve pathogen- and/or host-directed anti-inflammatory activities.[211] Limited clinical observations suggest that some patients with new-onset asthma and with ""difficult-to-treat"" asthma (including those with the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome - ACOS) may respond dramatically to azithromycin.[212][213] However, these groups of asthma patients have not been studied in randomized treatment trials and patient selection needs to be carefully individualized.
For children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.[214] In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.[215] Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.[215] Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.[215]

Delivery methods
Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.[216] For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.[217] There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.[218] There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.[219]

Adverse effects
Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.[220] Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth.[220][221][222] Rinsing the mouth after the use of inhaled steroids can decrease the risk of thrush.[223] Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.[224]

Others
Inflammation in the lungs can be estimated by the level of exhaled nitric oxide.[225][226] The use of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO) to guide asthma medication dosing may have small benefits for preventing asthma attacks but the potential benefits are not strong enough for this approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children.[225][226]

When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups. Additional options include:

Humidified Oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.[142]
Corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone.[227] One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids.[228]
Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks.[17][229][230] In adults intravenous treatment results in a reduction of hospital admissions.[231] Low levels of evidence suggest that inhaled (nebulised) magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for treating acute asthma in adults.[232] Overall, high quality evidence do not indicate a large benefit for combining magnesium sulfate with standard inhaled treatments for adults with asthma.[232]
Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.[17]
Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.[233]
Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists.[233] Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.[234]
The dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this.[235]
For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option.[236] It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.[236][237] While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown.[238]
Monoclonal antibody injections such as mepolizumab,[239] dupilumab,[240] or omalizumab may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma.[241] However, as of 2019 these medications are expensive and their use is therefore reserved for those with severe symptoms to achieve cost-effectiveness.[242] Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R), including mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab, in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations. There is limited evidence for improved health-related quality of life and lung function.[243]
Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.[244]
It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.[245]
Alternative medicine
Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[246][247] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies.

Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C or vitamin E for controlling asthma.[248][249] There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced bronchospasm.[250] Fish oil dietary supplements (marine n-3 fatty acids)[251] and reducing dietary sodium[252] do not appear to help improve asthma control. In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations, however, it is not clear if this is only helpful for people who have low vitamin D levels to begin with (low baseline vitamin D).[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplements improve day-to-day asthma symptoms or a person's lung function.[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that adults with asthma should avoid foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG).[254] There have not been enough high-quality studies performed to determine if children with asthma should avoid eating food that contains MSG.[254]

Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use.[255][256] Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.[257] Manual therapies, including osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma.[258] The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.[148] Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use.[255] There is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma.[259]

Prognosis
The prognosis for asthma is generally good, especially for children with mild disease.[260] Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care.[261] In 2010 the death rate was 170 per million for males and 90 per million for females.[262] Rates vary between countries by 100 fold.[262]

Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004 (16 million of which are in low and middle income countries).[263] Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade.[73] Airway remodeling is observed, but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes.[264] Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorates a decline in lung function.[265] Asthma in children also has negative effects on quality of life of their parents.[266]",
What medication is not recommended to adults?,"Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control.[147] Inhaled forms are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed.[147] Dosage depends on the severity of symptoms.[189] High dosage and long term use might lead to the appearance of common adverse effects which are growth delay, adrenal suppression, and osteoporosis.[142] Continuous (daily) use of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than its intermitted use, seems to provide better results in controlling asthma exacerbations.[142] Commonly used corticosteroids are budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide.[142] Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.[190][191] In children this benefit is uncertain.[190][192][191] When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects,[193] and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.[194][195] Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations.[196] Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.[196] Leukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast) may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, typically also in conjunction with a LABA.[16][197][198][199] For adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well, the addition of anti-leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces the risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.[198] Anti-leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults, however there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti-leukotriene receptor alone.[200] In those under five years of age, anti-leukotriene agents were the preferred add-on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids.[142][201] A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children.[202] A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.[16][203] As of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.[16] Mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are safe alternatives to corticosteroids but not preferred because they have to be administered frequently.[147][16] Oral Theophyllines are sometimes used for controlling chronic asthma, but their used is minimized because of their side effects.[142] Omalizumab, a monoclonal Antibody Against IgE, is a novel way to lessen exacerbations by lessening the levels of circulating IgE that play a significant role at allergic asthma.[142][204] Anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide have not been shown to be beneficial for treating chronic asthma in children over 2 years old,[205] but is not suggested for routine treatment of chronic asthma in adults.[206] There is no strong evidence to recommend chloroquine medication as a replacement for taking corticosteroids by mouth (for those who are not able to tolerate inhaled steroids).[207] Methotrexate is not suggested as a replacement for taking corticosteriods by mouth (""steroid sparing"") due to the adverse effects associated with taking methotrexate and the minimal relief provided for asthma symptoms.[208] Macrolide antibiotics, particularly the azalide macrolide azithromycin, are a recently added GINA-recommended treatment option for both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe, refractory asthma based on azithromycin's efficacy in reducing moderate and severe exacerbations combined.[209][210] Azithromycin's mechanism of action is not established, and could involve pathogen- and/or host-directed anti-inflammatory activities.[211] Limited clinical observations suggest that some patients with new-onset asthma and with ""difficult-to-treat"" asthma (including those with the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome - ACOS) may respond dramatically to azithromycin.[212][213] However, these groups of asthma patients have not been studied in randomized treatment trials and patient selection needs to be carefully individualized.

Additional options include: Humidified Oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.[142] Corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone.[227] One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids.[228] Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks.[17][229][230] In adults intravenous treatment results in a reduction of hospital admissions.[231] Low levels of evidence suggest that inhaled (nebulised) magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for treating acute asthma in adults.[232] Overall, high quality evidence do not indicate a large benefit for combining magnesium sulfate with standard inhaled treatments for adults with asthma.[232] Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.[17] Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.[233] Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists.[233] Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.[234] The dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this.[235] For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option.[236] It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.[236][237] While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown.[238] Monoclonal antibody injections such as mepolizumab,[239] dupilumab,[240] or omalizumab may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma.[241] However, as of 2019 these medications are expensive and their use is therefore reserved for those with severe symptoms to achieve cost-effectiveness.[242] Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R), including mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab, in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations. There is limited evidence for improved health-related quality of life and lung function.[243] Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.[244] It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.[245] Alternative medicine Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[246][247] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies. Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C or vitamin E for controlling asthma.[248][249] There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced bronchospasm.[250] Fish oil dietary supplements (marine n-3 fatty acids)[251] and reducing dietary sodium[252] do not appear to help improve asthma control. In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations, however, it is not clear if this is only helpful for people who have low vitamin D levels to begin with (low baseline vitamin D).[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplements improve day-to-day asthma symptoms or a person's lung function.[253] There is no strong evidence to suggest that adults with asthma should avoid foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG).[254] There have not been enough high-quality studies performed to determine if children with asthma should avoid eating food that contains MSG.[254] Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use.[255][256] Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.[257] Manual therapies, including osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma.[258] The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.[148] Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use.[255] There is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma.[259] Prognosis The prognosis for asthma is generally good, especially for children with mild disease.[260] Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care.[261] In 2010 the death rate was 170 per million for males and 90 per million for females.[262] Rates vary between countries by 100 fold.[262] Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004 (16 million of which are in low and middle income countries).[263] Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade.[73] Airway remodeling is observed, but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes.[264] Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorates a decline in lung function.[265] Asthma in children also has negative effects on quality of life of their parents.[266]",
What medicine is userful to children?,"Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control.[147] Inhaled forms are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed.[147] Dosage depends on the severity of symptoms.[189] High dosage and long term use might lead to the appearance of common adverse effects which are growth delay, adrenal suppression, and osteoporosis.[142] Continuous (daily) use of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than its intermitted use, seems to provide better results in controlling asthma exacerbations.[142] Commonly used corticosteroids are budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide.[142] Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.[190][191] In children this benefit is uncertain.[190][192][191] When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects,[193] and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.[194][195] Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations.[196] Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.[196] Leukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast) may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, typically also in conjunction with a LABA.[16][197][198][199] For adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well, the addition of anti-leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces the risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.[198] Anti-leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults, however there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti-leukotriene receptor alone.[200] In those under five years of age, anti-leukotriene agents were the preferred add-on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids.[142][201] A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children.[202] A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.[16][203] As of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.[16] Mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are safe alternatives to corticosteroids but not preferred because they have to be administered frequently.[147][16] Oral Theophyllines are sometimes used for controlling chronic asthma, but their used is minimized because of their side effects.[142] Omalizumab, a monoclonal Antibody Against IgE, is a novel way to lessen exacerbations by lessening the levels of circulating IgE that play a significant role at allergic asthma.[142][204] Anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide have not been shown to be beneficial for treating chronic asthma in children over 2 years old,[205] but is not suggested for routine treatment of chronic asthma in adults.[206] There is no strong evidence to recommend chloroquine medication as a replacement for taking corticosteroids by mouth (for those who are not able to tolerate inhaled steroids).[207] Methotrexate is not suggested as a replacement for taking corticosteriods by mouth (""steroid sparing"") due to the adverse effects associated with taking methotrexate and the minimal relief provided for asthma symptoms.[208] Macrolide antibiotics, particularly the azalide macrolide azithromycin, are a recently added GINA-recommended treatment option for both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe, refractory asthma based on azithromycin's efficacy in reducing moderate and severe exacerbations combined.[209][210] Azithromycin's mechanism of action is not established, and could involve pathogen- and/or host-directed anti-inflammatory activities.[211] Limited clinical observations suggest that some patients with new-onset asthma and with ""difficult-to-treat"" asthma (including those with the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome - ACOS) may respond dramatically to azithromycin.[212][213] However, these groups of asthma patients have not been studied in randomized treatment trials and patient selection needs to be carefully individualized. For children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.[214] In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.[215] Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.[215] Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.[215] Delivery methods Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used.

What kind of treatment is not recommended for asthma?,"Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control.[147] Inhaled forms are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed.[147] Dosage depends on the severity of symptoms.[189] High dosage and long term use might lead to the appearance of common adverse effects which are growth delay, adrenal suppression, and osteoporosis.[142] Continuous (daily) use of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than its intermitted use, seems to provide better results in controlling asthma exacerbations.[142] Commonly used corticosteroids are budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide.[142] Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.[190][191] In children this benefit is uncertain.[190][192][191] When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects,[193] and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.[194][195] Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations.[196] Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.[196] Leukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast) may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, typically also in conjunction with a LABA.[16][197][198][199] For adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well, the addition of anti-leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces the risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.[198] Anti-leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults, however there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti-leukotriene receptor alone.[200] In those under five years of age, anti-leukotriene agents were the preferred add-on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids.[142][201] A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children.[202] A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.[16][203] As of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.[16] Mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are safe alternatives to corticosteroids but not preferred because they have to be administered frequently.[147][16] Oral Theophyllines are sometimes used for controlling chronic asthma, but their used is minimized because of their side effects.[142] Omalizumab, a monoclonal Antibody Against IgE, is a novel way to lessen exacerbations by lessening the levels of circulating IgE that play a significant role at allergic asthma.[142][204] Anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide have not been shown to be beneficial for treating chronic asthma in children over 2 years old,[205] but is not suggested for routine treatment of chronic asthma in adults.[206] There is no strong evidence to recommend chloroquine medication as a replacement for taking corticosteroids by mouth (for those who are not able to tolerate inhaled steroids).[207] Methotrexate is not suggested as a replacement for taking corticosteriods by mouth (""steroid sparing"") due to the adverse effects associated with taking methotrexate and the minimal relief provided for asthma symptoms.[208] Macrolide antibiotics, particularly the azalide macrolide azithromycin, are a recently added GINA-recommended treatment option for both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe, refractory asthma based on azithromycin's efficacy in reducing moderate and severe exacerbations combined.[209][210] Azithromycin's mechanism of action is not established, and could involve pathogen- and/or host-directed anti-inflammatory activities.[211] Limited clinical observations suggest that some patients with new-onset asthma and with ""difficult-to-treat"" asthma (including those with the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome - ACOS) may respond dramatically to azithromycin.[212][213] However, these groups of asthma patients have not been studied in randomized treatment trials and patient selection needs to be carefully individualized. For children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.[214] In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.[215] Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.[215] Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.[215] Delivery methods Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.[216] For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.[217] There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.[218] There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.[219] Adverse effects Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.[220] Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth.[220][221][222] Rinsing the mouth after the use of inhaled steroids can decrease the risk of thrush.[223] Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.[224] Others Inflammation in the lungs can be estimated by the level of exhaled nitric oxide.[225][226] The use of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO) to guide asthma medication dosing may have small benefits for preventing asthma attacks but the potential benefits are not strong enough for this approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children.[225][226] When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups. Additional options include: Humidified Oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.[142] Corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone.[227] One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids.[228] Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks.[17][229][230] In adults intravenous treatment results in a reduction of hospital admissions.[231] Low levels of evidence suggest that inhaled (nebulised) magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for treating acute asthma in adults.[232] Overall, high quality evidence do not indicate a large benefit for combining magnesium sulfate with standard inhaled treatments for adults with asthma.[232] Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.[17] Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.[233] Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists.[233] Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.[234] The dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this.[235] For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option.[236] It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.[236][237] While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown.[238] Monoclonal antibody injections such as mepolizumab,[239] dupilumab,[240] or omalizumab may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma.[241] However, as of 2019 these medications are expensive and their use is therefore reserved for those with severe symptoms to achieve cost-effectiveness.[242] Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R), including mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab, in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations. There is limited evidence for improved health-related quality of life and lung function.[243] Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.[244] It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.[245] Alternative medicine Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[246][247] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies. Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C or vitamin E for controlling asthma.[248][249] There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced bronchospasm.[250] Fish oil dietary supplements (marine n-3 fatty acids)[251] and reducing dietary sodium[252] do not appear to help improve asthma control.

Prevent carbon monoxide poisoning when using generators for breathing treatments during power outages
When a power outage occurs after a storm, some people may use generators as a backup power source. These generators provide power to appliances, lights, and other vital items in the home, including “breathing treatments” for asthma (also known as nebulizer machines). Using generators improperly can cause poisonous gas (carbon monoxide) to build up in a home, garage, or camper. Never use a generator indoors or less than 20 feet from any window, door, or vent. When using a generator, use a battery-powered or battery backup carbon monoxide detector. This website has information on how to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning after an emergency.

Prevent carbon monoxide poisoning when using generators for breathing treatments during power outages
When a power outage occurs after a storm, some people may use generators as a backup power source. These generators provide power to appliances, lights, and other vital items in the home, including “breathing treatments” for asthma (also known as nebulizer machines). Using generators improperly can cause poisonous gas (carbon monoxide) to build up in a home, garage, or camper. Never use a generator indoors or less than 20 feet from any window, door, or vent. When using a generator, use a battery-powered or battery backup carbon monoxide detector. This website has information on how to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning after an emergency.

,"If you have asthma, an asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to “asthma triggers.” Your triggers can be very different from those of someone else with asthma. Know your triggers and learn how to avoid them. Watch out for an attack when you can’t avoid the triggers. Some of the most common triggers are:

Tobacco Smoke
Tobacco smoke is unhealthy for everyone, especially people with asthma. If you have asthma and you smoke, quit smoking.

“Secondhand smoke” is smoke created by a smoker and breathed in by a second person. Secondhand smoke can trigger an asthma attack. Make your home a smoke-free zone. Encourage household members who smoke to quit. If you have asthma, people should never smoke near you, in your home, in your car, or wherever you may spend a lot of time.

Dust Mites
Dust mites are microscopic bugs that are in many homes. If you have asthma and are allergic to dust mites, they can trigger an asthma attack. To prevent attacks:

Use allergen-proof mattress and pillowcase covers to make a barrier between dust mites and yourself.
Don’t use down-filled pillows, quilts, or comforters.
Wash your bedding weekly and dry it completely.
Vacuum carpets, area rugs, and floors regularly using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter.
Keep relative humidity levels in the home low, around 30- 50%.
Outdoor Air Pollution
Outdoor air pollution can trigger an asthma attack. This pollution can come from many sources, including factories, cars, or wildfire smoke. Wildfire smoke from burning wood or other plants is made up of a mix of harmful gases and small particles. Breathing in too much of this smoke can cause an asthma attack.

Pay attention to air quality forecasts on radio, television, and the internet and check your newspaper to plan your activities for when air pollution levels will be low.

Pests (e.g., cockroaches, mice)
Cockroaches and other pests are often found where food is eaten and crumbs are left behind. To control pests in your home:

Remove as many water and food sources as you can.
Clean dishes, crumbs, and spills right away.
Store food in airtight containers.
Keep trash in a closed container.
At least every 2 to 3 days, vacuum or sweep areas that might attract cockroaches or mice.
Keep counters, sinks, tables, and floors clean and free of clutter.
Seal cracks or openings in cabinets, walls, baseboards, and around plumbing.
Use pesticide baits and traps in areas away from children and pets, following manufacturers’ instructions.
Avoid using sprays and foggers as these can cause asthma attacks.
Pets
Furry pets can trigger an asthma attack if you are allergic to them. If you think a furry pet may be causing attacks, you may want to find the pet another home. If you can’t or don’t want to find a new home for the pet, decrease your exposure by:

Keeping pets out of bedrooms,
Washing furry pets,
Using an air cleaner with HEPA filter, and
Using allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers.
People with asthma are not allergic to their pet’s fur, so trimming a pet’s fur will not help your asthma.

Mold
Breathing in mold can trigger an asthma attack whether or not you are allergic to mold. Indoor mold growth is often found in damp areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, and basements, or in areas where water damage has occurred. There are many types of mold which can be found in any climate. Get rid of mold in your home to help control your attacks.

To reduce mold exposure in your home:

Dry damp or wet items within 24 to 48 hours to prevent mold growth.
Fix water leaks, such as leaky plumbing, which let mold grow behind walls and under floors as soon as you can.
Replace absorbent materials, such as ceiling tiles and carpet, if mold is present.
Use an air conditioner or dehumidifier to maintain low indoor humidity.
Get a small tool called a hygrometer to check humidity levels and keep them as low as you can—no higher than 50%. Humidity levels change over the course of a day, so check the humidity levels more than once a day.
Scrub mold off hard surfaces with detergent and water. Dry completely.
Empty and clean refrigerator and air conditioner drip pans regularly.
Run the bathroom exhaust fan or open the window when showering.

Cleaning and Disinfection
Disinfectants can trigger an asthma attack. People with asthma should try to stay away when cleaners or disinfectants are being used and right after their use. Follow these precautions when cleaning or disinfecting places where people with asthma may spend time, such as homes, schools, or workplaces:

Avoid overuse of products. To help limit your exposure to asthma triggers, follow a schedule for cleaning and disinfecting to prevent overuse of products.
Use safer products. Any disinfectant can trigger an asthma attack, but you can take steps to reduce the chances of that happening:
Use soap and water or cleaners certified by the EPA Safer Choice programexternal icon to clean surfaces.
Clean visibly dirty surfaces before disinfecting.
Never mix disinfectant products.
Choose products for disinfecting that are less likely to cause an asthma attack, such as products with hydrogen peroxide (no stronger than 3%) or ethanol (ethyl alcohol). Ensure that products with hydrogen peroxide or ethanol do not contain other chemicals that can cause an asthma attack such as peroxyacetic acid or peracetic acid.
Avoid using bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or quaternary ammonium compounds in enclosed spaces and limit their use.
Avoid products with fragrances. The fragrances can trigger asthma attacks.
Make sure there is enough air flow (ventilation).
Open doors and windows to bring in fresh air, if it’s safe to do so.
Improve ventilation by turning on exhaust fans. Exhausting the air (blowing it outside) is the most effective way to remove disinfectant vapors.
For buildings with heating or cooling systems that have fresh (outdoor) air intakes, turn on the fresh air intake to bring in fresh air.
Using a high efficiency filter (MERV 13 or higher) with your heating and cooling system can help keep air clean by removing particles such as smoke, pollen, and traffic pollution from the air. Most air filters will not remove disinfectant vapors, though.
Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions and to replace the filter as needed. Some systems cannot accept high efficiency filters. In this case, using the highest MERV rating possible will provide the most effective air cleaning.
Use products safely and correctly.
Always follow the instructions on the product label. Do not mix chemical products together.
Wear protective gear such as gloves and goggles.
Spray or pour spray products onto a cleaning cloth or paper towel instead of spraying the product directly onto the cleaning surface (if the product label allows) to help limit exposure.
Follow EPA’s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Useexternal icon.
Avoid disturbing dust because it can be an asthma trigger.
Move away from the trigger (such as the area that was cleaned) if you experience an asthma attack, and follow your Asthma Action Plan. Call 911 for medical emergencies.

Other Triggers
Infections linked to influenza (flu), colds, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can trigger an asthma attack. Sinus infections, allergies, pollen, breathing in some chemicals, and acid reflux can also trigger attacks.

Physical exercise; some medicines; bad weather, such as thunderstorms or high humidity; breathing in cold, dry air; and some foods, food additives, and fragrances can also trigger an asthma attack.

Strong emotions can lead to very fast breathing, called hyperventilation, that can also cause an asthma attack.",
