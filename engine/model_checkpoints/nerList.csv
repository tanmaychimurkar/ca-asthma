"So I finally got my pulmonolgist appt after years of not seeing one. It's also a sleep study center. Because of my last 4-5 chest infections this year and severe allergies/allergy infections I've had to go on a bunch of courses of steroids which I'm also allergic to turns out lol. Well i gained 30lbs over the time. I'm already deeply upset about it. I'm already working on it. I've lost 40lbs before so I know I can. 

Anyway I did all the pft tests. Coughed my brains out. Saw spots. Got dizzy and light headed. The tech was great though. Get to the doctor after an eternity. He's incredibly rude, disrespectful, and arrogant. And he just says sleep apnea over and over and over and makes a comment on my weight without me getting any chance to explain it. He doesn't listen to my chest. ""Exam"" must be a joke to him. He doesn't do anything, but condescendingly tell me when I'm ready to get better come treat my sleep apnea.

 I've never been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I know it's possible, but how would that explain the rest of my symptoms? And how would that explain me having next to no sleep apnea symptoms?

He didn't ask me a single question about anything else. I had to beg him to give me anything that will help break this constant mucus up. All the while he was trying to get out the door asap. Now he wants me to spend 260 on a sleep study insurance mysteriously says they'll cover, but doesn't the woman at the desk says. 


Q- He gave me Spiriva respiramat when I asked for something for my sticky difficult to deal with mucus in my throat and nose. It says it commonly causes allergy infections which I get almost constantly. Experiences and thoughts anyone? I'm going to call the pharmacist too. Doc was useless with any question. Nurse explained how to use it, but I'm scared to because I'm so tired of being sick all the time. 

I'm currently on symbicort and singular. They do help, but not enough. Worked my way up from albuterol to get on what I am already. I'll be trying for a second opinion in the meantime. This guy has a lot of nasty reviews but my primary recommended him so I just trusted it. My mistake.

Thanks for reading if anyone gets this far lol This just really sucked."
"A decade ago an allergist told me I dont have asthma, just have asthma like symptoms to allergies. I have no idea why he phrased it that way but I finally realize that allergic asthma is a thing. Especially after my current allergists office kept mentioning my asthma and looking confused when I say I dont have it. 

Anyway, spring is worst for me and its pretty bad here right now. I just want to see if anyone has suggestions I haven't thought of yet.

Right now I'm on

Montelukast 10mg, 1x a day in morning

Loratadine 1x a day in afternoon

Nasal spray, 2x a day, one each in morning, one at bed
Azelastine spray
Fluticasone spray

Eye drops for itchy eyes

Inhaler if needed

We have a drafty old house, but I still seem fine as long as I stay inside. Even if I open a window. But as soon as I go outside I have trouble. I literally can't even walk around the block without stopping to rest.

Last year was so bad I finally started allergy shots. Not even a year in and my dust allergy is already reduced! But now pollen season hit and there's no change in that. 

The only obvious allergy thing i get is itchy eyes. Other than that I'm not sneezing or coughing. My nose isn't running. Its all my lungs.

I'm also pretty sure the Loratadine is doing nothing.

So, anything im missing? Anything I could try?"
Howdy there is there a way to improve my asthma simply through (youre gonna laugh) breathing? Like meditating and just focusing on huge breaths and whatnot. I know there is but I want advice from others first.
"So I‚Äôm just enjoying the evening and I starting coughing, having shortness of breath and getting a bit wheezy after a bout of laughter. And after taking a couple puffs of Salbutamol it still won‚Äôt go away. What should I do?"
"Does anyone else get a heavy feeling or feel like your heart is dropping (idk if that's the best way to describe it, but that's the best I've got) right before an attack? Like I'll be around saw dust or smoke, then get the feeling in my chest and a few minutes later I start having an attack."
"So I like many of you probably have been really careful since March 2020 to not get COVID. I am fortunate enough to be able to work at home. I have all three vaccines and wear an N95 mask whenever I need to go somewhere.

I‚Äôve had asthma (and once pneumonia) as a child and always treated any sort of breathing issues with lots of consideration.

So my question is in two parts. As a 31 year old male I‚Äôm watching my life pass by and seeing all my friends going out maskless to bars and sports games, weddings, etc. They don‚Äôt have the same health issue I do, god bless them, but they don‚Äôt understand my reluctance. I also know I have a tendency to be over anxious, so figured I‚Äôd ask. How are all of you dealing with this? Any strategies or anything of the sort?

And my second question is for those of you who had COVID. What was it like an asthmatic? Did you find yourself better equipped to deal with it since we‚Äôre used to realizing what a gift breathing actually is? Did you find it harsher than what your peers went through?

Anyways, I hope this is okay. I don‚Äôt participate in the sub, but lurk often. Please be well all, and love to all of you guys in this weird time ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Hi All,

I grew up in SoCal and moved to Seattle 8 years ago. Within a couple weeks of moving here, I got a pretty bad case of asthma and got an official diagnosis after 3 months of coughing and wheezing. I never had a hint of any respiratory illness before that. I went to an allergist right after and got tested for a wide variety of allergens and no allergies whatsoever. 

I have since been healthy and not really had an serious attacks. I maybe used my recue inhaler 1-2 times year. Anyway, I was in Hawaii from Nov-Jan for work. I flew back to Seattle on Feb 1 and with an hour of landing, I got the worst attack. No amount of albuterol helped. I was in bad shape for 6 weeks with weekly visits to my doctor trying Prednisone, anti-biotics, claritin, flonase, mucinex, cough suppressants etc with no use.

 I ended up going to the ER in March after I coughed so badly that I threw up. I was finally given Advair and I was basically healed overnight. I am still confused as to what my trigger could be? Could it be the weather and rain in Seattle? I though SoCal was dusty, polluted and had worse air quality, but I feel a million times better when I travel back home.

I just want to know what's triggering my attacks."
"Hello all, long time lurker  [26F] with moderate to severe asthma that's (mostly) contained.

I recently developed an essential tremor in my right hand. My doctor had said it's likely not the asthma medications since I've been using Albuterol since childhood. He wants to try a low dose extended release beta blocker, specifically propranolol. He mentioned side effects but I did a little digging to find that it can exacerbate asthma symptoms. I was told if I have any discomfort to stop the medication immediately. How worried should I be?"
"I thought this was kind of interesting so I thought I would share and see other people's experiences. Singulair has been destroying my sleep, among other things, so I have weaned myself off of it. It's actually about the 3rd time I've tried doing it, the first 2 times my lungs felt like they were really closing up within 24 hours or so, so I immediately went back on. But this time I stuck it out, lungs did feel like they were closing, but now after 48 hours, they feel fine!! However, I'm feeling pretty dizzy, kind of close to spinning at times. But I'm figuring/hoping it will pass soon. 

The first 2 times I was wondering if the lungs closing was a rebound effect, and it almost kind of feels like it was, for me anyway. I don't know if anyone has had this kind of experience, mostly I've seen people report that they experience no real withdrawal effects. Pretty sure my dizziness is from the withdrawal."
"These glowing hunks of [pink-orange salt](https://www.pinksaltwall.com/collections/salt-lamps) purport to send purifying ions into the air, easing asthma symptoms. Is this is true?"
"I remember when my asthma was uncontrolled, because a medicine known as asmanex (terrible drug btw) stopped working and I wasn‚Äôt sleeping well or exercising, I had so many constipation problems. Now I‚Äôm on flovent things are better. But I recently started waking up at 530 and sleeping 930, my sleep schedule has been disturbed, I‚Äôm not sleeping as well cause my body isn‚Äôt used to this pattern yet and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm constipated üò≥."
"I'm suspecting I have asthma, both of my parents have it and I'm also a long time sufferer with eczema (usually an asthma comorbidity) but I don't have asthma attacks in the traditional way, I can feel something starting before I start showing symptoms, it starts with my throat drying up, then I will start with a coughing fit where I can't catch my breath, it's like I've got something lodged in my throat and il cough for upwards of 5 minutes before I can catch my breath, even drinking doesn't help the cough and obviously after im very out of breath, this happens about 3/4 times a year with no cause. And recently I've started feeling like my lung capacity isn't what it used to be I find myself breathing deeper but not feeling the benefits. But I don't fit the traditional symptoms of asthma as I barely wheeze and cough outside of the ""attacks"" I also frequently yawn sigh and wake up in the night for no explainable reason, does anyone else suffer in the same way or could it just be down to anxiety?"
"I've been trying to start the meditation habit for years, but a lot of the time I notice myself focusing on my breathing instead.  Before being diagnosed, I just thought it was anxiety.  When I try to meditate, all I can think of is how tight my lungs feel and how I can't get enough air. Very frustrating, especially since I know that it would help me with my ADHD."
"So it‚Äôs late, about 5:30 in the morning and I‚Äôm just about to shower and go to bed. I was experiencing a bit of shortness of breath before my shower but while showering I noticed blue areas on my hands and wrists. And even after it won‚Äôt go away. I‚Äôm really worried.
I do not want to have to go to the ER in this time of night/this early in the morning.

But idk what to do."
"Has anybody else had experience with this? I have had severe asthma my whole life. I have all the standard triggers, including animals, exercise, weather, different temps,  mold, dust, you name it, etc. I started microdosing in mid-October taking .2mg every other day to try and help with my migraines. About a month later I was at a friend's house and noticed I could last about 1.5 hours in his house instead of my usual 30 mins or so. From there on every time I was around animals, I seemed to last longer and longer to the point now where I can be around animals 24/7 and have no issues at all. I also no longer have issues with any of my other triggers and my asthma is essentially gone. I have my respirologist appointment coming up in a few months and will bring this up with them to see what their opinion is, but has anyone else had an experience with this? The only information I could find regarding this is a few articles speaking to the powerful anti-inflammatory properties of psychedelics.

"Hi, yesterday i picked up my prescription for Montelukast and i was reading the side effects and it mentioned that vomiting and nausea is common. I have emetophobia üò© so was wondering what montelukast is like for you and what your experience was like?"
"(I say this only for context)
I‚Äôve  gone through the hardest time in my life so far including a spontaneous pneumothorax, countless hospitalizations from asthma attacks which several of which I almost died, my parents divorce when I was a child, an abusive three year relationship

I‚Äôve been really wondering what‚Äôs the point. I am a subscriber to optimistic nihilism but if life is what you make if it then what you make of it is like and I haven‚Äôt felt like I can or will he able to make it. 

I was wondering if anyone else have ever felt this way or would have any advice for me. 

Thanks!"
"Hey all you lovely people on this group, I need your wisdom.
I am new diagnosed with non allergic asthma and chronical bronchitis. I already found out that physical exertion and moist air triggers my asthma. Makes it almost impossible to train (get stamina back) or play with my kids.
But the worst part is that I catch a flu or whatsoever every other week, having fever, coughing etc.
Is there anything I can do to prevent this? Taking Vitamins? Does someone here can relate and give me some advice? My boss is getting mad with me being sick all the time.. I am mad too...

Thanks in advance"
"Hey all, pretty much the title. I lost my insurance coverage and am on a different plan and they wont cover either of these medications.  I can go a day or two without taking it but after that I have some serious trouble breathing then end up puffing my emergency inhaler way too much. Has anyone else had this experience or have a solution? Why are plans that cover this medicine so expensive?"
"Anyone have a suggestion what time to day to take this? Doctor didn't really offer a suggestion; better to start the day with it, or end with it?"
"I recently switched inhalers and my last inhaler was great but now I‚Äôm using a different one (both albuterol just different brands) and it doesn‚Äôt give me much relief and it makes me cough.

Anyone had this happen to them or any ideas?"
"I‚Äôm new to this community. After experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain and feeling like I can‚Äôt catch my breath for years, I finally was able to get a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma and I got an inhaler

After the climax that was getting what I believe was an asthma attack after participating in a sport, I‚Äôm still experiencing the chest pain and shortness of breath a lot of times. There are times when it does go away. But going out is a pain. Using the inhaler does help calm it down. But I‚Äôm a bit worried about why this is. I‚Äôm not sure what to do."
"I was having some mild asthma so I took two puffs of my symbicort inhaler like my doctor prescribed and within thirty minutes my asthma symptoms got so bad I thought I was gonna pass out. Even two hours after the worst of it my throat feels tight and I can barely get any air in through my nose.

Has anyone else had this experience with symbicort? Should I ask my doctor for a different kind of inhaler?"
I have heard about the benefits of visiting a [salt room](https://www.pinksaltwall.com/blogs/salt-therapy) especially for asthma relief from lots of people in my community. So is it actually that good?
"I (M15) started coughing, got a sore throat, and sneezing like crazy out of the blue like 2-3 nights back. In these 2-3 days I have coughed bad a few times that I tasted blood, and when brushing my teeth, I cleaned my tongue and gagged and when I spat it out, in the mucus was very little blood, barely less than a drop, but blood was there.

About a week back I started getting chest tightness, like randomly during the day I'd feel like a weight would appear on my chest, and I would feel weird.

It's worth mentioning that about 2 weeks back I recovered from an insanely terrible viral infection (viral gastroenritis) which caused me to vomit like crazy and gave me diarrhea + loose motion and my body rejected anything I ate...just letting you guys know incase this infection might have something to do with this."

"I never really had issues with colds. i just get very sick and that's it. 1 week ago i get a cold that turned into a bronchitis. my chest hurt and my back too. I went to the doctor and he ask me ¬ødo you smoke? and i said not now bc im quitting, but yeah i used to a lot. (and i used to vapper like 1 week ago so i really think that that fucked me way more) Dr told me i may be asthmatic, my mom is, hers triggered with cigarette, and i think mine too now. It's really hereditary. Now i'm in bed, my back (lungs) and chest feel pressured, i can do deep breaths, but i feel like i'm going to die. This never happened to me before, this is new so i'm way more scared. Last year i had an X-Ray of my lungs and they were normal. I'm going to take another x-ray today bc im pretty sure my lungs are fucked now, hope i will not die. Bye Fellas."

I have a very very old machine and I really think it is time for a new one. Wondering if anyone has any recommendations?
"I'm on a 90 day fill of (generic) Advair 250/50. My last script in January took several days to completely fill, and it was a mix and match of brands (2 purple and that goofy new Hikma one). 

I put my order in for this next fill on Sunday. The store was out of stock, which is not critical; they just need to order more. Two days later the script was ""cancelled"" and rolled over to a Wixela generic, which the store only had a partial fill of.

I'm very diligent about ordering refills 7-10 days before running out of medication, so it's not a big deal. I was just wondering if people have had similar problems getting Advair from Walgreen's in a timely manner.

Thanks."
"Hello there! like everyone here I have asthma, rather I was born with it since birth. I am 19 &amp; I have not had an asthma attack or the need of my inhaler. In fact my doctor took it off my prescription stuff. Now for the my question, anyone here smoke? has it impacted your asthma in any way? when i‚Äôm talking about smoking I mean, posh bars&amp; weed. I would like to know if it would be safe for me to do those things. Another thing is I haven‚Äôt had an asthma attack since I was very very young more than 8+ years ago."
"After two years of being treated for severe asthma, they think it‚Äôs not asthma at all.  They believe I have Vocal Cord Dysfunction. It is misdiagnosed as asthma 80% of the time as the symptoms are the same.  Anyone else had this happen???"
"My allergies have been killing me this year and it makes it hard to breath. I've been using my peak flow meter more to keep track of my numbers and I've noticed after taking a deep breath and breathing out  my chest loosens up quite a bit of phlegm resulting in better breathing. 

What might cause this?"
"Hello fellow sufferers. Its sad but I'm glad there is a subreddit for this.

I will try not making this long but I really would like to hear from you all.
From the UK.

End of 2020 I was studying for my new career and had a big practical test one day. Two days before I decided to have a shroom trip to see if I could calm my thoughts down/work things out.
It backfired and I had my first ever panic attack. Had to control my breathing.

Anyway a couple weeks after I had a bad cold, a week later at night I started coughing. Eventually it was every night and getting worse. Keeping me up at night and then the wheezing started.
One night it was so bad that my airway felt almost closed. I could hardly breathe.
That was the moment I decided to call the docs (at the height of covid)

I was eventually seen and shown them a video of the wheezing. Doctor turned round and said it's asthma.
No tests (because covid wouldn't allow them?).

I'm like 'ok'.
29 yrs old at that point. No history of asthma.

So couple years later I'm on a red inhaler. My mom reckons its anxiety however I don't feel anxious. My job is known to be highly stressful but I'm so laid back I don't care.

I feel absolutely fine but then I start to realise my breathing pattern, then consciously think about it to the point I feel I need to suck air deep/sigh/yawn to eventually feeling this thickness in my throat like I'm breathing through my neck not my nose (however weird that sounds). I then start to wheeze. I breathe in deep and it's like lost air at the bottom of my lungs is released.

If I relax, it goes back to normal. Or if I go to work and I'm busy I'll be fine.

I should also admit that I'm addicted to nicotine and are an ex smoker but have vaped for the last few years.

I don't really want to see a doctor as I think they didn't handle it very well in the first place and also its nearly impossible to get an appointment (since there's only ONE doctor).

Can anyone relate? Help? I miss two years ago when I could breathe üò¢"
"Hi guys. After 3 years on Singulair (montelukast) I have started having terrible anxiety, panic attacks and worsening depression and cannot lose any weight although I routinely eat 1200 cals or less, track my exercise to the tune of - 500 to 900 calories 5-6 days a week. 

Unfortunately my Dr. is 6 months new to me and refuses to believe that Singulair has ever been documented to have adverse side effects. I have found that with her, the best route is doing my own research and advising her what I would like to do with my treatment.

I am looking to those who have stopped Singulair and have found a good alternative to allergic asthma. I assume that many who cannot use it must have had to find alternatives?

I also currently take Zenhale (Dulera) and Ventolin."



"We had a very scary weekend.
My daughter came home from Grandma's on Saturday evening and started to cough here and there and got dramatically worst at night, had her sleep with me and gave her puffers that never seemed to work. By 4 am I had enough, her breathing was so fast and she was having trouble talking so I rushed her to the closest hospital which isn't a children's but I wanted to get there quick. 

They took us right away. Gave her covid test, steroids, did a chest xray and puffers. Seemed to get her oxygen up a little bit but her breathing was still fast. At this point it is now 1pm the next day and they said you can either go home and see if things calm down or go to children's.  So of course we packed up and went to children's. On the way the Dr calls and says that another Dr thought they saw a tiny bit of pneumonia but she literally just finished antibiotics so they weren't sure. 

Get to children's,  get right in. They do 4 rounds of puffers and more steroids to take home. We ask them and 3 Dr at the Children's look at the xray and say they do not see any kind of pneumonia.  That she was indeed having a asthma attack and has some kind of virus wether it is croup or just a bad cold.

Finally we get home at 1 am and she is wired from no sleep and so much inhalers and steroids. Sleeps all night but not me. I'm up worried sick. 

So now today is day 3. She is on Flovent ( I understand it takes a week or two to actually start working) plus she tool her 2nd dose of Dexamethasone she was supposed to take 9ml but spilled some and she took 5 ml. 

Heading to her pediatrician today to do a follow up but I'm so extremely new to this. 
Also have another appointment with her allergist in a week to get her on a official plan because last time he said to me oh she doesn't have asthma do you hear the way she is screaming? Made me so upset bc I knew something was off. Now he is ready to make a action plan with me. 

She seems a little off this morning woth her breathing but she has so much thick mucus coming out once I got that put she seemed okay. Gave her puffers and seems good.

I'm just looking for advice, help anything. I have never dealt with anything like this let alone with my 3 year old daughter. 

Will she be able to have a normal life? Will she always be sick oike this when she gets sick?

I just need words of encouragement, anything really."
"I hesitate to post this because my symptoms are mild, for which I'm very thankful. 

I'm 31 yo man, I noticed in the past year when humidity was very high or when I was anxious that my breathing felt restricted. Those symptoms became constant starting in mid-February, which is when pollen starts in Georgia. Had bronchitis that turned into an ER trip because I felt like I couldn't breathe In late February. 

Was referred to a pulmonologist, had PFT, chest X-ray, allergy panel. Turns out I'm allergic to some local seasonal allergens. Spirometry improved with Albuterol. Diagnosed with mild persistent asthma. They put me on Trelegy which is heckin' expensive. 

I've used Trelegy daily for about a month. Symptoms are still pretty much constant. Can't tell if OTC antihistamines help or not. Other than missed sleep and feeling like I can't take a full breath, I'm fine. Is this typically how seasonal asthma works? Do you just ride it out until Summer?"
"I haven‚Äôt had the flu in the past and I was just diagnosed with it after a swab; along with bronchitis. I‚Äôve had asthma since I was really young and now I‚Äôm kinda nervous considering the past few days I‚Äôve awaken with horrible chest pains. Nebuliser treatments with cough pearls/prescribed liquid cough meds, plus the wonderful dosage of prednisone."
"I'm 19 and hadn't had an asthma attack since I was 12, that was until three months ago. Overnight I started persistently wheezing, I found myself unable to walk and talk at the same time. My doctor told me I had exacerbated asthma, put me on a month of steroids and prescribed me a symbicort inhaler.
3 months in I am still wheezing daily, I don't feel fatigue or breathlessness but that's only if I've taken my symbicort. I go to the gym three times a week (only lift weights, afraid to do cardio, tried running 200 metres once and instantly had an attack), have never tested positive for covid and haven't smoked in 6 months.
I know people grow into and out of asthma throughout their lives, however for so long it was absolutely unnoticeable and now at the age of 19 I feel like a dying 90 year old half the time.
Will this eventually go away? Is there an estimated timeframe? Is this just my lot now and am I just stuck with this til I die? 
Apologies for being melodramatic, I'm just a bit nervous about the future. I have big aspirations, I had even signed up for a marathon in September before all this took over my life."
"20. Had it when younger, exercise and the cold were the main triggers. 

Anyways recently I‚Äôve been noticing that I‚Äôve been breathing with my mouth more because it feels like I can‚Äôt get a full amount of air with my nose. 


Also in the last 2 years I‚Äôll do cardio on and off. Every time I haven‚Äôt done cardio in a while, my chest will hurt for the first several sessions and I‚Äôll be out of breath for a bit. But everyone would be out of breath if they‚Äôre not used to cardio so idk 


Also I noticed my throat seems to tense up sometimes and it feels like my throat starts tightening up. I thought this was prob anxiety related but now I‚Äôm reading that this could be an asthma sign? 


Anyways how often does someone grow out of asthma?"
"Hello all. I posted a few weeks back about my daughter having some issues and going to the emergency room. She‚Äôs doing much better and was has been sleeping through the night since adding flowvent in the morning and night. 

I‚Äôm trying to stem some anxiety within myself. She gets 2 puffs of flowvent in the morning and night, and we have Albuterol when needed/for emergencies. What should I expect? What do flare ups look like? 

For context before the controller and the respiratory therapist letting us know that we can be more aggressive (more puffs more often) with Albuterol we were always getting to the point of instacare or doc offices for steroids which fixed her right up. I‚Äôm trying to get a picture of what a flare up looks like with these meds while keeping a better track of triggers and such. I know that everyone is different so it might not be the same. Any help for a Dad with anxiety. Thanks."
I‚Äôm 6‚Äô8 and 290 pounds I noticed there is a rescue inhaler in my cabinet and I‚Äôm  just wondering if I‚Äôd get any relief using it and how much I should use for my size
"My 12 y/o has asthma and horrible tree pollen allergies, and the spring is making her miserable. Everything is setting her off. One of the weird new asthma triggers we've noticed lately is sneezing. She complains that when she sneezes her breath ""catches"" and her lungs feel tight for a second. She says it goes away as long as she only sneezes once. If she has a fit it triggers a full blown asthma attack. I can't figure out if she's having the attacks because of the pollen that she's allergic to or if the sneezing itself is the trigger. She's adamant it's the latter."
Title says it all.
"I am an adult with pretty controlled asthma, it used to be a lot worse when I was a child, but has gotten better. Usually I'll have mild episodes triggered by summer heat or exercising but nothing that scares me or is out of the ordinary. 

This weekend i was at a wine bar with friends, one of whom had bought a new ouid pen. I'm not a smoker at all, but I've tried it a few times in the past with no major issues, just a little chest tightness. This time though... I started coughing uncontrollably and couldn't get any air in. And stupidly, I forgot my albuterol which I NEVER forget. Everyone went quiet, even the table next to us and I ended up holled up in the bathroom while my friend rubbed my back for 10 minutes. Even afterwards, I couldn't stop wheezing and shaking. It was so embarrassing...  I thought I was going to die lmao"
"I'm desperate. I discovered today the little plastic cone (internet calls it a ""baffle"") that goes inside the container with the medicine is missing on my nebulizer. This is the piece that mists the medication into your lungs. Does anyone know of a pharmacy or store that might sell nebulizer accessories (tubes with a new mouthpiece attachment)? The doctors no longer give nebulizer treatments because of covid so I have no options."
"I have had to take 6 puffs of albuterol for coughing (productive/dry) and a little breathlessness. My chest feels like ass.

I know my asthma is not controlled. The fucking pharmacy doesn‚Äôt have my prescription in stock.

I wasted over half an hour trying to get a hold of the pharmacist to be told my medication should be in stock, today, but it still shows out of stock online.

FML."
"For the last two years, my asthma has been getting worse and worse. I'm about to be 30 this year.

At this point, I'm maxed out an inhaled therapy (spiriva, zenhale, and salbutomol - 200 MCG each).

And spring is here and I hate it. Pollen triggers my asthma so badly.

Every time I get an asthma attack, I'm exhausted. I try to breathe through nose (buteyko method) , activate my parasympathetic nervous system, think calm thoughts, but I am so scared and depressed right now. 

My job is remote for now, so I can lie down for a few mins luckily while my heart is pounding and I'm trying to breathe.

My question for the community here is:

- How do you stay positive / keep a sharp mental game? How do you keep bouncing back mentally from asthma attacks over and over again?

I just feel loss for my old carefree life. Dating life. Enjoying spring air. And now I feel stuck in a loop of asthma attacks and trying to avoid it."
"I need a new peak flow meter, and a decent cheap one seems to be the Phillips. But I am tempted to fork out the cash and get the Mir smart one. Does anyone have a Mir and it is worth it?

For me the big advantage of the Mir, is that I was lazy about recording my results from my old one, and I would lose my booklet where I was supposed to be keeping the results. A smart monitor should get around these problems, but it is pricey..."
hey its currently 12:50 I have been sick for three days not Covid related ( crazy bc i feel worse now than when i had covid) but my asthma has been really bad I stopped taking my Singulair and cetirizine not by choice I had dropped them in the toilet and they were all ruined A couple days prior to me getting sick now I am currently hunched over trying to catch my breath my nose is stuffy I‚Äôm wheezing my back hurts the middle part of my chest hurts I just don‚Äôt wanna wake my mama like I‚Äôm 19 but I still have to walk out her door to go to the ER and I know she‚Äôs gonna yell at me like I‚Äôm scared that it‚Äôs going to be nothing heheee
"I have already been diagnosed with mild persistent asthma last year. I‚Äôve been on a maintenance med (breo 100/25) for almost two weeks now and am still feeling this full inflammation sensation with mucus at times, seemingly with no trigger besides a subtle weather change, if any. Anyone with chronic bronchitis know if it‚Äôs anything like this? I don‚Äôt really understand the difference between the two, since their symptoms overlap."
"He was an MD who was checking me out. He said he heard wheezing in my right lung. I didn't hear or feel anything wheezy in me. 

Anyway, he prescribed me flovent to take twice in the morning and twice at night. He also prescribed me a Ventolin inhaler and Albuterol packages for a nebulizer. He didn't prescribe me a nebulizer though. 

So I decide to try the Ventolin and it didn't really make me feel any better. But when I took a hit of the Ventolin my lungs actually expanded. I've been so used to my lungs being tense that once it was relaxed I could actually breathe better. 

Is a tight chest considered asthma? I really don't wheeze much but I have noticed that my lungs feel overall better since starting asthma meds. 

Thanks!"

"Hey guys, i need some help.

For the first time, i ve got an oral thrush probably cuz of the steroid inhaler. But also, i am staying on dormitory rn and my immunity is total shit. Cuz i am abroad and cant speak language, i dunno what to do. 

Should i stop using the inhaler?

Luckily i am going home in a week, but in the meantime, i do not know, what to do. I am rinsing and brushing my teeths after every use. 

Also, i am using this disk-type powder inhaler and it seems, that i cant fully inhale the powder into my lungs. Could it be connected? On the other hand, when i was home, i was using this inhaler for a longer time without a problem.. 

Thanks in advance for the help."
"Hi everyone , well unfortunately my anxiety is acting up which means its bad for my asthma . last year due to stress and anxiety i ended up with an on going asthma flare that got progressively worse till one day i woke up and i had every symptom . at least a 6/10 out of severity. yesterday my asthma started acting up out of the blue started as a dry cough then wheezing , normally i find it takes weeks of stress and anxiety for it to really effect me really badly . my worst symptom i get is shortness of breath and chest pain and almost that impending doom feeling . and if any of you have suffered that post asthma flare depression .. I absolutely dread it so if anyone has any tips to manage asthma while stressed id love to hear it"
"So from 2020 when I started wearing a mask for COVID, I‚Äôve suddenly started randomly gagging. I noticed that it seems to happen when I‚Äôm not breathing enough air (I sometimes hold in my breath without realizing it or if I‚Äôm talking a lot and walking). I know it‚Äôs linked to the mask and that‚Äôs fine because I now know how to work with it but I was wondering if anyone else has had similar issues? It‚Äôs incredibly annoying and it would be helpful to know what‚Äôs triggering it."
"This is the first time i forgot to and realized after 4 hours‚Ä¶ will i be fine? Im guessing 2 puffs wont be enough to cause oral thrush right? Just want some reassurance as I am worried, have any of you forgotten to wash your mouth once, is it no biggie?"

"Kiddo (4) is getting over a cold, but he still needs his inhaler regularly - like, we‚Äôve given it to him twice in his sleep tonight because he was wheezing regularly. We doubled his Flovent at the onset of the cold per his pediatrician, but if he still needs it this frequently come Monday he‚Äôll be seeing his doctor again and my guess from decades of personal experience as the patient is that steroids will be part of the conversation.

If the doctor decides steroids are what he needs, is there a pediatric formulation that is less gross? Kiddo also has sensory issues and needs serious coaching to use his inhaler while awake because it burns his tongue (even with a spacer and with any of the three types of albuterol rescue inhalers we have in the house), and I know swallow-whole prednisone is disgusting."
"I am wondering what people's experience on here is that have the type of asthma that you don't wheeze.

"Hi, I am a newbies to this Reddit asthma forum, hope u help a bit on my decades road to struggle for survival. I am High allergic to dust mites on test. Please kindly enlighten me, appreciated for your enlightenment. 

I am 42-aged and my peak flow meter reading is 550 only on recent few days. I have mild ADHD, due to heavy work pressure before, I have mixed anxiety-depression disorder and on mirtazapine-duloxetine for around 2 years, and am developing liver fibrosis and fatty liver. 

My questions are here:

1. I need take my self prescribed 5-10mg melatonin to help me sleep. However- I worry it make me vulnerable to asthma. I have mild obstructive sleep apnea and am on cpap machine for two years. My public hospital asthma specialist Dr asked me to rely less on ventolin, and I have used on Relvar and Respimat for 1 year. He said I can continue my melatonin.however  The 2 inhalers start to lose effect on my. How to do? 

2. I live in Hong Kong where traffic is heavy, full of high rise buildings, often plaqued by air pollution. I had used SHARP plasma ions air purifier which seems not effective to me. I cleaned my bedding mattress every week in 60C degree hot water since I am dust mites allergic. I find hiking helps me relieve my nose allergy. My ENT Dr instructs me to rinse nose with salt water. My question is: any air purifier or air conditioner can create air, of rural countryside ozone-free PM2.5-free pollutant-free air quality, at home indoor? 

Sorry for these long wordy questions‚Ä¶ I am quite nervous most of my time."
"I was diagnosed with moderate eosinophilic asthma and have been taking my daily inhaler. This helped improve the lung function (Fev, PEF, etc.). What I noticed is that my total lung capacity is now rather low (around 82%) and the residual volume is like 50%. From what I read low TLC and RV are associated with restrictive lung disease. Do you know if Corticosteroids can also cause that (have you maybe seen it in your own spirometry)? My doctor didn‚Äôt say anything about those low values, but I wonder if I should be worried"

or do they last forever with every use? because I usually take paracetamol for migraines but it makes my asthma worse
"I'm normally fine though during the peak allergy season I do experience some coughing and wheezing. I just had a pretty bad asthma attack, but that's unusual. 

The rescue inhaler wasn't helping. though after the episode I jgot a spacer and clean the mechanism and it seems like it's more effective. 

I also bought a nebulizer but the doctor doesn't really want me to go that direction just recommends Advair.

Does this sound about right? I have an appointment with an allergist in April. My instinct is to just take advair for the next 30 days, which is usually when allergy season will end. Any help is much appreciated"
"Before I begin, Im a 20 year old Female and I never smoked. 

So back in May 2021, I had a really bad fever for about a day or two. Then I got a cough which only bothered me in the morning. Then about 3 months later, I went to the doctor wondering why its taking so long to go away. He said its cause of low blood, said my xray looks fine.

 I took the iron pills he gave but the cough still persisted. At this point, I would get coughing fits randomly. Not just in the morning. Then in December last year, I started wheezing and coughing because I laughed at someone's joke. 

I went to another doctor who looked at my xray and said that my lungs look hyperinfalted like an asthma patient. He made me do a spirometry test and it came back normal. He then gave me inhalers to use but didn't diagnose me with anything.

I started using the inhalers and a day in, I had a racing heart and got multiple panic attacks and this made me stop using them. I went to a different doctor to get a second opinion. He also said that my lungs look hyperinflated and made me get another xray and to do a total IGE test and a human comprehensive allergy test. 

He gave me montekulast tablets to use until I get my results back. I think it's helping a little? But not entirely. There's so much mucus in my throat and I keep having to clear it which then causes wheezing. I dont have shortness of breath but it's very uncomfortable. 

The things is, I'm not coughing as much but I am clearing my throat a lot. 

3 weeks later, I've still not gotten my test results back and I'm so anxious because I'm wondering if I have COPD now because of how long it's been."
"I want to preface this that I have not been diagnosed with asthma. Back to pulmonologist in May (is it asthma? GERD? both?) for chronic cough that started in 2018. And also, this is MY experience. I know a lot of people have great success and no problems with Singular. I just wish I'd known all of this years ago. 

STORY:

In an effort to help cough, I was put on Singulair late 2018. I don't know that it helped symptoms but, despite doctor saying he wasn't sure I still needed to be on it, I was afraid to go off it for fear symptoms would get worse. 

Fast forward to 2022. Because of this group or internet search or both I saw the black box warning that I wasn't notified of, or hadn't been added, when I started. 

I suffer from depression and anxiety already but it went from a 5 to a 10 during those years. I was under the care of a psychiatrist already but met with her every 3-4 months for med refills and never called her outside of that. Then I started. I'd call her late at night to schedule a phone call and this happened numerous times and just kept getting worse. 

We reviewed notes this week because I told her I had gone off of Singular and I felt like a new person. She was like AH HA. 

I literally thought of suicide 100 times per day. I was miserable at work. Kept thinking someone was breaking into my house (I NEVER worry about that). Afraid to drive. Sleeping late. Unhappy is not a strong enough word. 

All of it gone. I've gone off of anti-anxiety meds entirely. I'm engaged at work. Fears in the above gone. 

I say this just so folks can double check their mood in case they never considered Singular would impact them. 

Again, I KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE USED WITHOUT ISSUES FOR YEARS. You don't need to remind me."
"Hey i have a pretty basic question. In your experience, can asthma symptoms be present constantly throughout the day? At some points getting worse, some points very mild, but always kinda there? What is your experience with this?"
My fiance has asthma so I try not to dust to much when she's home. ( Though a deep dust would be beneficial for her overall.) She's at work all day today and Im going to dust! I have a mobile air filter that will keep the dust from just floating somewhere else but the filters pretty dirty and I can't get a new one till tomorrow. I looked it up online but all the articles were just concerned about the strain a dirty filter could be bad for the system and not so much if it could actually be doing more harm than good but it's possible they didn't include that information because it won't be more harm than good. Would anyone happen to have any input or life experience?
"Hi friends. Yesterday I was diagnosed (preliminarily) with rhinitis and bronchospasm due to cough variant asthma. I‚Äôm awaiting an X-ray, allergy test, and blood panel (to test for bird antigens). I did a spirometry test and my results were ‚Äúhighly abnormal.‚Äù 

Animals are my life and I‚Äôm very scared of what the tests will show. I have cats and a bird, and am planning to get another dog soon (mine passed last year). I grew up with a mini zoo of animals (cats, dogs, chickens, rodents, reptiles, etc) and they are my absolute passion. I‚Äôm aware that if my blood shows antigens to birds, keeping my bird could result in hypersensitivity pneumonitis and literal lung damage‚Ä¶so I‚Äôd have to rehome him. 

But cats and dogs‚Äî-I can‚Äôt do that. Again, my cats are my life. If the allergy panel shows that they‚Äôre triggering my asthma, what does that mean? Do triggers just get ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù with asthma or does exposure to triggers actually damage your lungs over time? I‚Äôm confused and scared, and don‚Äôt see my doc again until the end of May. Thank you in advance for any help. I‚Äôm overwhelmed with this and feel alone."

"I am 34 F and I've lived all over the country. My worst place is Tampa Florida. It is oak I assume that causes the issue. When oak pollen is high like it is today in Atlanta, my breathing just tightens up and I feel like I am suffocating. I get itchy everywhere and my eyes start to seal up and water. I used to be so bad as a kid. I was on steroids. Nasal steroids, aerobid, proventil, antihistamine eye drops, steroid cream for my eczema, and then oral antihistamines. Now as an adult it is way improved. During the Spring though I have a hard time breathing again and it frightens me. I have always been afraid of asthma I hate it very much. I used to ask my mom if I would die when I had to go to the hospital as a kid for treatments. I get very tight and I cant take a full breath on high pollen days. I find myself on oral antihistamines and then again I have to use rescue inhalers. If I dont have a rescue inhaler I drink a lot of coffee quickly and it makes me jittery, but it relieves that tightness in my chest. 

I have been thinking to try to see an allergist, though I have really bad marketplace insurance. So it would be out of pocket. Does anyone know how much allergy shots and testing runs? I hate feeling like this in the Spring. I think if my Spring allergies were gone I'd never need an inhaler again. I don't take one all year round. It is solely in March-May that it acts up. I try to live medicine free as much as possible. In California where I grew up I went to the Indian Clinic in Sacramento as we are Native. And they didn't do much for me then. You kind of get lost in the shuffle it isn't the best healthcare but I am very thankful for it as it kept me alive. Now as an adult though I want to do something to solve this once and for all. 

Did allergy shots help improve your life with allergies and did they improve your asthma? Would it be worth it? Does anyone know the aprx. cost? Thanks!"

"Preface: I don't know if the problem is asthma. I have family history and a risk factor (reflux) but I've never been diagnosed with a pulmonary problem... and now that I'm trying to get an answer I feel like smashing my face into a wall. I'm just hoping that maybe I'll find help from this sub's experiences. You would be the people to know.


I had COVID at the start of 2021 which I sort of think might have acted as a trigger for something. Later that spring, I started having increasing shortness of breath until I was breathing hard even just sitting at my computer. One trip to an urgent care center later I'm on Prednisone and have a generic albuterol inhaler. The inhaler frankly didn't do much, but man... The steroid was a miracle pill. Followed up with my GP and I got another week of Medrol (methylprednisolone) and a CT scan scheduled... which found nothing, because of course, good luck finding any trace of inflammation after 3 weeks of high dose steroids.

Ever since that first major incident, it's like I lost breath capacity. Air doesn't go as deep, if I want to take a *deep* breath I'm using accessory muscles and even then I feel closed-off that far down more often than not. I have better days and worse days (which the albuterol sometimes helps... a little) but it never goes all the way away.

Honestly the fact that it isn't acute is probably what makes this the most frustrating. I push for answers, doc says ""blow into the tube"" and everyone goes, Wow your numbers look fine! *No shit* my numbers are fine because I'm young and healthy with no comorbidities, I don't smoke or even live with people who do. But what the hell were my numbers before any of this? Because I sure as shit don't know! Nobody does a PFT for someone *before* there's a problem!

So I got bounced from my GP to a specialist office that kicked the can down the road for almost a year before I put my foot down. And the specialist spends two minutes in the room before he steps out and sends someone in who says *blow into the tube.* Oh, and come back in 3 months so we can follow up.

I'm just so damn frustrated I could cry. I want my breath back. I quit my old fitness routine because I was worried about getting myself worked up and then not being able to breathe. I want someone to just let me try a maintenance inhaler, or *something.* Anything.

/rant over.

If anybody has advice I'd be incredibly grateful. How to get a doctor to actually listen instead of trying to push me out the door because I'm not actively dying. Tests to ask for, questions to ask, things to say."

"Hi! I got diagnosed with moderate asthma in November and have since been on Symbicort. 

I was just wondering if anyone else with asthma finds they are able to tolerate being in the cold for long periods daily without getting sick?

Long story short I‚Äôve been stuck in an office with very cold temperatures and I find by the weekend I‚Äôm sick. Before I was diagnosed I didn‚Äôt get sick as often so I‚Äôm just wondering if that‚Äôs a common occurrence. 

Thanks!"
"Hello everyone, I am 23 years old and never had asthma before (was never diagnosed) although my allergies where always high since I was a kid.

In January I had Covid-19 and in the weeks after I noticed that my breathing was strange, and in the following weeks it started to get progressivly harder to breathe and currently I still have shortness of breath.

After a while I started to feel my throat getting tigher and at the moment this symptom is still present, it also feels like there is a rock in the bottom of my thoat. I haven't experienced any coughing.

  
My sister is a doctor and recomended me getting a CAT Scan to see if there was damage or irregularities in my lungs  which there weren't.  
I also did a blood test and everything was well, except for the allergy values which where very high.  
I am currently doing allergy medication and  corticosteroid inhaler but my chest still hurts and my throat is still tight.

Does this appear to be a case of asthma? I have an appointment next week for my throat and in a month I will do some breathing tests. Thank you for your answers."
"So... I've never had asthma to begin with, but a good chunk of my family have it, my 2 sisters and my mom, while my dad and my 2 brothers don't have it.

Until now (25 yo) I've always been allergic to pollen but it was never asthma, rather cough, burning eyes etc... And 2 weeks ago, I started having trouble breathing, when to emergency they litterally told me to go back home despite the fact I was dizzy and white as fuck. Cause they had too much covid patients and couldn't take anyone else that wasn't an absolute emergency. I managed somehow until recently where it has gotten worse and worse, to the point my heart was becoming painful.

So I give in an took the inhalator my mom gave me (I wouldn't take it at first because no docs haven't seen me yet, they are all full and I was pretty sure I couldnt get asthma late.) So I took a breath yesterday and managed to sleep like a baby thanks to that.

But today it's getting even worse to the point I had to take 2 breath of inhalator and it didn't fixed completely this time (even though I have the feeling I'm not taking it correctly ?)

My question is, does my asthma will goes away after April ? I don't feel like I can keep up that way, I feel like I'm breathing manually for  2weeks straight, in the exception of yesterday night."
"I recently changed insurance and Symbicort is any where from $700 - $1000. Pretty much every other combination inhaler except generic Advair diskus is equally expensive, but I've always had trouble using the disk shaped inhalers. I was wondering if there were other medications I should look into until I can get back on Symbicort."
"yesterday i was laughing quite a bit . i noticed i started coughing easily and feeling breathless . i have had an asthma attack from laughing before but that was when my coughing was totally out of control . i also noticed i was feeling light headed as well same thing i had when i had the asthma attack last time , i also had chest pain but soon as i felt it coming on i made myself stop laughing . anyone else get these symptoms from laughing ?"
"Hi, i was wondering if your lungs have an adjustment time for new medicine. Im 27 and i‚Äôve been an asthma patient since i was 2. I started taking serotide diskus 500mg twice a day for the last 3 years and my condition was mostly stabilized. My doctor suggested 3 days ago that i should decrease the dosage to 250mg twice a day. This is my third day on it and im starting to get minor symptoms of asthma like chest tightness. Is it normal when you decrease the dosage of your medicine? Im on a trial period for 3 months."

"For a few months now I have been experiencing adverse symptoms following exertion, including: shortness of breath / bronchospasm, left chest feeling of tightness / pressure. My initial thought and concern was some kind of heart issue. However, after a very thorough heart examination consisting of Stress Echocardiogram + EKG, my doctor believes that I am experiencing exercise induced asthma. I'm not familiar with asthma or what it is supposed to feel like, and this might just be me being overly anxious / stressed about it, but I can't shake the feeling that the pressure is cardiac related.

When I bring this up to my doctor, he states that I am overthinking and stressing myself out, because my Stress Echo + EKG were good. I want to believe him but when I get chest tightness / pressure after taking a shower, or going out for a walk... I can't help but worry. I have been given an Albuterol inhaler to try 30 minutes before exercise."

I'm going to be setting up a visit to talk with my Dr about coming off Dupixent. My eyes are terribly dry and I just can't take it anymore. I'm curious if anyone knows how this transition process works? Will I have to wait a long time before taking the next drug?
"Do any of you have agreement with your pulmonologist to increase doses on your own when you feel like you need to? I basically have deal with my doctor, that if I feel worse to use my inhaler more (Symbicort, powder ICS).

Problem is this is new medicine. Before I was using Alvesco and I would just take more puffs if I felt my asthma was worse and I'd use Ventolin when needed. But Symbicort is my only treatment now and I am supposed to use it both as rescue and as control inhaler.

I am taking it one puff twice a day (in the morning and evening). In past few days allergies are at its highest (for pollen I am allergic to) and even with antihistamine and everything else my breathing is not good. My peak flow is lower and I have chest tightness. It gets better when I take Symbicort so I used it 3 times a day about 2 - 3 times in past 10 days.

Now my question is, should I increase my Symbicort dose to 2 puffs twice a day because of allergies, or continue 1 puff twice a day and additional puff when I feel the need?

I ask because I am new to this medicine (only used it for a month), and I don't know what is best way to use it. Instructions say you can take it 2 puffs twice a day and my doc told me same thing."
"So, I coughed really hard and multiple times a day every day because of asthma and sometimes I just kind of force it to get it out. But I came across something that kind of freaked me out, and it was that harsh coughing can cause a Mallory Weiss tear in your esophagus or a hole in your esophagus and it just really bothers me."
"Before elaborating - I am seeing a pulmonologist soon. I‚Äôm in the middle of switching my insurance.

Im not sure if it‚Äôs asthma yet, as I haven‚Äôt been officially diagnosed. But for a couple years now I‚Äôve dealt with shortness of breath, and ignored it at first because it came and went and was never really that bothersome. Last winter, I noticed it got worse and I went to the doctor and she gave me Flovent and Albuterol. Albuterol has never worked for me, I swear it just makes me feel worse. I WISH it worked. Flovent seemed to help but I did still feel the shortness of breath often. 

Last summer it got SO bad. Again, no wheezing coughing chest tightness, just throat tightness as if someone was putting so much pressure on my throat. 

 I finally got a new inhaler (symbicort) but have yet to notice any changes. It‚Äôs been a week (I understand you need to wait a couple weeks atleast), but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if this is asthma. I‚Äôm basically just curious if anyone else has experienced something similar. I assume it‚Äôs asthma since that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been treating it as for the past year."

"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking around to see what the current scientific consensus is on chronic fatigue in people with asthma and I've noticed that chronic fatigue is considered very prevalent amongst our group, especially in partially and uncontrolled asthma. Simultaneously it's talked about the least. A quick search of this subreddit seems to kinda confirm that as I've found very little posts about chronic fatigue in relation to asthma and no posts on the topic in recent times.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, the fatigue is my worst symptom in my overall health, but simultaneously it's a symptom that can have so many different causes, making it difficult to deal with it's actors.

&amp;#x200B;

So firstly, I'm wondering if you also experience a form of above average chronic fatigue? And secondly and perhaps more importantly, did you find anything that helps in combating this fatigue?"
"Got no real career options left anymore , and absolutely hate my job so thought I‚Äôd try the military. Only problem is, I‚Äôve got asthma on my record (it‚Äôs long enough ago that it won‚Äôt affect my entry).

Additionally, any tips on improving my peak flow (other than increasing the amount of cardio I do), as they‚Äôll make my do a peak flow to make sure I don‚Äôt have asthma anymore.

"Hey everyone so I didn‚Äôt know where to share this or how to even approach this. I don‚Äôt know if this matters too but I‚Äôm a girl and I‚Äôm 23. I made a throw away acc just to be safe too.

On Thursday (March, 24th, 2022) my mom got me a primatene mist inhaler to try since I have really bad asthma. I got Covid at the beginning of the year and it made my asthma worse so she wanted me to try it out. I did everything the instructions said and it say to do two puffs of it and instantly I felt weird.

Instantly I got light headed, my head was spinning, couldn‚Äôt focus on anything, couldn‚Äôt talk, my body went numb, my heart was racing horribly it felt like it was gonna pop, I couldn‚Äôt walk, I had tremors I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking and my voice was trembling, I couldn‚Äôt breathe and kept coughing, etc.

It felt like I was about to have a heart attack and a stroke at the same time (no I‚Äôm not over exaggerating). I told my mom and we instantly went to the ER. We told then everything and the nurse was surprised when we told her it was primatene she went on telling us they discontinued it for that very reason and some famous actress died from it?? Later on we read more into it and the labeling and it just kept getting worse.

It‚Äôs been a couple days now I still have some side effects from it my heart keeps hurting on and off and I‚Äôm having even worse breathing issues now. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to approach this my family and friends keep saying to sue or get a attorney but I just wanna spread the word to let people know. 
Maybe it was just me or a reaction i had to it.
Thank you and be safe everyone!

[EDIT!!!!]
I am aware that this does work for people and not everyone has had reactions like this to this brand. I'm not posting this for attention or so I could ""take them down"" I'm posting this to warn people and for people with asthma to know as a heads up that's all. Thank you!"
"Okay so last night i couldn't sleep because my nose was stuffed and my chest hurt and i couldn't breathe, i tossed and turned until 5am and decided to get my inhaler and nasal spray that the doctor gave me i could find my regular red inhaler so i wind up using the emergency blue inhaler and nasal spray, got a cup of water and tried my best to go back to sleep, it got worse from there and I'm currently trying to explain to my parents that even going outside isn't helping but they won't listen to me because their natural paths and hate doctors...i feel a scratchy pain in my lungs/chest and I've been gasping for air all day...what do i do?"

"Hi there! Does anyone know any good power banks? that work good with a nebulizer? My little brother has severe asthma so it doesn't help when he has to wait 20-45 minutes for us to drive home or longer for him to get his treatment. I've been looking into getting a power bank that I can keep on me so I can just plug in the treatment for him whereever we are. I saw that there's car adapter ones but I think the power bank is more useful since it can be carried around. 

TLDR; Looking for power bank that can work &amp; last well with nebulizer treatments for on the go."
"I am currently using Budesonide as a preventive inhaler, twice per day. I also have exercised-induced asthma, and so, my doctor has recommended that I use the rescue inhaler before doing exercise.

I would like to ask anybody using rescue inhaler before exercise how do you use it and mix it up with the preventive inhaler? I generally do strenous exercise in the late afternoon, and so, I use the rescue inhaler before exercise and then use the preventive inhaler before going to sleep. But, what if I exercise in the morning? Do I use the preventive inhaler and the rescue inhaler in the morning at the same time? What system do you employ to combine the two inhalers when doing exercise?"

"Anybody tried this?
I recently managed to try this out when I was heavily congested and it helped loads
Far better than otc decongestant 
I recently had a review with an asthma nurse in the uk and was point blank refused the option of getting them on prescription was told there only for people with copd 
I was told just to use antibiotics which I never want or use, the end result is usually I can be gobbing up snot for 6 weeks but with carbocisteine it clears up in no time"
I recently started smoking white sage after reading sage can be smoked and is legal and non addictive. I read that it has anti inflammatory properties and wanted to know how this could affect me long term. I only do this like once a week and my asthma is pretty damn mild
I had a positive covid test around 8 days ago now and I had mild symptoms for the most part. What‚Äôs lingering is my difficulty breathing. My chest feels tight and I‚Äôm constantly yawning. I have a small pulse ox at home and it never reads below 96 but I still feel like I can‚Äôt breathe. I have mild asthma so I have been using my rescue albuterol inhaler but it doesn‚Äôt help as much as I want. I can‚Äôt sleep anymore because I jolt awake gasping and panicking that I don‚Äôt have enough air. Did anyone else experience this and find something that worked? Are there different types of meds I should take besides albuterol or should I ask my doctor for a nebulizer? I‚Äôm desperate to get good sleep and breathe normally again.
"Hello I have had this issue for about two years now and I am finally getting it checked because it has become a bigger problem and I realized that it wasn't from just my cigarette smoking (I quit about 5 months ago)

Anyways I get shortness of breath and chest pain a lot. I have gotten an EKG done, and a CT scan of my chest, however the CT scan was quite a while ago now, but both came back completely fine.

I was prescribed an inhaler by my doc until we can do further testing, I have an xray on Thursday, and a pulmonary function test scheduled next month, but he does suspect asthma.

The thing is this is such a constant issue that my anxiety often thinks I have lung cancer or something. It is almost like in my mind asthma can't be this constant and overbearing right? 

The inhaler has been a lifesaver, it is an emergency inhaler and everytime I have used it, it has helped to varying degrees my shortness of breath and chest pains. Sometimes it would be pretty surprising how much I felt like I could breathe, felt almost like my lungs had unlimited space and I realized I am kinda always short of breath, just not severe enough to notice. I am not sure if it was something like say lung cancer if an albuterol inhaler would work with that as well?

However other times it helps just a bit, I will still have this feeling of almost like liquid in my throat and I have to constantly clear it and I cough a lot. But the shortness of breath always dissapears and my lung capacity always improves after using the inhaler.

Anyways I am a bit worried, when I was a kid I would cough real bad after running, and whenever I got sick it was a good 5-6 months of constantly coughing. I was given an inhaler as a kid but never used it because my mom was afraid of me using it for some reason, and to be honest it wasn't thaaat bad, I was just hacking up a storm.

As an adult it feels pretty bad, and that has me super nervous that it could be a million different and deadly things with my lungs. Anyone here have any comforting words or relate to the issues I am having?

Sorry if this post is long, needed to vent about my anxieties."
"Okay, to be fair, I'm not sure if it's the atrovent or the allegra I'm taking.  But I'm having constant heart palpitations.  My heart just feels like it's fluttering all the time.  And my resting HR is about 10 bpm higher than it normally is.

I don't know if my breathing issues are due to asthma.  I've been tested and it shows mild asthma, but that's always been the case for me.  The breathing problems I'm having now, are new.  And I've tried numerous inhalers.  I've been on Atrovent now for a week 3x a day.  No improvement whatsoever.

Anyway, just curious if anybody else experiences heart fluttering.  It's kind of freaking me out."
"After workouts I start coughing and feel short of breath, and is kinda painful. Plus, even after running for a few seconds I gasp for air and pant more than a dog who ran a marathon."
I am using a personal best peak flow meter. I used it when my breathing felt okay. It ended up being around 640-650. I took it again today when my breathing felt tight and it‚Äôs around 500-520. Would this probably be a good time to take albuterol inhaler?
"Long story short I smoked dabs and have been wheezing and having trouble breathing for 2ish weeks. Went to urgent care twice and they prescribed me prednisone and an albuterol inhaler. I finished both prescriptions and the wheeze still persists. The prednisone does help. Sometimes Albuterol doesn't help the wheeze sometimes it does. 

I stopped smoking March 12 and have a Dr appointment tomorrow morning. If you guys could pray for my lungs it would be much appreciated. My anxiety is through the roof. I wake up at least once a night wheezing and more if I don't take the prednisone. 

I know you guys aren't doctors I'm just trying to see if anyone else has gone through something like this. Thanks for reading."

"It was the worst asthma attack I‚Äôve ever had by far. I couldn‚Äôt even sit upright without being very dizzy. I was trying to catch my breath and hyperventilating. I think for a sec there I thought I was going to die. I think I was wheezing and coughing and definitely yawning a lot.

I was absolutely terrified.

But because I have PTSD I don‚Äôt believe myself or I think it was just a huge panic attack for no reason. I‚Äôve never had a panic attack like that that lasted that long or made me feeling like I was trying to catch my breath.

I feel stupid for blowing it out of proportion but simultaneously not taking it seriously enough."
"Do these go away over time? Just started singular last night and had a very dark, disturbing dream. Going to give it time but curious people‚Äôs experience if this fades after awhile?"
"So last week I had a probably moderate asthma attack while doing my squat. Immediately stopped and went home. And suddenly i was gasping for air. It was so bad, i needed to go to the ER. 

Long story short, i was admitted and they did all tests possible. MRI CT on my lungs and heart for example. All came back good. Structure wise all good. Blood test also good. Troponin levels all good. 

But my lung doctor told me that I exhaled more than I inhaled (the amount of air). She told me that thats my body still recovering. 

But see heres the thing. Im at home now resting. But i still feel tightness in my chest sometimes, hard to breathe too. And feeling very very super tired. 

Is this normal? Well Its only been a week but you know .. maybe im freaking out too? So add that to my recovery üò™"
"Hey guys I need your input on something, I recently moved to Colorado from California and have been trying to get used to the altitude and dry air but it seems like I have to take an extra breath especially when walking up stairs (I love on the 3rd floor) I feel so out of shape and I actually am but anyway last night I was carrying up some groceries and I was struggling to catch my breath I had to sit down a bunch of times. I felt a strong squeezing feeling in my throat (I‚Äôve experienced this before) I heard it might be exercise induced asthma. The last time I had bad asthma was when I was 5 (I‚Äôm 25 now) I thought I grew out of it? Or do you have asthma forever once you get it once?"

"Hey wheezy gang.

About 1.5 years ago, I had sudden onset dyspnea after what is believed to be a viral bronchitis infection. Due to the pandemic, it took 6 months to get a spirometry, and after 6 months of suffering (and really struggling to consistently take my medications because of my job), was told that my spirometry was normal, so there shouldn't be anything wrong. I left my first pulmonology appointment with a prescription for fucking nasal spray.

Soon after that, I left my job, because it was very physical and I just couldn't keep doing it. It gave me the opportunity to finally take me medicine consistently, and it really didn't help. I went back to my pulmonologist and asked for a methacholine reflex test, because I felt like I was just dropped into an asthma diagnosis with no real proof I even have asthma. She ordered one, and I attended.

The results were probably the worst thing possible: we still don't know. She said my airways ""technically reacted"", so I *do* have asthma like everyone is saying I have, but that whatever is causing my dyspnea *isn't* asthma related. She still continued her line of ""let's try ICS"", which is fair, because there was a medication I had to stop due to finances that I felt like did help for the 1 month I was taking it. The results of the test gave me wiggle room to ask for more testing, and she ordered blood work (allergies, ANA, among others) and a chest x-ray. Everything came back unremarkable, save for the ANA test, which she said was likely unremarkable as well due to a very very low titer. I asked for a referral to them because it literally all I have to go on.

I'm becoming more fatigued over time, even though I'm not working a regular job anymore, and my mental health is really taking a toll, which affects my physical health, and turns into a vicious cycle. My dyspnea specifically has gotten better over time, but it setting harder to do basic duties, namely taking care of my dog, which I take very seriously.

My PCP is a nurse staffed clinic, and they know me really well, so I'm considering booking an appt with them to discuss it and maybe find a different kind of specialist since it's unlikely this is significantly caused by my asthma. Do y'all think this warrants a 2nd opinion?"
"Hi all. New to this whole faulty lung thing. I‚Äôm 27f, and back in December I started having coughing episodes that made it very difficult to breathe, wheezing, and a crackling sound in my lungs when I inhaled. The inside of my chest felt itchy. That‚Äôs literally the only way I know to describe it. I went to urgent care. The NP said I sounded constricted, and prescribed singulair, prednisone, and antibiotics. No chest X-ray. I got a little better for a couple weeks and then went right back to the coughing and occasional wheezing with chest tightness. Cold air made it instantly worse. Drinking warm stuff helped a lot. 

I then went to my primary. She also said I sounded constricted and prescribed albuterol and said if I didn‚Äôt get better to come back. Well, I was supposed to use albuterol every four hours, but it was getting to a point at times where I had to use it like every 2 hours or so because I had bad shortness of breath and coughing so hard I would puke. 

So I went back to my primary this month. She did a chest X-ray which was normal. She did a spirometer test which literally no one has given me results for even though I asked twice. One nurse said the results weren‚Äôt even in my chart. Whatever. She also prescribed me Flovent and refilled the albuterol. I‚Äôm also still on singulair and Benadryl as needed. But the word ‚Äúasthma‚Äù has been thrown around by both of my primary NP‚Äôs, and I‚Äôm to follow up with them in a month. I don‚Äôt know what this follow up is for? I don‚Äôt know if they wanna assess me and refer me to somebody? 

I guess my question is what‚Äôs the process here? How did you get diagnosed and what were your symptoms like? I imagine everyone is different. Like, are these coughing fits ‚Äúattacks‚Äù or just a product of irritation? What kind of stuff do I need to look for? Should I be afraid? I mean I have a pulse ox and my O2 is always good after these fits. But I‚Äôm still occasionally using albuterol after the Flovent and still feeling the tight, ‚Äúitchy‚Äù feeling in my chest. 

Anybody got the spoons to give me a good run down of their experience? Thank you so much!"

"Photo of inhalers: https://ibb.co/zbWXgmq

My GF doesn't have asthma, just has an inhaler in case of an emergency. Hasn't needed it in over 2yrs but suddenly needed it last night. It wasn't being very effective so she borrowed a friend's for the night. Today she realized she doesn't know which is which.

The only difference is that date you can see there. However, my GF's inhaler is years old, so I don't know why hers has a 2021 date on it at all. Also, are those dates the expiration dates? Everything else is the same as far as she can see (I'm remotely helping her).

She's now having more attacks because she thinks if she gives her friend back the wrong inhaler it might kill her because it's not as effective (we know the old one isn't dangerous, just less effective).

Is there any other way to tell them apart aside from those dates?"
"19/f - I‚Äôve had asthma my whole life and got covid in January. While I had covid I made a dumb mistake of smoking weed and it really ruined my lungs. I‚Äôve been to the hospital, seen specialists, done x-rays and blood work, I‚Äôve also maxed out on prednisone and my inhalers hardly work. 
I‚Äôm starting to give up and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone knows any natural remedies or tips that can help me get better.
My main problem is coughing up phlegm and wheezing - any advice will help!"
I was recently diagnosed with covid and was advised to take my albuterol inhaler regularly by my doctor as I was experiencing shortness of breath. I also have a stuffy nose so I took some Afrin nose spray but now I can‚Äôt stop shaking and I feel anxious and awful. Has anyone had this before? Is there any way to make it stop?
"I'm 22 and I've smoked weed maybe around 15 times over the last 5 years and the next day after smoking I usually get a sharp pain in my back near the lungs when I do certain movements. Yesterday I took 3 hits out of a joints and today I've been feeling that small pain on and off. When I vape I never get that pain.
 
I know I shouldn't be smoking weed, but I really like to smoke for music festivals. The problem is I can't bring my vape in there because it's still illegal in my country.

 I also don't want to take edibles because I don't want to risk getting too high from homemade ones. Am I playing with fire by smoking sometimes, if I have this pain? I don't mind the pain, it doesn't hurt much, but usually pain is not a good sign."
"Recently I‚Äôve had a horrible asthma exacerbation and finally visited a pulmonologist and she told me to keep using Relvar 100mcg but also added montelukast 10mg. I‚Äôm worried that she suddenly gave me that rather than 5mg and I‚Äôm also worried about the side effects like depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts etc cause I‚Äôm already at high risk for those

Are the side effects common? Also is it bad to suddenly use 10mg rather than titrating it?"
"I've been having issues getting my Symbicort filled through Walgreens (New England) the last 6 months. It takes 2-3 weeks for the pharmacy to get it in stock every single time. The last time I ran out and had to substitute with my nebulizer and an old Flovent I had hanging around and it wasn't a great solution.

Is anyone else having this problem? I'm wondering if it's a supply issue with Symbicort itself or a pharmacy issue."
"I‚Äôm in the US, I‚Äôve been on Breo Ellipta for years and I love it. Every other medication didn‚Äôt keep my asthma under control. I was in the hospital frequently and always using my rescue inhaler. Breo really changed my life. My copay used to be $75 but it increased to $130 last few months. Just yesterday, I went to pick it up and it was $375. That‚Äôs a lot for 30 day supply! Breo good rx coupons are just as crazy. This is with insurance just a copay. My insurance is tied with work and quite expensive already. I take Sea Moss, exercise regularly &amp; cut back on dairy. Anything else I could be doing? I‚Äôm just a little overwhelmed and looking for any advice. Is there a more affordable way to get my medication?"
"To make a long story short, my 3 dogs have been with my parents for the last two years while I have been in nursing school. Now we are having a baby and although I graduated I haven‚Äôt had time to start working or save up so we will be staying with my parents until we can get our own place, 6 months to one year from now. (My boyfriend is allergic to dust, pollen, and pet dander). 

My boyfriend also has his own dog, although hypoallergenic (a yorkie). My dogs are not hypoallergenic. 

We just stayed 5 days with my parents to test it out and he felt a little short of breath pretty much the entire time, but that was without any of the strategies I am willing to take on to help him feel comfortable living there. To be honest, the house was extremely dusty and the dogs had gone without a bath in probably a month. 

Boyfriends current medicines:
- advair
- montekulast 
- xyztal 
- Flonase 
- saline nose spray 
- he also had completed one full round of allergy shots 10 years ago

The house:
- there is no carpet or upholstery anywhere, everything is wood, tile, or leather. 
- plan to have an air purifier in every room 
- all dogs off limits to bedroom and bathroom 
- looking into having the air ducts cleaned, this has never been done
- getting hepa air filter for AC 

Laundry:
- we wash all of our clothes separately and in hot water 

And the cleaning regimen:

Daily: 
- Vacuum 1x
- dry Mop - microfiber 1x
- Roomba 2x - AM&amp;PM 
- Spray allergen spray 
- Air purifiers on 24/7 

Weekly:
- Clean air purifiers 
- Clean roomba 
- Change bed sheets 
- Wash dog bedding 
- Clean bathroom 
- Wipe couches 
- Wet mop 
- Dust everywhere - fans, baseboards, etc 

Monthly: 
- Change air filter 

Dogs: 
- dog allergy shampoo
- Dog allergy spray 
- Dog deodorizing spray 
- Bathe weekly 


Any other tips, tricks, or suggestions?"

"Hello Friends! I am wondering to start Chinese medicine &amp; acupuncture for my asthma. I am currently on  seebri Breezhaler once daily, Symbicort twice daily two puffs together with my rescue inhaler. My asthma has been really active for the past 6 months and got worse since I had covid in Jan 2022. I got really concerned for the amount of medication + steroid I am taking and it seems working but still, I have heavy chest flare up everyday when I woke up. I am thinking to get acupuncture some herbal Chinese medicine on top of my asthma. Eventually, I want to use only rescue inhaler when necessary. Do you guys have any experience or any thought about this?  Really appreciated for your time ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"I used to have sever asthma as a kid, but I don't have any symptom at all since I was 10. I'm 22 now. Even though I don't have symptoms, I know that asthma is a life-long illness so I technically still have it. 

I've vaped weed in the past and it never caused me problems, but because weed is not legal in my country, it's risky to go out with a vape (thanks war on drugs!). 

I've also smoked a few times out of joints and usually if I only have 5 or 6 small hits my lungs are ok the next day. As long as my lungs don't hurt the next day, is it ok to smoke once a week when I go out to clubs?"
"Hello, I recently got prescribed the Advair Diskus inhaler (not for asthma, but for a condition called POTS). I noticed the directions are very specific on saying that doses must be taken at least 12 hours apart, and no more than 2 doses may be taken within 24 hours.

My question is: how strict is this? I work full time as a 911 dispatcher, so my work shifts can vary from 3am-3pm, 11am-11pm, 6am-6pm. I‚Äôm not awake at the same time every day to take the medication exactly 12 hours apart some days. 

For instance, today I‚Äôm taking the inhaler at 10am and 10pm. But tomorrow I work 6am-6pm and have to sleep right after work for a 3am shift the following day. Would it be okay to take the medication at 6am and 6pm tomorrow, although I‚Äôve taken it at 10am and 10pm today? 

I‚Äôm calling my doctor‚Äôs office and pharmacy when they open later today to discuss it, but I just wanted to see if everyone else takes it at the exact time every day or if it‚Äôs a bit flexible. I‚Äôve never been on any inhalers before so I‚Äôm new to all of this. Thank you in advance"
"Hi ! So about two weeks ago I started having a flare up with my asthma (little bit of wheezing, no coughing) My asthma usually gets triggered around when allergy season starts up. Not sure if worth mentioning but I did have mild Covid back in December. I have a rescue inhaler which wasn‚Äôt doing much. So my dr prescribed me prednisone which seem to help initially but, still wheezing in right lung, then she prescribed me a daily inhaler to use twice a day last week. (Advair 100/50) I‚Äôve only been using the Advair for 3 days so far and I was wondering how long will it take before Advair starts to help?  I‚Äôve just never been hit this hard with allergy season still hurts to breathe, chest feels heavy, and a little shortness of breath which isn‚Äôt unusual. I also have bad anxiety so that doesn‚Äôt help at all. I‚Äôm taking singular, Flonase, zyrtec, and advair.  Please tell me this is normal for asthmaüò≠ I‚Äôm struggling or if anyone has any tips that would be great.  TIA!"
"Is cyanosis (blue lips/fingertips) the only barometer to measure the flare severity?

How many rescue inhaler puffs before an asthmatic having a flare should go to Urgent Care?"
"So my gp concluded I have Asthma (non allergic I think, they didn't tell me) some time back and prescribed me a fostor nexthaler (100/6)
The medicine clearly states that it's only for people above the age of 18 on the packaging yet I am 16 and got it prescribed. my mom said that it would be fine because the doctors know what they do but I am still not sure if this is safe

So does anyone know why it's 18+ and if it's safe to use for me?"
Did some spirometry tests at asthma doctor last week and my lungs are a lot weaker than expected after the tests. My asthma is because of my cat allergies and my roommate has a cat. Should I be concerned and do you think it‚Äôll lower over time through training and not being around allergens?
"Hey everyone so I didn‚Äôt know where to share this at or even approach this it‚Äôs been 2 days now. I don‚Äôt know if this matters too but I‚Äôm a girl and I‚Äôm 23.

On Thursday (March, 24th, 2022) my mom got me a primatene mist inhaler to try since I have really bad asthma. I got Covid at the beginning of the year and it made my asthma worse so she wanted me to try it out. I did everything the instructions said and it say to do two puffs of it and instantly I felt weird.

Instantly I got light headed, my head was spinning, couldn‚Äôt focus on anything, couldn‚Äôt talk, my body went numb, my heart was racing horribly it felt like it was gonna pop, I couldn‚Äôt walk, I had tremors I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking and my voice was trembling, I couldn‚Äôt breathe and kept coughing, etc.

It felt like I was about to have a heart attack and a stroke at the same time (no I‚Äôm not over exaggerating). I told my mom and we instantly went to the ER. We told then everything and the nurse was surprised when we told her it was primatene she went on telling us they discontinued it for that very reason and some famous actress died from it?? Later on we read more into it and the labeling and it just kept getting worse.

It‚Äôs been two days now I still have some side effects from it my heart keeps hurting on and off and I‚Äôm having even worse breathing issues now. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to approach this my family and friends keep saying to sue or get a attorney but I just wanna spread the word to let people know. 
Maybe it was just me or a reaction i had to it 
But if you have severe asthma please please please be careful with it if this ties back to me or could get me in trouble please let me know! Thank you everyone and please stay safe out there."
"Hi. I‚Äôm a 16 year old fairly healthy boy, but I‚Äôve suffered pretty moderately bad asthma throughout my life. I‚Äôve been able to cope pretty well but I noticed going to my grandparents house that it‚Äôs really bad there. It‚Äôs much more in terms of wheeze than cough, a massive, painful amount of wheeze and it‚Äôs a massive problem to my sleep and general well-being there. As I‚Äôve been going there every weekend for pretty much 8 years, there isn‚Äôt much I can do to avoid it. I‚Äôve had a long term bad allergy history but any advice on what it might be and why it might be? I go to other dusty and old areas but I have no problem at all, and even when coming back to my house after I‚Äôve been there for 1 night it takes at least a day for my breathing to return normally. Any advice or help would be appreciated. Any questions would also be answered :)"

"I was recently on the course of prednisone that starts off at 60 mg and over the course of about 2 weeks. I was not really warned about the mental health side effects. The first several days I actually felt great overall and then began to have some scary symptoms such as massive brain fog, symptoms of psychosis (I‚Äôve experienced it before so I knew that‚Äôs what it was), and extremely violent dreams. I reached out to the doctor and they told me to take one 10 mg dose that day and then stop. I also went to the walk in and they reassured me that I just need to taper off and rest and that my symptoms were normal but they personally would not have put me on such a high dose due to my weight and height. That was yesterday and over 24 hours ago at this point. I feel much better today than I felt yesterday but still feel very off and occasionally having moments where the way I feel mentally is scaring me. I had really bad pains in my ears and head yesterday and those have gone away but it was still strange and uncomfortable. 

I know most m of you are not doctors but I would just like to hear your experiences/advice. Im a little upset that especially with my mental health history, i was not really warned about the side effects. I have a part time job that is physical and was feeling really paranoid during my shift yesterday. I‚Äôm supposed to go in tomorrow and I really hate calling out unless I absolutely need to but I don‚Äôt want to risk having a freak out at work. I‚Äôm still experiencing a rapid heart beat. Wondering how long these symptoms typically last and if anyone has any advice on how to cope during this sensitive time."

"I never get thrust with symbicourt but it isn't controlling myastham so I am switching to zenhale. I have tried two times and both times I get oral thrust right away, if I remember correctly this also happened with Flovent HFA.

I use a spacer, I rinse and gargle, I use salt water. still happens. I do have scared up ugly tonsils so sometimes I wonder if they catch the particles.

is this something that if I keep with the puffer will go away ?"
"I've been having swallowing problem since I developed asthma. Sometimes it is barely noticeable, sometimes it is pretty bad. 

It kind of feels like dry throat that never goes away, feels mucous stuck on the walls of your throat. At one point, during the exacerbation it was so bad that I used to choke on the phlegm.  Couldn't lie down on the flat surface. 

Anyways, I always seem to have it. I am pretty sure it is the asthma thing. Anybody else having the same issue?"
"Hi,  
As a kid I remember being short of breath, but was doing sports and playing trumpet, and symptoms disappeared when I was a teen. At 20 i smoked cigarettes for 4 years and after quitting due to SOB I used to vaporize weed for 10 more years until SOB came back again. At 34 I quit everything, but had sensitive lungs onwards with SOB on and off. Now at 40 I finally identified the triggers, its any type of exhaust fumes from larger vehicles. Even small inhalation causes severe SOB for weeks, but always fades away overtime until I'm exposed again to it. Rescue inhaler(Albuterol) helps a little, but not a real relief.   


I went to pulmonologist and did Lung function test as well as Chest Xray and no issues were observed.   Doctor said my breath is normal and could be anxiety. A year later now I'm going to see him again as symptoms are severe whenever I inhale even small amount of exhaust fumes during walk outside, and  beside severe SOB have this deathy feelings in the lungs(not exactly pain but inability to breath + nasty irritation - terrible feeling!). I dont wheeze, cough, and blood oxygen level is 97.   


Could anyone please advise what it could be what questions should I ask. Should I ask for Flovent or Advair to mitigate SOB? Perhaps more tests to take? Would appreciate your comments. It's been incredibly difficult to pinpoint the root cause given that I dont have cough, wheezing and that albuterol doesnt really help?"
"Hello 26 A here. I‚Äôve been going through a lot. As far as trying to get my environment together which has been triggering my asthma terribly. I did a few renovations (removing my carpet, repairing the chipping paint) but still have work to do. My partner also has a dog that does in fact stay at a distance from me. Also found out after removing my carpet there was mold in my bedroom. So I was able to finally get a date to get it fixed coming up shortly. My pulmonologist prescribed me with singulair &amp; flucticasone propionate &amp; salmeterol inhalation powder, around October 2021. It works well but the side effects are a horrid. Singulair causes me to have the most vivid &amp; bazaar dreams it leaves me waking up feeling anxious. To the point where I deprive myself of rest. That along with the inhaler has caused my face specifically my cheeks to break out terribly. Is that steroid acne?  
My face looks red often &amp; inflamed. I‚Äôve been trying a lot of different facial cleanser but nothing is really working. 
I went vegan awhile ago hoping that will help &amp; it has to an extent.

I also underwent a tremendous amount of stress losing family members due to the unfortunate virus. It‚Äôs been awful trying to cope. Stressful to say the least. Does anyone have advice on how I can get my acne to a minimum? I‚Äôm okay with a pimple here &amp; there but my cheeks look very inflamed at this point. I can‚Äôt even look in the mirror it makes me depressed.

Also, can anyone recommend a good air purifier? 

Thank you to those taking the time to read this &amp; respond. Any help or advice will be genuinely appreciated."
Anyone been prescribed Prednisone for asthma ?
"I‚Äôve always had issues with coughing after vigorous exercises or walking outside in the cold. Also, every time I laugh too hard I have a cough attack..

Recently I had a cold and now all of this seems to have worsened. At night my chest gets very tight but it‚Äôs better by the time I wake up. Also, after exercising I don‚Äôt feel like I *need* my rescue inhaler but I definitely am uncomfortable and have to focus on my breathing for a while for my chest to feel less tight and cough-y. It‚Äôs mostly a dry cough.

Is Asthma actually manageable? I'm so scared for my daughter that she won't have a normal life.
"Whenever I do ‚Äúbouncy‚Äù cardio workouts (running especially, lots of jumping‚Ä¶high impact I guess is what I‚Äôm trying to describe) I get this searing pain in what feels like my oesophagus but might be at the top of my lungs, the wheezing starts and I can‚Äôt catch my breath for ages afterwards. It‚Äôs so painful! I can easily do 45 mins of Pilates or Barre daily, and about 15 mins of no/low impact HIIT or Tabata without this weird burning pain developing. 

I have had asthma since I was a child and I have exercise-induced asthma as well, but I just want to know whether this symptom is due to me being unfit or whether this is part of my asthma? I‚Äôm quite slim - only mentioning this because it might be relevant. 

I‚Äôd really love to improve my cardio, but I don‚Äôt know if I need to just push through this pain or whether it‚Äôs to do with my asthma and I need to stick to low/no-impact cardio?"

I'm just wondering what to think.we have been to the Dr and they say she doesn't have Asthhma but she had this night time cough last summer that lasted weeks finally they tried a different antibiotic and it went away. Now this cough is back 6 months later (after a recent cold) only times she coughs is when she is about to go to bed. Once she is sleep she doesn't cough again. I'm confused. We have another appointment soon but I'm just unsure if a lingering chest infection can only cause a her to cough a few times before bed. She is completely fine during the day.
"Hey guys,

I'm fighting off a sinus infection right now. And I'm reaching the stage you all know: coughing up phlegm from my lungs. The past couple times I was sick this caused inflammation, which lead to an increased use of my emergency inhaler, which got me a prescription to prednisone, which I HATE.

 It's a fairly predictable series of steps, and I'm wondering if anyone has any strategies to prevent it. Already on preventitive medications (wixela, singulair) and dupixent. I'm fairly well controlled except when I get sick, then my lungs get effed up."

"Trying to figure out if my daughter has mild asthma or not. Allergist doesn't think so much I do.

She has only had one real attack when it was cold and windy outside. Wondering if it was fluke. She coughs sometimes right before she falls asleep but doesn't cough throughout the  ight or during the day. She never wheeze, never short of breath."
"For the past week I¬¥¬¥¬¥ ve had a lot of trouble breathing and like the title says, both my Ventolin and Symbicort dont work. It¬¥s more annoying than anything, not worried yet. I¬¥ve tried mucus relievers and drinking hot water, but this sensation always returns.

Any suggestions?"
havent been taking my flovant as much recently ( i know im terrible ) and when i dont take it as much i get real bad chest congestion . i took it this morning and i know the inhaler only starts working long term but man im glad coffee also helps lol

"I have adult-onset asthma that began less than 2 years ago. One thing that I struggle with is understanding the difference between an asthma attack versus your asthma just being bad. I would greatly appreciate your help in helping me learn! 

Here are some examples:

1) Before I was diagnosed, I had an episode that lasted for hours after climbing several flights of stairs. I had acute trouble breathing, it felt like I could not get enough air for each breath. My lungs subjectibely felt very small. 

2) (After I was diagnosed with asthma) When I was sick with bronchitis, my asthma got pretty bad. One of those nights I couldn't sleep because it felt like I was breathing through a very thin straw, and every 1-3 minutes would have a strong cough attack. I stayed up the entire night due to coughing and not being to breathe. (This did not improve with albuterol)

3) my asthma is currently not controlled, so about 2 days per week I have ""bad asthma days"" - which can mean I have an episode that lasts for several hours where I'm feeling like I am out of breath no matter how much I breathe, and my lungs feel small. I might cough more. I am deeply uncomfortable due to feeling like I can't get enough air. My Albuterol inhaler usually doesn't help, but if I'm by my Nebulizer that usually helps 50-100%. If I am not home, then I will go grab a very strong espresso, which works better than albuterol for me. 

4) Sometimes at night when I'm trying to fall asleep, I can't fall asleep due to not being able to breathe in enough air. If I doze off for 1-5 minutes I can get woken up from not getting enough air. This usually does respond to albuterol or the Nebulizer thankfully. 


Which of these is an asthma attack, if any?"

"My doctor is referring me to a pulmonologist due to a recent increase in the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms, but the doctor I've been referred to is a pediatric pulmonologist? I'm 24, turning 25 this year, so I'm a little confused as to why. Any insight into this?"
"26M As I'm writing now, I'm having some exacerbations due to a viral infection (don't know if it's a flu / covid may be be cold). 
I forgot about asthma in the last months (1 year since first diagnosed), I want to ask you If the preventive inhaler Fostair can be used when dialing with a viral infection(Cold, Flu, Covid..), as writing in the notice :
- Take Fostair with precaution if you are dialing with a viral infection... .
This my first time trying this inhaler, I can't revisit my doctor right now."
"My whole life I have struggled with sinus and allergy issues. Lots of antibiotics growing up. Had bad issues in the spring and fall. I ended up in the ER twice when I got the flu, which was probably made worse by my allergy and sinus issues. Finally went to an allergist a few years ago and was allergic to everything moderately, mostly it was trees, grass and mold. Before I started allergy shots, I was getting hacky, sometimes dry coughs keeping me up at night. Got tested for asthma and didn‚Äôt have any alarming data that said I have asthma but i was always out of breath and had a cough. Spirometry and other tests were borderline meaning it was normal but slight lower than normal. Typically‚Ä¶ First my allergy would flare up then I‚Äôm stuck being sick for about a week while my lungs recovered. I started on allergy medicine and steroid inhalers at this time and allergy shots. Sometimes used rescue inhaler. I was feeling FANTASTIC. So good that I stopped everything when I got to the maintenance allergy shot dose. I had zero issues for about a year and half. so now it‚Äôs spring and that allergy crap / dry cough keeping me awake at night came back and I am back on allergy medicine and a new inhaler - AirDuo. I feel a lot better. I am just confused‚Ä¶ is this bad allergies or truly allergic asthma? It doesn‚Äôt seem that the data supports it but my body feels like it."

This seems different from normal wheezing. It comes and goes randomly and only happens during inhalation. Doctors haven't been much help so far. Anyone else experience this?

curious if you could answer that ?
"Can anyone here help me out? I think I may have a mild case of asthma, but I'm not sure.. I don't much about this stuff.

I think it's worth mentioning that I've had eczema on and off since I was about 7 and I used to get upper respiratory infections a lot, but it wasn't until recently I've had trouble breathing at some points. My chest gets tight, it feels like someone put something heavy on it, and it kind of hurts to breathe in deeply. This has happened more than once in the past year, and each time I thought it was just a panic attack. 

This happened when I was at work yesterday, and I thought I was just tired from walking around a lot, or that maybe I was having another panic attack, but I took some Bronkaid and felt better. 

Can you develop asthma later in life? Should I see a doctor about this?"
"Managed to dogde an infection until now, and the first thing that came to my mind was whether I should throw away my inhaler after recovery. I‚Äôve been taught to throw toothbrushes and stuff like that away after being sick ever since I was a kid, so I‚Äôm wondering if the same rule applies to inhalers or if using a medical-grade disinfectant on it would be enough? Was diagnosed with asthma in 2020 and my doctor never mentioned anything about inhaler hygiene besides flushing my mouth after use to prevent oral thrush. 

My insurance covers a new inhaler only every 3 months and this one I‚Äôve had for about 1.5 months so there‚Äôs also some hassle with getting a new one prematurely. If any of you have had advice from your doctor about a similar situation, I‚Äôd appreciate hearing what you were told!"
How many people here with asthma only see their PCP rather than a respiratory specialist? I feel like now's the time for me to see a specialist. I feel like I've gotten worse over the years and my PCP doesn't see it or careü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"Anybody know why this new xanthine hasn't seen much use? No increased heart rate like theophylline the older version and no action on adenosine receptions. No increased risk of severe asthma exacerbations like labas carry or serious adverse events in larger studies. No suicide or mental health risks like singulair. I just wonder why the enthusiasm is low when the other options all carry a black box label or formerly do, and we are aware of the seriousness of ICS and other steroid side-effects. Not to mention this is the only anti-inflammatory+bronchodilator on the market that's not two separate drugs. At the very least this may have a steroid sparing effect."
"Hi guys. I have always had pretty bad pollen allergies, which also trigger some food oral allergy syndrome. My allergy is getting worse within the past couple years. Last year I had to double the amount of Zyrtec and nasal spray but still have symptoms. Lately when I have regular allergy symptoms (sneezing, running nose, itchy eyes, hives etc) I have been experiencing chest tightness and shortness of breath. It‚Äôs not like I am gasping for air. I can still breath fine but it‚Äôs just really tiring. I feel my chest is heavy, breathing is tiring and takes an effort, and I would need to sit down for a while. I have some intermittent dry cough, but not much. No wheezing. The symptoms are not sever, but it‚Äôs annoying. Throughout the day I just often feel heaviness in chest. Is it possible that this is allergic asthma? I feel like asthma might gave me more serious symptoms? But also I have never had these things before. So I am really confused. I have an allergist appoint in about a month, so just want to get some insight here. Thanks!"
"Hello,

We are, Respira labs, an organization working on a new medical device. We are making great progress with our wearable sensor that can monitor lung function in real-time.

Anyone want to share experiences with Xolair? How long did it take to start helping you? Any advice?
"I have eosinophilic asthma, and I lived in SE Germany for a few years. While I was there I noticed I didn't need my inhaler at all, and I wasn't on Singulair. As soon as I moved back to the US (I live in the south) I got sick almost immediately and I had been doubled-over trying to catch a full breath. I'm back on Singulair and use my inhaler at least once a week now. 

I'm just wondering if there's any difference in pollen or allergens in the air between the US and Europe?"
"I am setting up an appointment with my GP later this morning, but I wanted to see if this had happened to anyone else.

I have very well controlled asthma, but I am also allergic to all of the common plants and molds in my area. Spring has just started and it's raining. 

Yesterday morning I started to feel weird, but it didn't get bad until after I ate lunch, 11:30. I was dizzy and lightheaded. At 11:45 I had to take the kids I work with to the nurse's office, so I did a quick pulse ox on myself and it read 86, so I figured that was wrong and took the kids back. At 12:10 I had to take another kid up and I felt worse, so I checked again and I was at 92 with 124 heart rate. I had the nurse double check it for me. She said my lungs sounded a little off in one spot, so I went back to my classroom, used my inhaler, and called my doctor. They advised me to go to an urgent care right away, so I did.

I was seen at the urgent care at 1:00, and my pulse ox was reading 96. They determined that I was not dehydrated, so they did blood work to see if I was anemic. While waiting around, I got back up to 98-99. Blood work found nothing out of the ordinary. I went home and laid down and made sure to drink a lot of fluids. 

Could it have been my asthma? I didn't have any of the normal symptoms of an asthma attack, but the inhaler seemed to help. The people at the urgent care said the nurse's pulse ox probably malfunctioned and I was never actually that low."
"So I've had asthma since I was a child. But it's been silent since then until the first week of February. I never knew what triggered it. I've been having wheezing and cough all day and only thing that helps me is Ventolin (Salbutamol). It only works for a short time because as I'm told it's just for emergency response. 

My doctor gave me Seretide¬Æ25mcg/12500g which I take 2 puffs 12hrs apart. He said when my symptoms get better and its all gone, don't stop taking it and add +3 months when my symptoms disappear and then that's when I will stop taking it. My symptoms were already gone a few days after taking it.

My father also has asthma and he took this too around a decade ago. He said after he took it, his asthma was a lot better and rarely came back.

My question is how does it work and anyone here with the same experience as me? Thank you!"
Hi guys I‚Äôm a 21f and after a chat with my doctor we decided that because of my anxiety and rapid heart beat I‚Äôm going to stop taking my 10mg montelukast starting tonight. I‚Äôm not gunna lie I‚Äôm a little scare because I‚Äôve been taking it since high school (about 4-5 years) and now on a random Wednesday I just stopped taking it. Has anyone else just stopped it and noticed an improvement? If anything changes I‚Äôll definitely update the page but for now wish me luck! I hope this really helps with my anxiety and doesn‚Äôt effect my asthma too much
"Son (age22) has had asthma for 20 years. It has gotten steadily worse since he hit puberty. He‚Äôs been on different meds as well as allergy shots and nothing (since puberty) has really helped.

He‚Äôs now obese (can‚Äôt exercise because he can‚Äôt breath when he does) and uncontrolled (Singulair, Ventolin 8+ times per day, and Mucinex occasionally). 

I want him to start completely over and see a specialist. Where to begin? What kind of specialist? How to test for the ‚Äútype‚Äù of asthma? 

Any doctor recommendations in Central Ohio?   Thanks!

"I am currently weaning off or down dosing my inhaler

I am doing this because I've never really had a problem with asthma I think. I was only diagnosed with adult asthma because I had an awfully dry cough and minor chest pain. Which to be fair at the time I was 300 lbs and working as a welder in a chemical plant, so that might have contributed to my situation a little. But with that in mind I was also diagnosed with GERD and sleep apnea the same year. So we really are not sure if it was my gerd/sleep apnea causing problems or my asthma. 

Now Ik you may be asking ""weren't you tested for asthma?"" And to answer that yes I was tested. But it just a pocket spirometry device that my PCP carried around. It was plastic with a little gauge on the side nothing crazy. I was never formally tested until today.

I had my first appt with a pulmonologist and had a more formal spirometry test and some imaging done. He said he more that comfortable taking me down in does or off of my inhalers. He stated that my lungs have good volume, my scans are all clear and my airways sound clear as well. So idk if my inhalers work extra well or was I potentially miss diagnosed 3 years ago. 

Either way I am extremely nervous coming off of my inhalers and I am wondering if anyone has had success down doesing or weaning off completely?"
"Hey everybody, I had asthma as a kid that went away in my teen years and early twenties and it decided to make a return recently, so I have been put on an inhaler again.

I'm using a albuterol sulfate HFA inhaler, and I just needed to use it, helped a lot with my shortness of breath however it has made me pretty nauseous. 

I am wondering if this is a common thing and anyone else here has experienced it, also wondering if I should keep using the inhaler.

Thanks."
"I had my first asthma attack in Oct. 2019. I had to go to the ER and I've been on flovent and levalbuterol eversince. Last month I started an exercise routine (just short runs) 2-3 times a week. My doctor said to take levalbuterol beforehand and I do. It helps a lot but I""ve noticed I'm just not the same as I was before the attack.

Yes I can run short distances but it feels like I'm drowning when catching my breath. I have to take shorter breaths over a longer period of time than before the attack happened. The longer breaths don't feel like they help as much anymore either.

Is this just how life is now? Is there any way to get that lung volume (or w/e it is) again? It makes me so sad and anxious and the doctors don't take me seriously because I already have a maintenance inhaler. As if that solves all your problems. Bleh.

Thanks guys"

"I know what he‚Äôs talking about, that alcohol-y taste. He uses ProAir, because it‚Äôs our doctors preferred inhaler to prescribe.

He was ok with it for months, then today he was coughing so we used the inhaler and he immediately pulled away gagging. Tried again a few minutes later, same results. From what i gather, the albuterol is suspended in a solution containing alcohol, and this is pretty common for rescue inhalers?

With that in mind, has anyone got any tips or advice on how to mask the taste without affecting the medicine? I was thinking about a drop of vanilla on a piece of gauze and kind of wipe it around the mouthpiece of the spacer? Or something similar."

"Tw: mentions of mucus and puking

To start off I‚Äôve been pretty lucky. I‚Äôve had asthma since I was little and it got better as I got older. I got a pause in the severity from I was about 13-17. Then it started getting worse again. I‚Äôd have attacks and I have a handful of allergies that put me on my ass thanks to the asthma. It came up that I had sleep apnea in which they decided to remove my tonsils. But here again, it‚Äôs been getting a step worse. I‚Äôve had to go back to a daily inhaler, Benadryl for small allergy attacks, carrying my rescue at all times, and very painful chest pressure. The best I can describe it is bruised? I never know when a coughing fit will start so I carry a drink and my inhaler with me, I‚Äôve been having coughing attacks that end with me coughing up mucus and puking it out. I know that I‚Äôm lucky to not have had to deal with this side of asthma when I was younger but now that I am I have no clue what to do. 
Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you so much!!!"
"I have intermittent asthma and I wonder what does my SpO2 means? I was barely treated for asthma since high school and I am now in college. I checked that mine SpO2 fluctuates from 95 to 100.

"Hi all. I've been having asthma exacerbations since april of last year (I have allergic asthma) where I had major shortness of breath until december when I did a 5 day course of prednisone in which my breathing got dramatically better. For the past few weeks however, I've been having chest pain and tightness in which the pain would be in one part of my chest like my upper chest, then would move hours later to my lower chest, then move hours later to the sides of my chest, then my middle chest etc, which would make me feel winded but luckily not making me as short of breath like last year.

I will be seeing my allergist next month to discuss this but I wanted to ask if anyone had similar experiences with chest pain like that. Whenever I have chest pain, I would usually feel it all over my chest and not feeling it move around my chest."

If you're one of the people who aren't affected this way, that's awesome. At least half of people seem not to experience this. Just watch your vitals is all I'm saying!   


Essentially, if you are asthmatic and use Tylenol you should check your blood oxygen. The longer you're on it, the more you deplete your lung tissue protecting mucus of a critical master antioxidant. In response to the lack of that protection, fluid fills your lungs and irritation occurs.   


For decades, I've had chest colds / bronchitis whenever I got body pains and took it that body pains was a precursor towards respiratory illness. I went in for a minor outpatient surgery and started taking Tylenol the next day. Aware of the fact that any virus or bacteria would take longer then that to gestate, I got suspicious.   


My spO2 was 88% after a full day on Tylenol. I felt like I was drowning. My normal with my 2 control meds is 97%. Since I've been recovering for a couple of weeks, I had more opportunity to play with Tylenol. Without fail, the days I take it, my blood oxygen tanks and I feel strain. When I use buffered aspirin, and ibuprofen, I do not experience this problem. I've since thrown out all my Tylenol. 

Some googling after that point lead me down a rabbit hole to numerous studies from 2005 and 2008 about Tylenol's negative effect on the lungs and especially among asthmatics."


My dose increased from 200 micrograms in the morning and at night to 400 micrograms in the morning and at night-so 800 micrograms for the whole day overall now- and I have been having a headache all day and I don't know if that's a side effect or unrelated?
"About a month ago, I woke up and felt a bit fluish and Ill, my windpipe was tighter than normal, swallowing was a bit more difficult and I definitely was having some trouble breathing. Also a lot of phlegm made breathing harder. Nothing serious, but annoying and I felt less energy. 

It has persisted since then, and over the last week has started to get a lot worse. Anytime I exert myself my symptoms get a bit worse, and don‚Äôt get better after time. It isn‚Äôt like an attack, but each time this happens my upper chest gets a little tighter and feels more inflamed. And getting good breaths a bit harder. At no point has it gotten any better on its own.

When it happens I feel fine otherwise, not at all like an emergency.

It‚Äôs been really fucking with me and I have 0 energy right now. My sleep is also horrible. 

Does this sound like asthma? I thought it might be an infection at first but I‚Äôm not sure now. I don‚Äôt get any wheezing or coughing.

Whenever I go outside to breathe fresh air I feel 10x better. Or leaning forward helps.

I‚Äôm thinking of getting an air purifier, the doc I saw said I should have a chest X-ray and some other things done, but if I need help to go to the ER, since specialist wait times are weeks-months where I am."
"Since I had Covid (over a month ago), I feel something sticking out of my rib cage when I inhale deeply (right under the chest)It kind of pops out for a second, I‚Äôm not sure what it is. I had breathing issues after Covid, but no pneumonia or anything. Have you experienced something similar? What helped you?"
More than a year ago my asthma got significantly worse even medicine didn't help much and still doesn't. I am 17 and woder if that could be the case.
"I‚Äôd like to know your personal experience on ageing with asthma, or ppl you know that are affected by it.

"I was a hardcore trail runner and weight trainer for 25 years. Then I got lung poisoning (Fibre glass dust) and contracted humidity and exercise induced asthma (Heart rate related). My trail running and weights had to stop, for 3 years now. I've been doing basic home aerobics and stretching. Even if I do a slow jog outdoors, my asthma can easily get triggered unless I'm so careful. Once triggered, I struggle to breathe for 4- 6 hours with inhalers. 

What do others do?"

"I was diagnosed when I was about 9 years old. I completed in running, cross country, long jump, triple  jump and all sort of sports until I was a teen and I simply couldn't carry on. I would almost pass out at the finish line and I had no idea how serious it was. I've had the blue inhaler all my life, but not the brown one (this is in the UK). Since doctors didn't take it seriously, neither did I or my parents. Eventually, I stopped for good and preform gentle exercises at home because even the gym is sometimes too much for me.

Today I ran for the first time in years. I took it very slow and thought I would run a few meters and then stop for a break. Well, I ran and stopped, but I quickly realised that my breathlessness wasn't going away. I tried not to panic and breathe slowly, but after a few minutes it wasn't easing. 

I was literally just dialling for the emergency services when I felt like my lungs had opened up and I took a breath. I walked there and back instead and my lungs were burning and still hurt an hour later. 

Keeping in mind I'm perfectly fit until a couple of years ago due to mental health and otherwise I was active and exercised all my life. Now, I'm struggling to get back into it. Even though I took it lightly and didn't even run fast or far, I haven't had an episode this bad since I ran competitively.

I have no idea how I'm supposed to incorporate exercises into my daily life and prevent from this happening. I was never taught or told how to deal with this and I literally would just have attacks every time I ran or excercised too hard and everyone acted like it was normal. On some occasions the inhaler wouldn't even work and I've had to have medical intervention.  

Can anyone educate me how to run and be fit while not causing myself harm and distress? I have no idea where to start and doctors only prescribe the inhaler and tell me to ""take it easy"" like it helps. Thanks"
"I‚Äôve had poorly controlled asthma for as long as I could remember. I didn‚Äôt take my inhalers unless I caught a cold. I decided to take my asthma seriously and I am working closely with an allergist. 

Am I supposed to take my rescue inhaler whenever I feel phlegm in my throat? Or whenever wheezing occurs when I lay down? Are coughing fits asthma flare ups?

I‚Äôve had asthma my entire life but after reading threads on r/asthma I feel like I don‚Äôt know anything about anything lol."
"I passed this man in a store and he REEKED of cigarette smoke even though he wasn‚Äôt actively smoking. I felt a twinge in my chest but thought maybe it was all in my head; paranoia because I‚Äôve had bad chest pains from third hand smoke in the past. 

Anyone else react to second/third hand smoke? How much exposure does it take for you to have asthma symptoms?"

"So for the past few months I‚Äôve started coughing a lot like my throat gets so itchy I have to cough but once I start coughing I can‚Äôt stop. Lately it‚Äôs been getting worse where my throat and chest feel constricted I guess and it‚Äôs hard to take full breaths. I‚Äôm coughing up a lot of mucus and that helps me breathe for a few seconds and then I‚Äôm off to having trouble breathing again. Both my nostrils are stuffed and I have trouble breathing through them anyway. I can almost hear the air trapped in my lungs like through the air sacs if that makes sense. I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with asthma and I have two guinea pigs that I‚Äôm allergic to so I‚Äôm assuming this is some sort of allergen to them, but does this sound like asthma? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated."
Just looking for advice. We live in Canada and it's a bit chilly here. It was minus 7 today so I decided to take the kids for a walk. My daughter is fighting off a cold and had a bit of a cough yesterday into today but nothing awful. Half way through our walk she started coughing like crazy then turned to wheezing and lethargic.  I panicked and took her home and within minutes she was fine. Checked her breathing with a oximeter and it was 99%. So confused because we just got her allergy tested and she is allergic to cats and mold but the Dr didn't think asthma even a little bit. She plays outside everyday at daycare without any symptoms at all. Not sure what to think. I called and made a appointment with both her allergist.  I decided to take her to the Dr this afternoon because she started complaining about her cheek and ear. She has a ear infection and sinus infection.  So I got her amoxicillin.  Not sure if it's maybe connected or just a fluke situation since she literally no other symptomsany other time.  Just need advice or kind words. I feel really upset.
"will making a diy dehumidifier using a bucket of rock salt, irritate my lungs? my room gets very humid at night and i have sleep apnea, which makes it hard for me to go to sleep, as high humidity worsens my sleep apnea. the weather is getting warmer, and the humidity is getting worse."
"It feels like every time I‚Äôm in the mood to exercise there‚Äôs something that goes wrong. Am I supposed to sit at home and rot all day? 
I can barely breathe at night and I take my purple inhaler daily. Sleep deprivation is fucking me up and theres mould in my room. Wtf are asthmatics supposed to do"
I have an extreme mucus production issue. During my last workout which was cardio i coughed up 80 grams of mucus which is about 3 ounces. I weighed it on scale to make sure. I know this is disgusting but is there something seriously wrong with me?  I was able produce mucus with every cough for 40 minutes straight during my workout. I coughed onto 4 paper towels that were on the floor which collected the spit and mucus. I know this is gross but I need to know what‚Äôs wrong with me. To summarize I coughed up 80 grams of spit within 30 minutes.
"I was diagnosed with cough variant asthma as a kid. didn‚Äôt have many issues unless I got a cold, in which case I would cough and cough till I could barely breathe. never had any wheezing though. My asthma seemed to disappear entirely in my teens, only to return in my mid 20s.

Lately I‚Äôve been experience this weird symptom where I‚Äôll feel out of breath in a way I never used to. It just feels like my chest muscles have tightened and aren‚Äôt moving how they‚Äôre supposed to. If I sit down and really focus, I can breathe more comfortably. I don‚Äôt wheeze, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like my lungs are blocked or filled with mucus or anything. It‚Äôs just like my diaphragm forgot out to work or something.

I take my rescue inhaler when it happens and most of the time it doesn‚Äôt seem to do much. If there‚Äôs any mucus in my lungs, I‚Äôll cough it up after the inhaler, but lots of times there‚Äôs nothing.

Is this a common asthma experience?

(for context I‚Äôm on montelukast and levalbutrtol. I also have POTS and MCAS)"

"I‚Äôm having this symptom lately, but there isn‚Äôt any actual wheezing. Does anyone else ever have just the phlegm/mucus without tightness?"
"Im on the highest dose of flovent hfa, is it safe to use such a high dose long term?"
"Is it just me or anyone her who get emotionally drained and exhausted and feels like crying after a Asthma attack?

I get attacks mostly after evening, something just triggers it and I go completely insane. i can't stop overthinking, reply my past in head, i think about all the worst things happen while i feel like someone is standing on my chest and i want to cry but i can't even do that. Than i take my inhaler and just goto sleep and hope i don't die in sleep and this never repeat the next day."
"Hi all, another 'I'm worried my Asthma could completely fuck up a situation that would've otherwise been totally normal an inconsequential even tho I'm prob gonna be fine' post.

I caught covid recently, had what would prob be considered a mild case of it - very sore throat for 2 days, runny nose, noseblee and lost my sense of taste but no Asthma issues. Negative on Sunday.

I went to the er for chest pains on Monday, Xray all clear but since then I've been super anxious over them since they'd continued to persist + some moments where I'd feel like I not took in any air. I heard Pneumonia was more common (and more severe) in Asthmatics and could occur post covid too. 

Should I be worried is what I am asking."
"Hello, I‚Äôm in this subreddit to ask this question for people that were diagnosed with asthma.

I am having doubts of my condition because of few reasons:

1. I have not wheezed since childhood, especially since I was formerly an athlete.

2. It never interrupted my sleeping.

3. I don‚Äôt have persistent cough.

4. I have not feel any pain when I breathe.

5. The doctor from my clinic at college told me that my throat is not inflamed and I‚Äôm breathing perfectly fine.

6. No chest pains.

I don‚Äôt know if this is an asthma thing but when I run (this the first time I ran since the pandemic), I spat out a lot of phlegm and that made me breathe very good. Yes I have mucus but the doctor told me it‚Äôs mainly just allergies doing this to me.

I was diagnosed when I was a child, but have not took any treatment since 2016. Also, the inhalers my guardian have were expired because of the expenses of the medications. However last year, I have an attack because I was thinking that the birth control pills were killing me. My family told me that I was having a heart/asthma attack and I should get it checked. I got it checked and my doctor (primarily) told me it could be either an anxiety attack or asthma attack. Never less, they prescribed me the inhaler.

So, I‚Äôm lost here because I feel like I‚Äôm asymptomatic of my asthma and I have never told an inhaler because I was never prescribed one since 2016, but they said I have asthma since it‚Äôs on my record and they never bother to check me out.

Need help, please!"
"im writing here because i trust you guys more then i trust google and im too broke to afford a doctor. over the past 2 months my asthma has taken a turn for the worst, i wake up gasping for air regularly and find myself using my inhaler a shit load during the day. part of me thinks my bodys developed a dependency to the medication but the rest is just concerned. any thoughts as to what could be doing it? ive lived in the same place for years and im a skater so im not a fat guy or stuck some where gross. the only thing i can connect it to is when this all started i was remodeling a house with a bunch of cats and i had an asthma attack. but that was two months ago, ive had attacks before, i should have bounced back by now right; what the hell is kickin my ass? 
thanks for reading this if you did, id really appreciate the input."
"So I work outside and don‚Äôt wheeze all day but as soon as I come home I start to wheeze a little bit so I use my salbutamol inhaler but when I wake up I‚Äôm wheezing a little bit again, should I be getting a humidifier, dehumidifier, or what should I do to get rid of the wheezing that doesn‚Äôt require an inhaler, thanks"
"I‚Äôm dealing with a coughing/wheezing based attack right now, only a few weeks after I finished a 4 week long ‚Äòshortness of breath‚Äô attack. I finally got off my steroids and maintenance inhalers too, and I just don‚Äôt understand what my trigger was this time. Is this seriously my life? Having shitty asthma attacks, followed by a week of relief just to fall back in that cycle?

As I‚Äôm sitting in the middle of the night trying to deal with this, i‚Äôm wondering: is it okay to take albuterol sooner than the 4 hour time window if you‚Äôre experiencing symptoms? I took a dosage two hours ago but here I am wheezing and coughing again‚Ä¶"
"Hi everyone, I have a question that I can‚Äôt quite figure out the answer to. I was told that using albuterol more than a couple times per week can actually be really bad for you, but I also know that people with exercise induced asthma are told to use albuterol daily before working out. How does it make sense that some people are instructed to use it every day while others are  warned against it? I cannot figure out an answer"

"My boyfriend has asthma but he doesn‚Äôt take it very seriously, according to him he rarely notices it now, but I‚Äôm worried about him. His inhaler has been empty for over a month now and he hasn‚Äôt gotten another and tonight it seemed like he was struggling but when I kept asking if he was sure he was okay he just brushed me off. He‚Äôs asleep now but his breathing and snoring is not how it normally is (I‚Äôm just glad he is snoring so I can tell he‚Äôs still breathing). I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone can tell me how to look for signs that he might be struggling more than he‚Äôs let on, I‚Äôm not going to be able to sleep tonight I‚Äôm too paranoid about his breathing now."
"This started maybe a few weeks ago, but now there is a regular smell coming into my apartment, mostly in the bedroom. I honestly don't even know if it's weed or some kind of tobacco but it's very pungent and has caused my symptoms to get much worse now. I'm coughing and wheezing more than before.  The building superintendent is essentially useless and doesn't seem he will do anything about it. I put an air purifier into the bedroom and it's helped a little. Not sure what to do honestly, I don't even know who the smoker is. Could be the unit across from me, beside me, above or below. Moving isn't an option, and for all, I know I could have the same problem at a new place too. I debated calling the police but I doubt that would accomplish anything either. It's so frustrating, after years of severe asthma I was able to get it largely under control, and now this is making everything worse again."

"So I just heard that several countries are transitioning to corona as an endemic virus, instead of something that we want to go fully away. As a pretty severe asthmatic, albeit one who's worked out to reduce its effects, am I going to be stuck in isolation and masking for the rest of my entire life? The slim ray of hope I had throughout this entire pandemic was that people would wise up, take the virus seriously, and take necessary steps to reduce it, but living in the good ol' US of A, denial and death seems to be the future, with no foreseeable end in sight.

I have so, SO many hobbies and dreams I've wanted to pursue, but have been unable to do so during pandemic. Wrestling, rock climbing, working out at the gym, and all of them completely negated by the fact that if I catch it even ONCE, I'm practically a dead woman.

I could only hold out for so much longer before the sheer despair of my circumstances makes it impossible to go on, but with this, I legit feel like I have no reason to hope for anything better. Ever.  
It's been, like, how many waves at this point? And we STILL haven't taken the necessary steps? And I STILL have to just accept that my future will refuse to change?

I'm bereft of all hope right now. If anyone has any words of positivity, or even just ways to further protect myself right now, I really, really need them.

Sincerely - Someone who has done practically everything she could, and seen almost no change in her circumstances whatsoever."
"Could use some help.  I've been suffering from shortness of breath ""more often than not"" for the past 2 years.  I do have gerd and once every other week or so get that flow up my throat when I'm trying to sleep. I did do a pft and the pulmonogist told me she believes I have asthma - see pft results below. However I get little to no relief from inhalers.  I've had numerous x-rays and one ct with contrast that said everything looks normal.  I always thought asthma to be periodic episodes and not like low grade lasting for days.

No pain or tightness in my chest. Definitely tight in my throat and flush in the face. 

I've noticed some stridor and wheezing.  Both aren't very pronounced and come and go but they are there.  There are times when I dry cough quite a bit then weeks with nothing.  I do clear my throat more often during this time.  Sometimes I have a productive cough.  I do have a deviated septum and cant breath out the nose hardly.

Seasons have something to do with the severity.  In the spring it's way worse it seems, winter and deep summer not too bad.  I smoked for about 10 years give or take and vaped for about a year or so.  I have pretty bad anxiety from when I was in the military 15 years ago.  I am overweight and want to try and correct that.

"I've had asthma since I was 2. its been 14 years since then, my asthma has come easier but I cant see myself growing out of it. my older cousin grew out of it, but I don't remember him ever having asthma. did you do anything to help grow out of it? or was it just something that happened?"
"So I moved back into my house after it was treated for mold and asbestos about two months ago and I developed / am having asthma symptoms frequently. I would really appreciate some insight on this. It‚Äôs really interfering with my daily life and I‚Äôm not sure what this looks like for me long term. 

Some background information:

Growing up I would get a little asthma every once in a blue moon - usually after being outside or just randomly in the evening. It didn‚Äôt happen very often and I never saw a doctor or allergist about it or anything. 

In my 20s I have worked around a lot of substances. I studied painting and sculpture in college, painted apartments, and worked as a carpenter for two years. 

Okay, my situation: 

I moved in with my girlfriend this past August and everything was fine for a few months. I‚Äôm an artist and I set up a studio space in our basement. 

I started noticing myself feeling sick (just sick/nauseous no respiratory issues) after spending a lot of time down there working on projects, so I reached out to our landlord and asked them to check it out. They checked several things and ultimately detected mold and asbestos in the basement. 

They brought in a mold remediation company to take care of both the mold and asbestos. Me and my girlfriend were feeling good about the situation being taken care of until they started working on it the first day.

They started by setting up ‚Äúcontainment‚Äù - sectioning off the basement from the rest of the house with plastic sheeting. But they didn‚Äôt do it properly at first. They literally just put little pieces of plastic sheeting on top of some but not all of the air ducts and installed a zipper door over the door to the basement. 

They didn‚Äôt finish setting it up or securing it and didn‚Äôt shut the zipper door before starting the remediation process and the entire house flooded with dust. Me and my partner started feeling weird and we could feel it in our lungs so we left and ended up working it out with the property management co. to credit us for time away from the house while the work was completed. Because we lost all confidence in this company based on that first day, we requested that the air be tested by a third party afterwards to give us some peace of mind and they agreed. 

We moved back in and I had a strange series of health events (some of which may not be related). Our first week back, I immediately had what I thought to be food poisoning - sick, nauseous, room spinning, etc. It went away after a couple days and then I had an anaphylactic reaction to something - I‚Äôm still not sure what. I‚Äôve never had anything like that happen before. And ever since that happened, I have been dealing with breathing problems. 

It started as shortness of breath here and there and some sinus issues and progressed to a laundry list of issues that come and go: Dry sinus congestion, a kind of ‚Äúitch‚Äù feeling in the back of my throat, difficulty swallowing, a lump in my throat feeling, dry mucus feeling from my throat down into my chest, breathing difficulty, and just general malaise. 

The air in my house feels dry and kind of chalky, especially when the furnace is going. They ended up replacing a lot of the air ducts down in the basement with old, rusty looking ones for some reason. 

Me and my partner were able to get away for a few days recently and initially we felt so much better. My breathing felt almost normal after a few days, although a lot of my other symptoms persisted. We went back, and it got worse. But then we stayed away a few more days and it has been coming and going, so I‚Äôm really at a loss here figuring this out. 

I‚Äôve been working with a primary care doctor and an allergist, who suspect I have asthma. I haven‚Äôt received very good answers from them about what is going on yet. What I do know is I am a bit allergic to a lot of environmental things indoor and outdoor - I took an allergy test. I was prescribed several things from the allergist and am waiting to follow up with them and my regular doctor. I also have a pulmonary test coming up. 

Me and my partner are trying to get out of our lease and moved ASAP.

 I know what asthma typically feels like for me experiencing it growing up here and there and now I absolutely experience it when I work with wood and what I have been feeling is different. It‚Äôs hard to explain, it‚Äôs just not as wheezy, it‚Äôs never affected my throat or sinuses like this before, and my chest feels very different. 

It could be mold, or dust, or a coincidence, but I‚Äôm just trying my best to figure this out. If anyone can speak to a similar experience or onset of adult asthma, I would love to hear your story and any advice. I am working with doctors as much as I can. Does anyone here experience their asthma come on differently from different triggers?"
"So supposedly the worst type of wheezing is when you wheeze during inhale and exhale and that‚Äôs what happens to me when I do wheeze but I only wheeze when I get an allergic reaction to dust or a similar irritant gets in my airways, would it be better for me to use my rescue inhaler to get rid of the wheezing or just wait it out because it always goes away with time (usually overnight) my wheezing doesn‚Äôt make it harder to breathe it‚Äôs just a super annoying noise that frustrates me so much, I hate this, any tips other than staying away from dust and irritants?"
"Just started tudorza today, going to use it tonight. although I have a question about the counter number. i heard that it goes down by 10, instead of 1 and there are 60 doses available. i have to use it one inhalation twice a day. Does that mean that I have to refill it after using it 6 times? if so that‚Äôs kinda crazy üò≠"
"Hey y'all. Hope you're all doing good.

TLDR: working on controlling asthma... i seem to be getting better peak flow readings when i am tight chested or at least they don't get worse? Anyone experience this? Or maybe its just my improvement showing? Confuzeeed...

Long story:
I've been asthmatic for about 10 years now and have never controlled it well at all. Never took my preventative inhaler regularly and also smoking weed and tobacco daily pretty much every day since before i was diagnosed with asthma. 
I've had my ups and downs though and quit smoking a few times which never stuck though.
Recently i started having more problems after a cold or flu which left me coughing more than i usually do (i have a heavy asthma cough all year round), tight chest, etc so i have given all my willpower into trying to get my asthma under control.
I am tracking my peak flow daily, taking my preventative inhaler as prescribed and am smoking less and less each day. Didn't even have a cig in 3 days anymore and its been great. 
Of course i don't expect to have it under control in a week so I'm still getting tight chests quite a lot. But I've found, when i do a peak flow with a tight chest, that i seem to have a higher reading. 
Today i blew 590 which is my all-time high ever even though my chest was tight AF. 
What is everyones experiences with peak flow while having tight chest?
I don't tend to get very short of breath often, when i do i think its more because I'm panicking than anything. 
Anyone with similar experiences?"

"We've tried it all. Crushed in juice, milk, pudding, ice cream, etc. Liquid form. Liquid form mixed with the above. Nothing helps the terrible taste and it is a horrible struggle getting him to take it. The last time he needed it, we had to force it down his throat and it was traumatizing. 

I am at my wits end. We finally have an appointment with an asthma/allergy specialist. He is always sick, and when he is sick it hits him hard in the lungs. He has missed so much school because his symptoms linger on for so long. We've been using his nebulizer more and more. I don't even think the humidifier does anything. I feel like I am out of options and I'm so tired."
"Geez, I don‚Äôt know how many timesI hacen been taken seriously when presenting with flare-up symptoms and it never fails to piss me off. I have several stories that stick out in my mind‚Ä¶

1. When I was in high school, I started getting my yearly fall/winter flare up and decided to go to an urgent care since it would have taken weeks to see my primary care. When the doctor, an older gentleman, came in, I let him know I‚Äôd been using my nebulizer and rescue inhaler. He LITERALLY asked me ‚ÄúOkay, so what do you want me to do about it?‚Äù I looked him in the eye and said ‚ÄúPrescribe me a prednisone pack so I can nip this in the bud.‚Äù Needless to say, I was SHOCKED that I needed to tell a grown man who spent years in mes school what to do.

2. My senior year in college, I came down with a BAD case of asthmatic bronchitis during the winter. I couldn‚Äôt get more than 3 words out without going into a coughing fit. I went to the local Urgent Care, and they gave me ANTIBIOTICS. Needless to say, that did fuck-all nothing. So I went back, because I was still having so much trouble, and asked for a breathing treatment. They told me I didn‚Äôt need it. I was only taken seriously when I had my friend take me to the ER where I FINALLY got the breathing treatment, a prednisone prescription, a steroid shot, and an X-Ray that confirmed it wasn‚Äôt pneumonia.

3. I had a spring flare up in 2021, and went to a different Urgent Care. Upon entry and telling them I was having an asthma flare up, they took my pulse-ox and told me it was anxiety. I had to insist it was asthma before they actually saw me. (I do have anxiety, but I know what a flare up is if I‚Äôm panting just walking the short distance to the front door from my car in the parking lot.)

4. After I got my second round of the Pfizer COVID vaccine later that year, I got another flare up to the point my chest hurt. My roommate took me to the ER, and when I was finally seen the doctor told me it was GERD. I do have acid reflux, but the pain I get from that when it‚Äôs not maintained is usually in my throat, not my chest. He gave me a breathing treatment anyway and prescribed a antacid.

I genuinely do not know if anyone else with asthma has experienced something like this, but it‚Äôs really pissing me off. Advice on how to deal with this in the future would be appreciated. If you have your own horror stories, please also let me know."

"Eosinophilic asthma - a kind of asthma that most often makes in adults - is separate by an extended number of white bloods called eosinophils in the blood, lungs, and respiratory tract. Raised levels of eosinophils can cause bothering and expanding in the flight courses and respiratory system.

That is where eosinophilic asthma comes in. Its experts call it a subtype of asthma. Researchers are at this point working out how to describe these subtypes, and it is critical work since it could provoke interesting, additional convincing medications.

Until very recently, eosinophilic asthma inferred more normal asthma attacks and a lower quality of life. But an understanding of subtypes has led to new medicines that are quickly changing that picture."
"This year has been really bad, could my asthma have come back and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been causing what I thought was anxiety?"
"i got told i have allergic asthma - after  they heard wheezing and my chest and throat tightens  . i'm currently waiting for a primary doc appt - i have allergist too not sure how to tell about this 

i noticed my allergy meds aren't working and  multiple times i have had shortness of breath hour after a straining to go the bathroom"
"Tl;dr: I have severe asthma and it's extremely difficult everyday. I  have been missing class and doing horrible in school.  Medications do not seem to be helping and I'm on my last leg. Is there anything I can do to try and make it through this. 

For 2 years I (21f) have been dealing with asthma. I suspect I've always had it but it's never gotten to the point where I needed inhalers until about 2 years ago. Only in January did I go through asthma testing at a pulmonologist because doctors kept telling me that I was just experiencing panic attacks (I also have anxiety) and no one has actually told me I had asthma until January. After the test they concluded that I have it pretty bad. Highest lung inflammation numbers they've ever seen. Anyways, I have only been trying maintenance inhalers since then and for a whole month I took Symbicort but only once a day (it did not help) because that's what the box said, I go back to the pulmonologist and he tells me I should have been taking it twice a day and he also put me on singular and prednisone. The prednisone actually did improve things but not nearly enough to where I could operate like a normal human being. Now that I am off the prednisone I feel especially horrible. I've been taking the Symbicort twice a day for like a week and a half and I am seeing no improvements (the only thing it seems to do is lessen wheezing attacks but I now deal with constant chest tightest and heaviness that only lets up for like an half an hour hear and there during the day).

The real problem here is that I only have 2 months left until I am supposed to graduate and get my degree. And my history of straight A's is completely screwed up, now I am actually failing a class and I missed a test that I could not make up due to an attack. Going to school is literal hell. I sit there and seriously worry if I am going to die right then and there. Almost every time I go to class I have to leave and take albuterol. But my asthma is so bad that it doesn't do anything to help. I just take it so I can find some comfort that I won't die. Also, wherever I go I have a pulse oximeter to check my blood oxygen bc I think if that gets too low then I'm in trouble, but so far the readings have been anywhere between 96-99. I think it dipped one time to 90 but I took it again and it went back up, idk. 

It is very scary being alone and at school when I can barely breathe all day. I've been having to get rides to school from someone lately because attacks have happened when I drive and I need to pull over. My pulmonologist never said that I was gonna keel over from this but like it feels I am on the verge of dying from this shit. I'm not even being dramatic I am in pure distress right now and have no idea how I am going to make it for the next days, weeks and months and how I am going to graduate with this medical crisis going on. 

Thank goodness I am on my parent's insurance and can even go to a doctor and afford this really expensive medication. But honestly nothing helps and I am on my last leg here. If anyone here has had it so bad that they can barely get through the day and go to school or work, how did you make it through or at least manage enough to handle daily responsibilities."




I've only been prescribed albuterol but my new doctor said I need a controller inhaler and prescribed Qvar. Wondering if it's good long term.
"I‚Äôm tryna save money and DPI is cheaper from where I get it from, but do you think it will be safe if I‚Äôm mildly allergic to milk proteins? They say that the likelihood of milk protein contamination is low and there‚Äôs very small amounts in it even if it is, but I‚Äôm scared like, is it dangerous to inhale milk protein, even in small amounts, if I‚Äôm allergic to it? Will chronically inhaling it cause lung damage? I‚Äôm able to tolerate eating cheese, sour cream, and yogurt and very small quantities of raw milk. My antibody score for milk was 0.79 ku/L."
"I was diagnosed like four months ago. I‚Äôm 24 male. I‚Äôve always gotten bronchitis twice a year for as long as I can remember. Last year it got really really bad and persisted through antibiotics and about a month and a half of my body fighting it. Got some inhalers and boom! I could breathe. Mostly. I still have like three attacks a week. 

I also suffer from insomnia, ptsd, depression, mood swings. Which makes me a PERFECT candidate for Seroquel. 

Last night was my first time taking it and I passed out. Hard. Too hard. I woke up to my S.O. slapping the ever living shit out of me with my inhaler in her other hand. I couldn‚Äôt breathe and I couldn‚Äôt notice. 

If she didn‚Äôt wake me up or didnt notice that my snores aren‚Äôt typically wheezes or wasn‚Äôt awake, I fully believe I would have died in my sleep. 

Not taking it again. Waiting to hear back from the dr that prescribed that. Yeesh."
"Hi. I have allergic asthma. I am thinking about getting on xolair and get the prefilled version and wanted to ask about the copay. Is anyone automatically eligible if they have moderate asthma? And if eligible, would the copay be $5 or are there different levels of copays i.e. $20, $50?"
"I have had Asthma since I was a child it was severe with multiple hospital trips for attacks until I was around 13 then it went away until I was around 18 and stayed until around 4 years ago (I‚Äôm 34 now) 

I haven‚Äôt used an inhaler at all in the last 4 years but I have had chronic sinus infections, Sudafed and steam are the only things that help nose sprays allergy pills and antibiotics have really had no effect.

About a week ago I started to get the tell tale wheezing and chest tightness, I keep albuterol on hand just in case and when I used it the wheezing and chest tightness did ease.

The only real change is that we did get a cat back in October but apart from mild allergy symptoms when we first got her she hasn‚Äôt seemed to cause me any issues, I‚Äôm also not wanting to consider rehoming her as she part of the family now. 

I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow but I have never really been prescribed asthma meds in the US I‚Äôm from the UK and always had a preventative inhaler and a rescue inhaler and that‚Äôs it.

I have been looking into singulair and have noticed that some people get good relief from sinus issues with that too. Does anyone have any experience with this? 

Any advice in general about what to ask for at the doctors would be great i am completely lost with what seems to be new medications i have no experience with. It may just be that being a little bit sick with sinus issues again has set this off (I also tested for Covid just in case but it‚Äôs negative and when I had covid before it didn‚Äôt trigger my asthma at all) 

Any advice in general is also welcome, sorry for the long post!"

"Short explanation: I have had asthma my whole life up until my first year of college (~3 years ago) it wasn‚Äôt under control at all and I did not take preventatives. 

I have noticed that after I had Covid back in August 2020 my anxiety and asthma have both been more pronounced. I use Symbicort for my preventative (I have been on it for well over a year) I can definitely tell it helps a lot and when/if I get low or forget to take it as per my schedule I can feel a difference in my breathing. I also take Claritin for allergy mitigation, and Flonase for the same.  

Environment: I have a long haired shedding dog and a shedding cat that I love. I have a heavy allergy towards dust, pollen, mold however the only factor as of now that I think may slap me in the face would be dust. Me and my partner deep clean every Sunday. We have an air purifier in our bedroom and usually try and keep air circulation high in all rooms of the house. 

What are some tips to mitigate some of my symptoms(they are not pronounced every day and at this time I only feel short of breath after extensive physical activity but that may be attributed to the need for me to exercise more."
"Do any of you get discomfort that seems to localize itself only in the windpipe / larynx / trachea? It's hard to describe. Best way I can explain it is you know that general discomfort and crappy feeling you get when something goes ""down the wrong pipe?"" It kind of feels like that, but all the time. Not really pain, just like an exasperated, irritated feeling that also make you feel short of breath. Even the sensation of air from breathing passing over the area seems uncomfortable and irritating. Honestly I feel like I can get a full breath, BUT, the quality of that breath doesn't feel great.  Does that make sense?"
"*Before starting this post, I want to say that I already have an appointement scheduled with my doctor, I just want to have your opinions 

Chronological order of the past months:
- All my life until September 2021:
Small allergic asthma, ventolin when in contact with a cat
-September 2021:
Moving in my first apartment, starting to have daily asthma attacks 
-October 2021:
Discovering that I am allergic to dust-mites, buying protection for my bed
-October 2021 to February 2022:
Everything is alright, back to occasional asthma flare-ups
-March 2022:
Asthma suddenly gets very intense, forced to take ventolin often to sleep well

I would like to know if anyone as an idea of why the heck my symptoms changed this fast
(I wash my bedding regularly and recently vacuumed my mattress)"
"Help me y‚Äôall! Over the past few months my asthma and allergies have been severe and I‚Äôve developed a strong reaction to any kind of smells, and I can smell things from a mile away! I used to love perfume and now I can‚Äôt imagine wearing even the tiniest amount‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not just fragrance the weird thing is even food for example overly toasted bread‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶I wish my lungs would return to normal"
"I have to move out of our current house because the lease is up. Carpeting seems to be one of my biggest triggers, and there just aren‚Äôt a lot of houses or apartments on the market, let alone without carpet. 

But there is a single wide trailer that looks very nice, clean, and doesn‚Äôt have carpet. It is no where near my first choice, but we are running out of options. 

Is there any asthma related downside? One thing I thought of would be that it would be close to neighbors who might smoke or have fires, both of which would trigger my asthma. 

Is there anything I am overlooking? I do not have any experience living in a trailer or trailer park before."
"Everytime I go outside and start walking in fresh air I get triggerd into a coughing fit. I have had this going on for about a couple months. Used to use albuterol and qvar for a bit to handle the asthma but it would Give some side affects like head aches chest palpation and restlessness. 

I gave in and found my old albuterol inhaler and it works and controls the attack but it I did feel a bit of anxiety from it afterwords. I'm trying  figure out if there's anything better or alternative then using albuterol?"
"Wondering if anyone has any similar experiences? When I got pregnant I coughed aggressively every night for the first trimester. As soon as the second trimester hit it went away completely. Then during the third trimester it came back again and on top of that I would sometimes have trouble breathing when going for walks, especially at night when it was colder. Then after I gave birth, it got worse and on top of the coughing at night, I would also cough throughout the day and I also started wheezing at night when I was trying to sleep. I would also have trouble breathing more aggressively and throughout the day - walking up the stairs with my newborn baby would leave me winded like I ran a marathon. I‚Äôve done countless medical tests (X-rays, blood tests, ct scans, bone marrow biopsy, bronchoscopy) and the only thing the doctors see is the high eosinophil count in the blood tests. It‚Äôs been almost 2 years of this and it‚Äôs so frustrating not knowing what‚Äôs wrong with me and constantly feeling like I‚Äôm drowning and out of breath even on prednisone medication and symbicort inhaler. I‚Äôve also checked my house for mold and radon and the house seems to be fine. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem and was able to find the cause and any solutions. My respiratory specialist told me we‚Äôll probably never find the cause so I‚Äôm hoping someone here has any info. Thank you!"

"Hi, I have been breathless for the most part of 4 years with occasional cessation of symptoms. I had spirometry done that in the doctors words showed a ""mild obstruction"" and said if anything my breathing got worse after the ventolin.. wtf? I was then placed on a Fluticasone inhaler (orange one) and even still that doesn't help. I have had holter monitor/ecg before and no abnormalities were noted. I have had chest x-ray and same thing and I also had an endoscopy done in 2019 that showed numerous fundic polyps but no ""active gastritis"" when the biopsy was done it was noted there was chronic inflammation. I am really at a loss at what to do and I don't think I am being taken seriously by doctors. I feel like I am starving for air. I am a 28yr old male and yes I am slightly overweight but this problem started in 2018 when I was not overweight and was pretty active and since I haven't been able to breathe that well I have drastically cut back on exercise and have put on weight."
"i sometimes have this weird feeling in my lungs like they can't expand like they should and when it happens and i try to take a deep breath (or exhale) it makes a wheezing sound and i just can't get enough air. this usually happens after i suddenly take a bigger breath or hold my breath in for a little while. or after sneezing. rarely after yawning. like one moment my breathing is fine, then i take a big breath and my lungs kind of tighten. on worse days i even wake up in the middle of the night to use my inhaler because my lungs feel too tight (i got prescribed an inhaler about 8 years ago when i had bronchitis, went to a pulmonologist for weeks after that but my symptoms weren't that severe then so i didn't get diagnosed with asthma and they said i don't need to go anymore).

but the reason i'm questioning if i have asthma is bc after exercising my lungs are fine. i mean i get short of breath after running or climbing uphill but it's not that tightening sensation it's just the normal ""i need to catch my breath"" feeling which i think is normal. and for example i can go ice skating for 2 hours straight without any breathing problems. 

and one more thing: after i laugh very hard i always start coughing / wheezing and it doesn't stop for 5-10 minutes"

"So I always had some excess mucus with my asthma but the past few years, it‚Äôs been exceptionally bad. I notice its worse when I eat sugar and dairy but even though I cut back significantly, it‚Äôs still a major issue. When it first started getting really bad, I would get tonsil stones because I would swallow it most of the time. 

I know it‚Äôs a common issue but I feel like mine has gotten so severe. It‚Äôs hard for me to go more than 30 minutes without spitting out a ball of mucus. And if I‚Äôm working or doing something where I can‚Äôt spit, I‚Äôll have to swallow it which is so gross and uncomfortable and eventually gives me heart burn and discomfort. 

Could this be something beyond asthma? I have a doctors appointment regarding my asthma in a few days and will bring this up but would love some input from other sufferers. Thanks in advance!"
"Hey y‚Äôall, so a year ago, I moved from up north to Tennessee. I noticed a few times up north after laughing real hard that afterwards I could hear ‚Äúbreathing sounds‚Äù or sometimes a wheeze. When I moved to TN, I noticed it happening more. Going for runs, going out with friends, laughing, goofing off, ya know. Went to a doc, got an inhaler, it definitely helps. I know allergies are worse down here, and that might be part of it, but idk if that‚Äôs the full story. Almost every time I hang out with anyone or laugh over a phone call, I can hear those sounds. No chest tightness, no fatigue, just super annoying. I am 420 friendly in the evenings, and hit a juul only a couple times a day. I‚Äôm aware those are probably a contributing factor, but never really effected me up north. I had asthma when I was a kid, and now it‚Äôs returned I guess. Does anyone else experience this? Could it be anything more than just asthma?"

"
I used to have what was believed to be exercise-induced asthma when I was an adolescent. I used to experience difficulty breathing after running. In addition, I would wheeze, cough and have difficulty speaking.

I‚Äôve been experiencing a headache, slightly sore throat which comes and goes. I‚Äôve suffered from fairly persistent dizziness, especially upon standing. When I walk, I feel extremely dizzy, as if I‚Äôll fall forward. In addition, I‚Äôve been plagued by persistent fatigue and malaise.

I‚Äôve been experiencing shortness of breath upon minimal exertion (for example, climbing a flight of stairs or walking.) I feel as though I‚Äôve devoid of energy, rendering even walking to the bus stop, which is only a few blocks away a laborious task. 
I‚Äôve been walking slowly and avoiding running and excessive walking when possible. This was not the case a few weeks ago. For some reason, my stamina appears to have significantly decreased.

The most worrying symptoms, however are the persistent feelings of pressure and tightness in my chest. I also feel like my throat is itchy, or as if there is food stuck in it, which makes it difficult and unpleasant to eat. Sometimes I feel as though I can‚Äôt take a complete breath, and other times, normal activity causes me to feel short of breath. 

I‚Äôve noticed over the past couple of months that when I exert myself, it feels as though my throat is closing or someone is choking me. My heart beats more rapidly than usual. Lying down on my stomach tends to exacerbate these feelings.

I visited the urgent care center, had virtual visit and saw a doctor on Monday because it was believed that I was suffering from a sinus infection. However, when the doctors pressed on my sinuses, I did not feel pain, and I am not very congested. I‚Äôve been prescribed two different antibiotics and am almost finished taking the second one. 

The throat and chest tightness have continued unabated.

These symptoms have been ongoing for about two weeks. I had a negative COVID test the Friday before last, as well as last Tuesday.

I was seen in the emergency room this past Friday. I had shortness of breath in the car on route to the hospital. It felt like speaking was an effort.

I was prescribed an albuterol inhaler, which unfortunately has not brought me any relief. In fact, last night, my throat felt so tight that I didn‚Äôt want to eat dinner. I also felt weak and fatigued. I am loath to return to the doctor as this will be the fifth time since January.

I dismissed my symptoms as psychosomatic as I suffer from severe anxiety and have diagnosed anxiety disorders.

When I was examined in the ER, the doctor told me that I did not appear particularly anxious. Nor have I felt exceptionally or significantly more anxious since the onset of these symptoms. 

Does anyone have any advice?"
"So I am looking for some advice as I am at my wit's end.

My son who is 5 has extremely bad asthma. He also has bad allergies to dust and pollen which make the situation worse. We have spent god knows how much time is hospital with him on the nebuliser

He is such an active little boy too and can never sit still. We have him on two inhalers. The blue one and the orange flexitide one.  So with these two inhalers it has made things a lot better he can go out and play fine and not be gasping for air. The only issue is at night when in his room he coughs constantly non stop. So most nights my wife takes him into the bed and I go sleep on couch..when in our bed the coughing completely stops. My wife scrubs his room top to bottom every two days there is not a spec of dust in it. He also has anti allergy blankets. He gets himself into such bad coughing fits that he gets sick sometimes. I know this might be more allergy related but it seems to be all connected. Could anyone here have any idea what this could be?"

"when I was little, (in elementary and middle) I used to keep my inhaler in the school nurse's office, I continued to go and ask the teacher out at break (that's when my asthma acted up the most) if I could get my inhaler from the office. most of them said yes, and I would go, some of them were a\*\*es though and would be like ""oh no I don't think you need it"", ""you don't have asthma"", ""you aren't having an asthma attack"" that last comment happened at least 3 or 4 times. 

i started to carry my inhaler by myself in grade 8. I was fed up with teachers not letting me use it. 

in grade 4, I was playing out on the playground and I had needed my inhaler, really bad and you could clearly see me struggling to get a breath in. I went up to the nearest teacher and asked if I could get my inhaler from the office. of course, being the stupid teacher she was, said ""oh no, you're not having an asthma attack, you don't need your inhaler, *just take deep breaths""* yeah.. ill start taking deep breaths if you would let me get my inhaler, stupid.  I found a different teacher and by the time I got to the office, I was struggling to get even a half a breath in. I think I almost passed out that day. 

**""Breathing exercises""**

do they actually work for people? when I'm having an asthma attack, the last thing I plan on doing is intentionally not taking my inhaler and doing ""breathing exercises."""
"So I‚Äôve been having this asthma flare up for about a week now I‚Äôve missed the whole week of school on the nebulizer every 5 hours, 60 mg of prednisone and a bunch of other pills.

I looked up the information why I was prescribed that Breezhaler as it uses mainly to treat COPD, although my pulmo has not rule out any diagnosis yet, he requested a pulmo function test in next week. I am a little concerned tbh, since I know COPD is a progressive lung decease and it will get worse over time with lower life expectancy, most of people have asthma will develop COPD in 40s if they smoke, but I am only 26, I do not even smoke or second smoker. I have a whole life a head of me and I am just really scared right now.

[Can asthma cause emphysema? What are the Risks?](https://preview.redd.it/fvdva4cnkrm81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40605325f81417bf6fa4f6fb85a41aacbffd743e)

Patients with asthma face several complications due to their congested oxygen sacs, such as Emphysema. That‚Äôs because asthma makes your respiratory system vulnerable, and it is susceptible to any hazardous substances entering it. In this regard, there are various risks associated with asthma causing emphysema.  


*So, let‚Äôs pen them down for you.*  


**What is Emphysema?**  
Emphysema is a chronic respiratory disease that can develop gradually through mild respiratory disorders. In emphysema, the lungs‚Äô alveoli are destroyed with lung tissue damage. This condition does not let the oxygen pass through the blood vessel and creates a big bag of air in the lungs resulting in the blockage of breathing.   
**How can Asthma Cause Emphysema?**  
Asthma is a respiratory condition that can also become a stimulating factor for encouraging emphysema to occur. That‚Äôs because asthma is a prevalent disease, and people most probably develop this disease early in their lives. The causes of asthma are not precisely known, but it is more likely to be transmitted through genes or caused by allergens.   


However, once you are diagnosed with asthma, it does not cure with treatments but can only be controlled through inhalers. In this regard, patients who have developed asthma early in their lives may experience emphysema later in their lives since the inflamed bronchi and oxygen sacs can deteriorate over time leading to lung tissue damages. Additionally, acute asthma attacks caused by excessive smoking can also trigger emphysema.   


**Risks**  
Emphysema is an acute respiratory disease that can associate several health risks. For example, asthma-caused emphysema can induce symptoms of lung damage, pneumothorax, cardiac failures, bullae (holes in lungs). These diseases are life-threatening and can incur in case of avoiding treatments. 

**Treatment**  
If you have developed asthma early in life, there are certain things to avoid not to cause emphysema. That‚Äôs because the primary cause of emphysema is that patients with asthma do not maintain their lifestyle by taking precautions for preventing acute prolonged asthma such as smoking. Moreover, avoiding proper medication for asthma can also deteriorate the situation. However, you can buy [Clenil,](https://www.pharmacyplanet.com/clenil-inhaler.html) Spiriva, and [Symbicort inhalers online in the Uk](https://www.pharmacyplanet.com/symbicort-turbohaler.html) to control your asthma."
"I‚Äôm currently getting pain in my upper back, it doesn‚Äôt really feel muscular, it gets bad when lying on it her relieves when pressure is off. Breathing in deeply I have mild discomfort across the chest. When I started the breeze inhaler I had this but it went away while using it. Came off of it 3 weeks ago, and my lungs were feeling better, but last couple of days it has started to spiral down with increase pain in the back, last time I had intense pain in the lower ribs each side that felt like a knife twisting, but once again day on the breeze inhaler it disappeared. I also woke up feeling crappy and short of breath before work (doing the Nightshift) and the pain increased. Have taken asmol puffer out still some discomfort when breathing in deeply sometimes even shallow. Does this sound conveyed to asthma? I do have another course of breeze inhaler if I needed it. But we wanted to see if I would improve after it (which I did) but now going back down. I do have a doctors appointment coming up tho thankfully 

Thank you in advance for any responses and for reading the long ramble :)"
"Hi, I have asthma, eczema and allergies and I have been looking into how to reduce the risk of these diseases in my future children (I'm 30f). Just out of the hope that they won't have to go through what I am going through.

I wanted to share a great book I just read: Grow Healthy Babies (ps. I have no affiliation with this book, purely sharing my experience). [https://www.growhealthybabies.com/](https://www.growhealthybabies.com/)

The authors reviewed 700+ scientific publications and present everything we know up to now, on this topic (incl. the level of confidence). I have done research in this area and I found it very accurate, and at the same time easy to understand for everyone. 

It's crazy how much is known on this and how people could actually take action, I felt the urge to share!!

What do you think and do you have any other similar resource to recommend? Please share if you have any other insights on this topic. Thanks!"
Does this happen for anyone else? It is always the day before rain(or snow) where I just have to take my rescue inhaler a good amount and then the day it rains I‚Äôm usually better. Is there anything I can do to relieve this?
"Lesson learned, so I thought I'd share it with you folks here. But let me give some context. Sorry if this is long. 

Since Christmas we've been nailed by at least 6 respiratory viruses in our family, Covid included. I've had to go on a course of Prednisone 3 times. This last virus has been the worst of all of them (yes even worse than Covid). So last Wednesday I was taking my meds and I noticed I was out of Prednisone. I always put them in a little pill container for the week so I figured I somehow miscounted and forgot to fill the rest of the week. I looked in the cabinet for the bottle to get some more but it was empty.

Here's my excuse: I had been on and off Prednisone so many times in the past three months, I was just used to taking every day. Now, what I *should* have done at that point was call my doctor and tell him what happened. He could have prescribed me another week or so at a lower dosage and I could have tapered like I normally do, albeit, just a bit longer. But I thought to myself, *""It's no big deal. I've taken it dozens of times and never had any problems.""* Little did I know.

By Thursday afternoon I was feeling unusually fatigued, like *""I hope I'm not getting the flu""* fatigued. I had a headache and slight chills. My first thought was that my lingering cough might be turning into walking pneumonia, something that's happened before. But I also knew that I had been getting terrible sleep because of my cough, so maybe it was just that.

Friday I was worse. It was my day off, and I stayed home with our toddler while my wife went to work for the morning. I let him sit on the couch and watch *Blippi* while I just laid there. That evening I spiked a fever of 102 and just felt awful. I was fearful it was either pneumonia or I had gotten the flu. It was at that moment I remembered not tapering. I Googled *""Prednisone withdrawal symptoms""* and, bingo, there it was. Everything I was experiencing being described by others. 

It got worse. I would spike fevers randomly and shiver. I had night sweats and barely had any appetite at all. I ached all over, got diarrhea, dizziness, my eyes burned, I had severe fatigue. Monday morning I immediately went in to see the doctor. She tested me for flu - negative. They did an x-ray - clear. Blood test showed no infection. She agreed that what I was dealing with was almost certainly from stopping Prednisone abruptly.

Fast forward to today and this is the first day I've felt a little bit normal in a week. I'd say that I'm about 70% now, but that's huge progress. I had a  chill just once today but it didn't last, and I finally had some energy and appetite back. But still it's 10:45 in the evening here as I write this and I'm definitely completely wiped out. 

The moral of the story is this my fellow asthmatics, **don't stop Prednisone suddenly!** Like I said, I've taken it dozens of times over my lifetime and never had a problem. I though *""I got this.""* Trust me, unless you want to feel miserable for a week (or possibly longer), **don't stop it suddenly and** **don't skip the taper.** If you forget about the taper, contact your doctor immediately! If you've been on Prednisone for a while, you're sick and tired of the jitters and weight gain, and your tempted to just stop, DON'T! Again, contact your doctor for advice. The End."
"Hello, I have 5 year who we believe has asthma. She‚Äôs had a few sever to mild episodes in the last 6 months and looking for some help. 

The first was out of no where. We were playing at the park and then within 15 minutes loses her voice and develops a cough. We assumed she got a weird cold as she had been playing in the river and it was quite cold. The next day she had really heavy labored breathing. When they checked her oxygen level it was at 87-88. She wouldn‚Äôt take a breathing treatment (she has level 1 austim ) due to the noise of the nebulizer scaring. Her oxygen at the point was 87-89 the screaming during her melt down pushed it to 94. They gave her a steroid shot and amoxicillin as they thought it might bacterial pneumonia. She got better the next day and her oxygen was normal and her lungs sounded fine. They gave an albuterol inhaler and told to try and use if we can. She want having it but still got better fast.  

Jump to November and she had a similar episode but way less sever and we didn‚Äôt take her to the doctor. She had a low grade fever and a cough, but again wasn‚Äôt anything we felt we needed to worry about and it went away in about a day. 

Then in January she had an episode. She had a runny nose and congestion, no fever (which tripped us up), gnarly cough, and labored breathing. Oxygen was around 91-92. Her chest wasn‚Äôt clinging to her ribs but she working to breath. The first doctor didn‚Äôt prescribe a steroid shot and told us to try the albuterol inhaler we had and sent us home but my wife and I knew how it was going to go. We decided to try instacare for a second opinion as we weren‚Äôt interested in having to hear her struggling. They gave us an oral steroid and thankfully my wife and I were able to convince my daughter to try the nebulizer with a mask. She got better very quickly and they gave us like 75 doses of Albuterol and we purchased a nebulizer as well. She got better in about a day. Pppp

She had another today. I knew it was coming as she had been congested for a few days and yesterday started coughing up some mucus and this morning was hacking gobs of it and steadily got worst as the day went on. The cough eventually moved to a dry persistent one. No fever and her oxygen been around 91-92 and around 94-95 after a treatment ever 4 hours. I feel that we should have ran to the instacare for a steroid but we decided against since she was better after the treatments. She‚Äôs had a running nose but no mucus coming up when she coughs. 

Long story long, what are some basics for a plan and what I am looking at here? She coughs when she runs around but nothing huge or intervention worthy but we tell her to slow down and we get her some water. Where she has daycare there are dogs but that doesn‚Äôt trigger anything. The weather shifted quite a bit and it went from 65 to lows teens in a day so we think maybe a cold or Allergies got her this week or something. 

I‚Äôm looking for some advice. We are getting an appointment with a doc to set a plan, but I want to know what others are doing. She‚Äôs not at a point where I think she‚Äôd take an inhaler, but don‚Äôt know. She also doesn‚Äôt have anything that is consistent for us to point to. 

Thanks"
I've had asthma my whole life but I only get symptoms after I smoke. I get prescribed medical marijuana for pinched nerves in my neck from bone spurs. My symptoms after I smoke are not that bad just enough to use my inhaler. But I use my inhaler 10 times a day. My doctor told me I shouldn't be using that much and I could be doing long term damage. The question I have is can the slight symptoms I get after smoking cause the same long term effects as having regular asthma attacks everyday.

Woke up this morning. Was coughing for about 10 mins straight. Felt like I couldn't get air in. Took 10 Puffs of ventolin and I eventually stopped coughing. Didn't do peaks. Was last thing on my mind. Was getting annoyed the coughing wouldn't stop and would've called 999 if it didn't stop

"I just got a fitness tracker that can measure blood oxygen levels. Whenever I've been measured at the doctor ive been at least 98% and last night I was 97-99%.

Today I've been feeling a little lightheaded so I started measuring my blood oxygen and I've been at 92-93% when breathing ""normally"" and occasionally dipping down below 90%. If I take some deep breaths then it goes back up to 95+.

I don't feel any symptoms other than a bit of a cough (which I've had for like 2 weeks), which is actually less symptoms than usual. My peak flow is fine. I'm just a bit lightheaded. Is this normal or is this a situation that I should be using a rescue inhaler for?"
"I was prescribed this medication for asthma, but I‚Äôm afraid to take it since I‚Äôve never tried this type (daily powder inhalation route). In the past I have only used a nebulizer for bronchitis. I like that type since it‚Äôs adding moisture as well. What should I expect the first time I try Breo? How can I alleviate the fear and panic the first time?"
"My fiance and I are expecting a baby girl this summer. My fiance is asthmatic (I gave up smoking for her) and she doesn't have severe asthma but usually in the spring she gets allergies and would start using her meds and inhaler during that time. However, since becoming pregnant my fiance her asthma has been flaring up. She talked the doctor and ask which meds are safe and wouldn't affect the child but she's been using her inhaler (and as I'm writing this - she's in bed using her nebulizer).

Does pregnancy affect asthma? And will it affect the child? Will our child have asthma or is it unrelated?"
"I‚Äôve been admitted to the hospital for 13 hours, and no improvement. Still feeling chest tightness and back pain plus difficulty in breathing. My pulmo asked me to be admitted but never saw her again she‚Äôs gonna check up on me in the morning, she just wrote down all the instructions. They administer iv steriods every 4 hours it doesn‚Äôt make me feel better only my oxygen level is back to normal 80 to 99. In the past doctors diagnose acute bronchitis and give zoltox or cefuroxime and they immediately work. My new doctor didn‚Äôt I havent slept for 12 hrs. I was given nebulizer(doesnt work), bronchidilator, seretide, oxygen &amp; iv. Any temporary relief?"
"Hello M 26 here. I just wanted to get some advice &amp; some encouragement. I started living with my partner around April 2020‚Äô .  He had carpet &amp; a dog &amp; my asthma started to progress &amp; get really bad as I did have asthma all my life &amp; when I lived with my mom it was controlled &amp; I was fine. We had a cat at my moms house when I was younger &amp; carpet but it would cost me trips to the emergency. I spent a lot of time at the hospital even weeks at a time due to my asthma. My mom completely renovated the apartment. Getting rid of the carpet as well as the cat. She tried to let me have a bird but due to the smell of it had to get rid of it. :-( but my asthma was totally fine unless I was in an environment that would trigger it like dust, or animals to close to me. 

now fast forward living with my partner. My asthma started to progress as he has carpet &amp; a dog. &amp; not to mention I was dealing w/ a lot of stress as many others did due to the pandemic. It caused me so much anxiety. He would vacuum daily &amp; clean up &amp; wash the dog often. We finally got rid of the carpet a year ago &amp; it did help somewhat. We also re painted the entire apartment because the paint was chipping &amp; suspected it also can contribute to my health. So we noticed under the carpet by the air conditioner in our bedroom that there is a bit of mold. It‚Äôs just so much to deal with. Not to mention I dealt with the passing of two of my family members last year. My asthma became completely out of control. I would take my nebulizer every other day. Use my asthma pump like twice a day. I purchased a bissell air purifier but I think that it may not be effective enough.

I went to my pulmonologist he prescribed me with a steroid inhaler (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder) &amp; singular. It helps but it has really bad side effects for me like Acne, mood changes, yeast infections. I also went completely vegan hoping that it would help &amp; it did to a degree but my asthma just bothers me sometimes. Does stress trigger asthma this bad?

This is just a really unfortunate situation for me because I do care very much for my partner &amp; I always wanted a dog but ‚Ä¶ my health is far more important. Idk what to say to my partner anymore because he‚Äôs totally fine &amp; the way my environment has effects on me it doesn‚Äôt have on him at all. He smokes &amp; lives life. Should I just consider walking away from this relationship? Are there any holistic routes I can take? I really don‚Äôt want to be on this steroid anymore‚Ä¶ thank you for taking the time to read I know it is a lot I just need some advice &amp; encouragement."
"Hello! I'm a student at Iowa State University studying Industrial Design. This semester, I'm working to design a product for those with poor respiratory health. I would like to collect some data to make informed decisions on my form of design, ergonomic properties, and the user's experience. Surface level research has shown me that those with lung health issues do not use peak flow meters super often, so I would like to inform this research with the experience of those who may use one. 

All questions are optional. This survey is anonymous. [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPeN43kBZMH1yXSk7VHoOed4\_V-LqvvkLgn0TjH\_ob6IS-kg/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPeN43kBZMH1yXSk7VHoOed4_V-LqvvkLgn0TjH_ob6IS-kg/viewform?usp=sf_link)"
"My 7yo son was diagnosed with asthma just before he turned 4. This followed a case of RSV that led to pneumonia and a 3-day hospital stay. Since then, most of the symptoms of his asthma--including his SO2 and his tendency to cough to the point of vomiting during intense physical activity--are completely managed. 

One thing still makes life difficult: when a common headcold makes its way through the house, the rest of us (we're a family of 4) deal with it in a couple of days. Mine might last five or six, with nights of occasional coughing but nothing that has me up all night. (I was diagnosed as asthmatic three years ago.) My son, on the other hand, spends several nights in hell, with complete congestion, sore throat, and a cough that is sometimes productive, sometimes dry. The days are fine; he is up and about and moving, But at night, he gets little sleep. 

I'm up with him right now at 4am. He's completely lucid and his SO2 is 99%. His asthma regimen is 44mcg fluticasone inhaler 2x2 times/day. We almost never use his albuterol inhaler. 

Here are the things we try to help him manage these colds:

* Zyrtec and Azelastine. (I know these are antihistamines, but at the first sign of symptoms, it's not always clear whether this is a virus or case of allergies. He got a scratch test from an allergist last year; the \~60 allergens were all negative. 
* Guaifenesin+Dextromethorphan. 
* Ibuprofen
* Oxymetazoline. I never use this more than three nights in a row, and I only use it at night. But when he's congested, it's the only thing that works.
* Flonase
* Steam showers
* A spoonful of honey, and/or honey tea
* Throat lollipops
* Saline nasal spray
* A convoluted configuration of pillows to help keep up somewhat upright in bed

All of these feel like symptom management. Sometimes certain tools are better than others. In these moments, my ability to approach this scientifically goes out the window and I just throw the kitchen sink at the problem, hoping that something will make him feel better. 

I'm looking for advice. Why does it take his immune system so long to calm down from these colds? Are they related to his asthma or not? And what medications/homeopathic remedies should I be using more than others?"

"I‚Äôm so sick with what I believe to be bronchitis from a cold and my breathing ofc is a little weak. I have a nasty cough, slight chest pain, fatigue, etc. Has anyone had good experiences with NyQuil for bronchitis / flu / cold?

"When i was young my parents thought i was asthmatic which hearing back on it seemed like they over reacted. I had inhalers prescribed to me back when i was 8 and that carried on till 11. The thing is i barely had to use the inhalers, i never once had an asthma attack and my fitness was alright, never really wheezed just deep breaths as it exercise. I am now 18 and now I realised that my parents may have exaggerated my symptoms. I would like to have my GP test me if i am correct or not, i wouldn't really want to have a disease on my medical record even though its not really true. does anyone know a way to get it as a misdiagnosis, or just completely get it off my medical record. what should i say to say to my doctor about this. Do i just completely go on like this post, or is there another way to go on about this"

I have asthma. The past few years I would get mild forms of what I now know is ‚Äòdyspnea‚Äô. I feel as if I have to yawn to get that deep breath and really struggle to get if not. This usually lasts a few hours then I‚Äôll be okay but was just wondering if anyone knows how to deal with this really uncomfortable feeling
"Normally I had very light asthma, using my rescue puffer maybe one a month at month.

Last 3 weeks it‚Äôs been constant, but my ventolin doesn‚Äôt really have much of an effect.

On 5 days of Prednisolone but haven‚Äôt noticed an improvement, 2 weeks of symbicort too but no results.

It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt speak a sentence but rather chest is tight and I can‚Äôt take a full breath. It‚Äôs just flaring on it own.

Family friend Dr suggested I try Bleo Elipta, has anyone had any success with that over symbicort?

Thanks 

Had a chest X-ray to be reviewed tomorrow and lung function test on the weekend."
I've been taking Flovent HFA for three now is it safe to take these inhalers for such a long time? if I don't take my health get more worse.
"For over a week I've had a tickly throat, cough, blocked/runny nose. Thought it was just a normal cold and that it'll pass soon. When w week passed and I was still the same, I decided to buy some over the counter cold meds; benilyne tickly/chesty cough syrup (orange one), and when that didn't work I got a shops own brand ""chesty cough and cold"" sachets because hey, hydration. (Really regret not buying tablets though. Powdered painkillers are disgusting). Over next few days my sympts seemed to get worse AND my phlem was beginning to turn yellow. Now I think I got it from my brother, who turned out to have a chest viral infection and is on antibiotics. So I book an app to speak to a Dr (didn't get my preferred Dr). 

This grumpy old Dr, who I'm sure only actually helps certain patients, treats the rest of us on a ""are rush on their deathbed?"" On sight diagnosis. He completely ignored my cold symptoms, the phlem changing colour, and gave me another history lesson on asthma and ppl's misconceptions on how they think it relates to colds. When I persisted he simply gave me an app to see him in a couple days, and mentioned he'll probably just give me some counter medicine. The whole reason of going to a Dr is to maybe get something stronger which will help with Mt worsening cold symptoms.
  
TLDR; worsening cold symptoms, possible chest infection? Can't really breathe or talk properly, crap old Dr just says to take more of my browm inhaler. Is it all iny head? Should I change surgeries?"
"I went to hand the GP a form or something and she goes ‚Äúoh my god your fingers are blue!‚Äù

"22male non smoker
early exposure to biomass fuels smoke dust around my house 
I used to experience lungs discomfort at rest in my teenage years(around 12 year old) for some months and then it would go away or become less severe after some time. After some years this lung discomfort become constant and less tolerable with phlegm, coughing and SOB when doing sports or running.I started taking cough medicines some allergy pills and avoided doing anything heavy. One year later I got infected with pulmonary TB and thereafter my symptoms of lungs discomfort coughing phlegm became more severe that I had to stop my study and become bedridden. Visited many Docs taken many medicines still don't know what's really I've been suffering from. I had got done many tests (CT scan spirometry pft bronchoscopy) two years ago and all came out to be normal. My FEV1/FVC was 89.5%."
"Does anyone else attend edm festivals with severe asthma? I went to Okeechobee over the weekend. There was huge dust clouds, I had my first asthma attack. I was coughing for over an hour, every time I tried to talk I couldn‚Äôt bc I was so short of breath. The more I tried to talk the harder it was to breathe. I did breathing treatments at my camp site, used my inhaler in the festival. I‚Äôm curious is there some kind of mask I can wear for dusty environments like that? Like a gas mask to filter out all the dust? One that I could wear all day at an outdoor environment like this?"
"I noticed that every time I took a beta agonist (both short and long acting ones, at different times) I get this dull pressure/ tightness/ numbness in my left chest and arm. 

For example; 

I‚Äôd take my albuterol inhaler one day- noticed that strange feeling, lasted about a full days length, then left. 

With flovent, I never got this feeling. I had to switch though because I still got short of breath. 

Started on advair, that weird feeling came back. It only happens when I take beta agonists? 

I already reached out to my doctor, but I just don‚Äôt want to lose sleep lol, and wanted to know if anyone else went through this? I just recently got diagnosed, and am trying to figure out the best med for me. 

It‚Äôs just the left side too, not overall chest- it‚Äôs strange."
"After I use my inhaler it causes me to cough for at least 30 or 40 minutes to clear my throat.

Any good solutions?"
"Aftrr developing Covid in June last year, I ended up with a really bad case of sinusitis. Still going. No doctor would tell me anything other than to use streoid nasal sprays bur after using them multiple times a day just to breathe, i got sick. Tested every treatment I could before going back to the doctors and saying I couldnt breathe through my nose and nothing was working to fix the issue. 

Today I had a doctor ask me if theres a chance i am asthmatic to see if its a reason my siuses are acting up. I said no but that my grandparents did have it as does one of my cousins that I knew of. 

When I mentioned it to my mother, she informed me I did actually have Asthma as a child but grew out of it. After conferring with a friend who is getting their doctorate, they told me that Covid has affected my lungs more than I thought and, because of my sinuses being really bad, has brought the asthma back into full swing. I feel like my lungs are constantly on fire lately but always chalked it up to not being able to get the air in because i couldnt breathe through my nose properly...nope, asthma I didnt know I even had until I am 26.

If id known that, I probably would have been WAY more cautious than I had been before I got covid to begin with and wore a mask more often at work. (I know I got Covid from work. I wouldn't leave the house otherwise.)"

"First time posting so i was thinking of sharing my story.

So my childhood journey was difficult. I have severe chronic asthma with dairy allergy's. I flat lined three times. No treatment was working. I was on all the meds. I even had Immunoglobulin therapy. 

I grew up in and out of hospital. I had 3 young friends. A boy with down syndrome and twins with cystic fibrosis. I still remember the day they died. 

Teenage years were hard. I attempted suicide. Survived. 
My outlook was bleak. I drank a lot made stupid mistakes.

 I released doctors family or friends were not going to help it was on me so I decided to eat better and exercise. I promised myself I'd give it a year. A lot of hard work and here are some of my accomplishments within the last 3 years

‚Ä¢ ran two 1/2 Marathons
‚Ä¢ completed two sprint triathlon
‚Ä¢ swam 3km
‚Ä¢ blue belt in BJJ  (even competed didn't go well)
‚Ä¢ in the process of doing a masters degree
‚Ä¢ got married
‚Ä¢ bought and renovated a home ( just my wife, father And myself)
‚Ä¢ lost 10kg in weight. 

If I can do this anyone can. Never forget everything we accomplish is harder for us. Keep moving forward.

Got covid the first time nearly been a week and feel like its going into my lungs coughing and wheezing and it hurts to take deep breaths.
"Don't you just love it when people pretend like they know how to fix your asthma? 

&amp;#x200B;

""Maybe if you exercised more you would not have asthma."" 

Well Karen, every time I do anything more than walking I have an asthma attack and can not breathe. My doctor has literally told me its not safe to put myself in these situations when I have severe **uncontrolled** asthma. Maybe if I did not have to breathe in your cigarette smoke every time I am around you I would not have asthma. 

&amp;#x200B;

""It sucks you needed to take oral steroids 6 times last year and twice you had to take them for over a month, but maybe you should just not take them. If you do not take them you will be able to lose the weight you keep gaining from the steroids.""

"I have tried so many fucking preventatives that don't work in the least, and the one that I find that makes it like I don't even have asthma cannot be covered by my insurance. Anyone got an alternative to Trelegy? I'm going to try Breo but I think the umeclinidium is whats doing it for me."

"I have only ever had 2 asthma attacks in my life i am 30 now. The only reason for these is because of me not having my inhaler near by after a coughing fit in winter, so it just got progressively worse. I use my inhaler from time to time probably more than i should. Allot of it is telling myself is it my asthma or my anxiety. Also I know people can get out of breath from time time which is completely normal. Every time i do a peak flow it‚Äôs always 500 and above but averagely 550."

"My bf keeps on having nocturnal asthma at my place and we tried everything ‚Äì new bed, air purifier with humidifier, new bedsheets, new pillow.  He plans to move in with me but it seems he cannot sleep here at all. I live with a cat. Up until the cat was 5 months he had no problems while staying at my place. I neutered the cat as soon as it was medically possible. We moved the bedroom so pets have no access to it. When we did that, the first night was relatively okay but the second night was not. My guess is it was because we were putting up some new furniture and were drilling a lot, so the room was dusty, but I am starting to lose any hope. Is there something else I can do or do I have to get rid of the cat? And will it help? It will break my heart, but at this point I am willing to try anything. Also, my bf lived with two cats before and had no problems whatsoever."

"Hello there,

My asthma is severe and I need to vent. I am only 21 and I remember one (!) day this year where I was absolutly fine without any issue and without oral steroids. Apart from that, I am exhausted every day, out of breath when I climb stairs or for no reason at all and in pain more than not. But, still, I function decently. Hell, I even do sports and go runnig!

But, it is just so hard to keep up with all this stuff. I need steroids right now. My doctor messed my perscription up, so I had to call a BUNCH of people to get everything in place. Just to survive tomorrow, you know. I tried to call a gyno, but even though I cried on the phone, it took me an hour to find one to help me without half a year. I have to go to physical therapy at the moment, because there is a slim chance it might help. It does, for a few hours, but the therapist is ill, so I will travel 1,5 hours just for the steroids. It took me two hours today up until this point, because no doctor picked up their phone anytime soon, and I am soooo tired of all this. I just want to go to sleep, but I can't. I have already wasted two hours, more to come. The next infection is just around the corner, so wait for the new episode of me being done with anything next week. 

I don't want anything crazy. I just want to function normally and get my stuff done - or a day off. This would be fine, too.

Sorry for being such a baby about it, I just needed to get it all out, so I can go on with my day. If you have recommendations for being more efficient, feel free, I might need it. If you need to vent, too, go ahead. I will hype your achievements today, because let's be honest, nobody congratulates you for the things you achieve in order to stay alive. It's a chronic illness inside joke, I guess."
"he made a post after of him getting treatment with a positive caption saying the new album took his breath away . i swear i could never be as positive as him , last time my asthma was real bad i was so depressed . i wanted to make this post because i been a fan of him for a year and also because his positivity and able to make humour of the situation inspired me üñ§üñ§"
I'm getting my first dose on March 25th and am just curious about others experiences.
I used to have more stamina. I get out of breath easily and I hate it. I used to be more able to do sport and stuff.
"So i work in a hotel that is NO smoking and customarily carries a 250 $$ fine for those who break it which they agree to in writing. Often however this does not deter short or long term stays from smoking in this cold climate indoors. I have a feeling that the alarms are being tampered with. I hate it as well as I have asthma and masks have failed to help me and our way of cleaning is insufficientt to reduce exposure to the chemicals and smell in cigarette smoke. Anyone know of reasonable cost solutions to this issue i could propose to my employer?? I like my job otherwise so please don't suggest just quitting, it is the minority of people that do this but it's still at least once per week I'm exposed."
"When I take a deep breath the center of my upper chest and lower neck feel tight every time I take a really deep breath, is this normal?"
"so i  have  been having difficult breathing  often my doctor says it looks like you have allergic asthma.  to  start using an emergency asthma inhaler he never gave me an official test sometimes the symptoms can get a inconsistent which sometimes leads me to doubt i have it

like I'm allergic to cats but my brothers cat always following me around  I'm not always having a reaction

should i ask him for the test or continue with original plan 

i have other conditions like a panic attack disorder too"
"I have a mild asthma and allergy (dust mites, cats). Currently no medications as my doctor said my symptoms are too mild. I used to take medications for 10 years and go to dust mite allergy treatment for 5 years (injections).

But I'm still sensitive to ""indoor"" air. I mean I still have headaches from dust, or dry air.

When I'm outside I feel great, I love the fresh air. 

But when I come back from a walk to my apartment building I feel like a ""cloud"" of indoor air. I feel as if the dust was getting immediately to my lungs. I hate this feeling. Also I have the smell in my building. I hate the smell of concrete, hate the smell of paint, dirty doormats, or wood from the doors. 

Then, I feel slightly nauseated, get a slight ""brain fog"" as if the dust was getting into my brain. I feel slightly dull indoors and less focused.

Does someone feel that way as well?"

"So I'm taking my budesonid spray for my mild allergic asthma for almost 3 months already. The good thing is, my house dust allergy got much better. I barely cough. 
But the bad news is, I have a few new symptoms showing up on me and I always thought it was something else. After taking budesonid in the morning, I get chest palpitations and very fast pulse while standing or walking. Usually, getting ready in my bathroom makes my pulse go up to 110bpm. I also feel very tired in general, but the racing heart and labored breathing which comes with it, is much scarier. It gets worse with physical activity. 

I also am sleeping terribly. My pulse is quite high during sleeping. Thanks to my fitbit measuring it all for me. 

Could this be something else or are these normal budesonid adverse effects? If yes, does that mean I shouldn't take steroid medication anymore? What is the alternative? I have had breathing problems for over 4 years now."
Can it last me a whole year? How long can i stretch its use for? The idea of pay $25 bucks a month for this seems steep.
I‚Äôm a 21f and I‚Äôve been taking montelukast since maybe my junior year of high school. In the past two years my anxiety and mental health have suffered insanely because of this pandemic and my health issues and I‚Äôve been reading a lot about the effects of montelukast and how it was JUST recently published about how badly it can effect ur mental health. Has anyone stopped taking it and seen an improvement or has started taking it a noticed a decline? I wanna ask my doctor to slowly stop taking it just to see if it‚Äôll help improve anything but I‚Äôve been taking it for so long I‚Äôm scared to see how my body will react to it. Anyone have any stories or advice?! Anything is helpful!!
"Im dont have asthma but I do take symbicort and ventolin for my yearly bouts of bronchitis caused by virus. The coughs would stick for like 4-6 months before one year i finally decided to stop sticking it out and see what meds i can take. Doc prescribed me ventolin and symbicort. Ive been reading up on them and apparently ventolin can cause damage in the long run. Im worried because ive been on them 4 times the past year or so with only a couple months between. My regimine is basically 2 puffs each inhaler, once in the morning and once at night for two weeks. My anxieties kicking in and am wondering how much ventolin is concerning and if i should just take symbicort on its own (which would be ideal for me as it would decrease the amount side effects i feel)?"

"When I was in the hospital they kept forgetting to give me a singulair for about a week and then I had surgery and I had an asthma attack when waking up. I am scared of that happening again, I've had several surgeries and was fine. Has anyone had an asthma attack in one surgery then was fine for the next?"
"Air purifier suggestions? My room is 330sq ft and I‚Äôd love to get an air purifier for it before renovations are done.

I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm horrible with replacing heppa filters every month so I prefer something without them. Also they get hella expensive.

I have asthma and hyaline membrane disease."
"I have allergic asthma that occurs year round ""persistent asthma"". Since I have been feeling very run down and tired for many months now I decided to try vitamin D3. I noticed after taking 400IU of vitamin D3 for a week my tiredness has reduced and my asthma has lessened slightly.

Is this just a coincidence or does vitamin D3 help my immune system from overreacting? Has anyone looked into this?"
"18 Male, 9.7 stones


I am having shortness of breath whilst I was laying down and got up and was very unbalanced and weak. I used my inhaler about 2-3 hours ago and I still feel like I can't get a deap breath and constantly take small breaths, feel weak and light headed and weakness in both hands."


"My doc prescribed me 25mg metoprolol to help me control heart palpitations which I have because of my anxiety.
I was just about to take it when I found out that it can affect badly my Asthma.
So is anyone here using metoprolol based medicine and did it made your Asthma worse?"
"Hi all, I've been an asthmatic since early teanage years and have recently been possibly exposed to covid, I want to how have there been anything recently that confirms any serious complications for 'controlled' asthmatics?"
Ever notice how in movies when someone is anxious they just start smacking the inhaler ? Nerdy? Inhaler.
But I gotta pay a 350 premium a month for functioning lungs.
"So I have a seriously annoying problems: I now know that my recent flare-ups of post-exercise 'asthma' are brought on by either low potassium or magnesium (you need to fix Mg to also fix K, and both together help). Doctors are useless in that respect and have no idea what to suggest, other than a standard inhaler, which makes this problem worse for me.  

Problem is: I have a muscle disease. One of the issue there is that too little oxygen ends up in my leg muscles and they don't work as good as they should. My body compensates by adjusting heart rate and breathing, but there's a maximum that seems possible. On longer runs, this might result in mild hyperventilation, and related loss of potassium and magnesium. Followed by a mild EIB flareup some 2 hours after the run. If I use an inhaler before running then my heartrate gets messed up and running is less smooth to start with. And I inhale more oxygen, but still don't get more oxygen into my leg muscles, and hence need to keep breathing rate up in order to run. So I totally hyperventilate. And totally lose Mg and K and get a big EIB flareup. Btw, Salbutamol can also cause reduction in both electrolytes. So taking it might make things worse in several aspects. Worst case I end up on prednisone, which basically sends my kidneys into overdrive, which doesn't really help. 

Basically: is there anything that works against a mild EIB but doesn't influence heartrate, doesn't increase oxygen uptake and is electrolyte sparing?"
"I‚Äôm a 24yr old gal and last week I came down what I thought was a chest infection (I‚Äôve had pneumonia 5/6 times since I was 12 so know the symptoms haha) so went to the doctor. Got given strong nebulizer dose and put on steroid tablets and antibiotics as well as my inhalers. 2 days later I‚Äôm in A&amp;E getting tests done and ended up getting 6 nebulizer treatments over about 2 hours - I got told my X-ray was clear and there didn‚Äôt seem to be any infection but that was it. 

It‚Äôs now almost a week later and I still have a persistent loud wheeze, dry cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. I‚Äôm not sure what to do and where to go from here as I was just told to finish my steroids and antibiotics (both finished) and continue taking my inhalers but I don‚Äôt seem to be getting better. 

Anyone have any advice? I‚Äôm not sure what to say to my doctors cause they just said to stick with the inhalers but I‚Äôve never had this happen before and am really worried ahah"


"Hello everyone! I hope everyone is healthy and happy! So my question is...I have been prescribed Symbicort for the past 3 years for asthma. Last fall a new pulmonologist I started seeing gave me a sample of Breztri to try because he thought it would work better for me and he was right. One inhalation in the morning and that was it! No need for even my rescue inhaler. After that one visit, the pulmonoligist retired and i still haven't found another one. So I DID get another general practitioner and he kept prescribing me Symbicort until I mentioned Breztri and explaining that it worked better. For insurance reasons he prescribed me Trelegy instead saying it is similar. My question is....how soon after taking the Symbicort can I switch over to Trelegy? I heard it could be fatal taking them together and that's why I am bringing it here to Reddit. Thank you in advance for any replies and I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend!"
"I‚Äôve been using a salbutamol inhaler and now a steroid inhaler after having recently had covid (I‚Äôm not asthmatic but figured you guys are probably the best to ask). 

I‚Äôd been using the salbutamol inhaler for a few weeks with no problem but my shortness of breath/chest tight got worse so I started a steroid inhaler. 

A day after starting it I felt nauseous, and just generally groggy. This hasn‚Äôt really gone in the last few days. I feel nauseous, my stomach feels a bit unsettled and I just feel rubbish. Is this a common side effect of the inhaler? I can‚Äôt see stomach upset etc on the info in the box. 

Thanks"

" So, today I've learned I have asthma, and doc prescribed me a steroid inhaler, which can cause hoarseness and long-term damage on vocal chords. I mean, I already went to the doctor to sing better. So I don't want to use it, and I am looking for another treatment which is like steroid inhalers. What can I take? Steroid Tablets?"
"Reuploaded for convenience  

Fiberglass has been coming out of my mattress for awhile but I didn't notice it until I took the cover off for a few days (puppy + muddy paws + being lazy). Only took a short nap on it twice without the cover because I have another bed.

I didn't spend lot if time inspecting that room, but fiberglass is all over my clothes and covering my pc monitor. As for the rest of the house, I've seen it on the furniture, curtains and places where dust settles. So far it's been easy to clean with a lint roller, and wet paper towels. We will wash the curtains and clothes at a laundromat.

I got an estimate that was $150 for hepa vacuuming and using a microfiber cloth for the bedroom. Also, using an air scrubber 2 days for $450.  

Would the air scrubber be effective since it seems to be settling? 

Any tips or suggestions?

Thank you for reading and have a great day!"

"The last 2 years, I have essentially been in total social isolation as someone living with chronic asthma &amp; previously supporting elderly family members through a family crisis. I also live in a 4 season climate where winters are particularly brutal with the pandemic.

All that being said: it's almost spring, and I am ready to start socializing in-person. Where I live, the haphazard indoor mask mandates are about to lapse, and it's really ""the wild West.""

I feel overwhelmed about how to organize social activities when nearly everyone I know is pretty much living their lives like the before times.

Curious if there are folks in this sub who are also still on the cautious side, and what you are doing socially now? How are you putting up your boundaries, and what are those conversations looking like?"
Does anyone notice any difference? I started using the turbohaler for 2-3 weeks and my coughing has worsened while I‚Äôve been on the rapid haler for months and it went away. I thought there wasn‚Äôt much difference since it‚Äôs just the mode of delivery.
"What helps you with chest tightness? Since I had Covid (like 3 weeks ago) I often have chest tightness, sitting up helps a bit, but it does not really go away. I also have no idea if it‚Äôs long Covid or rather from my asthma."
"Hey all. My kiddo has been having some asthma symptoms and we are out of albuterol. Not sure whats going on but the pharmacy didn't receive the rx and told me they sent a request this morning. Its almost noon and still haven't heard anything.

So far, we have done steamy showers, HEPA running all night, staying calm with slow breathing, lots of water, and of course continuing her maintenance inhaler. I've tried propping her up at night but she is usually flat by morning.

She is still wheezing a bit and coughing. Anything else I can do?"
"I've always had mild - mod asthma, currently my asthma is under control and my oxygen levels are fine but I'm finding myself very short of breath (will be taking covid test) - does anyone have experience with this/any suggestions?"
"I don‚Äôt know what this is‚Ä¶ every time I‚Äôm lying down (either at night or when I wake up in the morning or middle of night) I start getting extreme wheezing while breathing and whistling and shortness of breath. Like I can take deep breaths and FEEL it in my chest and hear the wheezing and whistling of such. 

But the weird thing is, during the daytime, I‚Äôm perfectly FINE. Also I only notice this recurring during the winter months. Since a kid this has been happening to me around this time of the year either when I try to sleep or when I wake up. 

I tried getting checked out by a doctor as a kid, but since I went during the daytime, they did MULTIPLE tests on me and said my breathing was completely perfect and told me to go home. This happened multiple times. So how would I show these symptoms to a doctor when I‚Äôm perfectly fine in the daytime and can only visit the doctor during the day?

Also any ideas what this could be? It only happens in the winter seasons, I get a good amount of sleep, I drink tons of water and I‚Äôm a very healthy and active person as I am an athlete. I don‚Äôt smoke.

I‚Äôm very concerned cause if someone were to hear my wheezing they would be seriously concerned for my breathing. Also switching sides does not help at all, not on stomach, side or back."
Are CT scans accurate in detecting Pneumonia?  What's the odds of one missing it?
"Just in these past two weeks, I‚Äôve gone on two different rounds of prednisone. I‚Äôm taking three allergy medications. Been using a rescue inhaler, a daily maintenance inhaler, and a nebulizer daily. I went to five different doctors appointments over the past week. Finally, this morning, I tried Dupixient at a medical appointment. The doctor said that I looked awful and couldnt walk in a straight line. This sentiment was repeated a couple of times during the day. Hours later, at work, I almost fainted and none of the normal treatments made a dent. EMS was activated for me at the office. 

My asthma manifests as VIOLENT coughing - coughing which makes me vomit, which makes me fall to the floor etc. It‚Äôs been getting worse and worse for months, and its now at the point where pretty much any movement or scent or ANYTHING is a trigger. 

Doctors don‚Äôt know whats wrong with me. When I‚Äôm not having an intermittent attack, I appear fine. My vitals are normal. All of the typical asthma tests come up normal. As soon as a doctor hears an attack, they immediately do a double take. 

Im scared Im just going to be discharged. After months of violent coughing &amp; all these treatments, plus multiple cough suppressants, my coughs are getting weak. They maybe even sound normal. This is not normal. I am just extremely worn down. 

Before I got this sick, I was an athlete. Today, getting out of bed is enough to trigger a coughing fit. 

Thanks for letting me vent. Sorry for any grammatical or spelling errors, its been a long day and im up way past my bedtime bc I still cannot stop coughing. Even while laying in a hosptial bed :( 

Anybody have GOOD experiences in hospitals which they care to share?"
"Just wanted to go on a rant and I know most of you will hopefully understand.

I‚Äôve had asthma since childhood. It‚Äôs been mild for most of my adult life until I lived with a cat for 2.5 years.

I knew I was allergic but didn‚Äôt know the extent. My asthma was mostly fine for at least a year then it started getting worse. 

I fell in love with the cat and did everything I could to reduce dander. I finally got allergy tested and yes very allergic to cats.

I‚Äôve had to increase medication and I‚Äôve been really struggling pretty bad for the past 6 months.

I tried to get approved for Nucala and they didn‚Äôt approve. I‚Äôve had two pulmonary function tests, both of which came back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. 

We made the heartbreaking decision to rehome our cat but to a friend so we can still visit. That‚Äôs emotionally affecting me on a daily basis.

I‚Äôve started deep cleaning the house and know it takes a while for cat dander to go away but I‚Äôm just feeling hopeless and alone.

I‚Äôm so tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own home for fear of my asthma getting triggered. Its taking a toll on my mental health and relationships.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for here. Maybe just some encouragement or to commiserate. Just needed to vent."
"hey guys!

always had asthma but until a couple years ago i always thought my breathing issues were because i used to be overweight. i notice my breathing issues fairly regularly throughout the day for example when I run to catch a train or go up the stairs quickly. 

when i‚Äôm drunk i‚Äôve raced my friends for fun but i don‚Äôt remember ever being out of breath then. i feel like that‚Äôs weird. is it the alcohol? what has your experience with alcohol has been with regards to asthma?"
"I've had cough variant asthma for many years, officially diagnosed about 3 years ago. Also sarcoidosis in my lungs, which causes coughing as well. I've tried several inhalers, but none have really helped at all. I've had Albuterol on hand for years. I try not to use it, unless I get a really bad coughing spell. But it makes such a difference! Of course, I do know it's a rescue inhaler, and should not be used daily. (Even if the package directions call for one puff every four hours as needed. And the prescription is written for 3 inhalers for 90 days. 200 puffs per inhaler. I've never more than half used one inhaler in 12 months, and half the sprays are to prime it since it hasn't been used.) Since none of the previous maintenance inhalers have worked, I give up on them. How can I tell if one just doesn't work for me, or if I just need a higher dose of it?"
"So this all started literally at the beginning of February. Almost every night I‚Äôve had really bad shortness of breath to the point where I can‚Äôt sleep, and I‚Äôve been to the emergency room 3 times already this month. Each chest x-ray was normal, all the blood work was normal and they give me albuterol mixed with something else, IV drips, and a steroid injection and they send me home with prednisone, one time they even prescribed me antibiotics but I wasn‚Äôt told about any infections. 

Nothing has changed. I‚Äôve lived my life the same way I have since forever. The only think I can trace back to is literally right after our tub was re-finished (strong chemicals were used) and we came back into the house after the recommended 4 hours to ventilate the apartment is when all of this started. But that was so long ago. The chemical fumes, as far as I know, are long gone and yet I am still suffering. We even invested in a second large air purifier and we dusted and vacuumed and everything. . I‚Äôm even taking antihistamines daily. 

At home, I try to treat my asthma with albuterol sulfate via my nebulizer and my albuterol rescue inhaler, but it only works for 2 hours and I‚Äôm back at it again. I‚Äôm taking my albuterol way more than I should and I‚Äôve read everywhere that if you‚Äôre using it more than twice a month and that frequently, something is wrong. 

But I keep being told nothing is wrong. 
The only thing that keeps my asthma attacks at bay are the prednisone but as soon as I‚Äôm done with the rounds, my attacks come right back. I‚Äôm back on another 5 day round of prednisone and I‚Äôm horrified of them running out because I feel like my asthma attacks are just going to return again. . 

I‚Äôm constantly feeling impending doom. I feel like this is never going to stop. I‚Äôm going to go see my primary care doctor next week and the ER says to ask if I can be referred to an allergist/pulmonologist. 

But I feel like it‚Äôs useless? My blood work and chest x-rays are normal so I don‚Äôt know what else they could possibly rule out. . 

Anyone experience something similar? Will it stop? What was happening with you and what finally relieved it? I just got promoted at work to supervisor and everything and my asthma has been so bad I‚Äôve had to skip out of work various times and I‚Äôve just been crying at home helplessly and praying to God for an answer and for relief. ."
"Hello all, new here.  Forgive my ignorance. Since I was about 12 years old, after an accident at a water park that ended up with me inhaling a bit of pool water, every time I have a good laugh, I have an uncontrolled coughing fit. Like a smokers cough, feeling like I'm about to hack up a piece of lung, chest pain etc...

I went to the doctor over two decades ago, and ""exercise induced asthma"" was the label they presented my parents with. I don't have any trouble breathing or any obvious asthma symptoms, except when I laugh too hard. I don't use an inhaler or anything like that. In fact, I don't even think about it until I have a coughing fit



Can anyone here relate? Am I just crazy? Misdiagnosed? Looking for opinions or similar anecdotes."
"I‚Äôve dealt with asthma and awful allergies my whole life. I‚Äôve been hospitalized numerous times from anaphylactic reactions to food and medication, I‚Äôve had 3 EEG‚Äôs done with esophageal dilation. 


Only until about 2 months ago did a gastro finally tell me my swelling in my throat may be caused by allergies. I was prescribed prednisone for 7 days, Claritin, and 10mg singulair. 

I‚Äôm scared shitless to take singulair, I have talked to 5-10 people who take it and not one has had any negative side effects but say it changes their lives for the better.

My question is; in the off chance I DO have mental side effects will I know it before I completely lose my mind? I don‚Äôt want to wake up and go crazy on my wife or jump off my house or something. 

Thank you for any input, lots of good information on this board!"
"I've had numerous negative PCR test, but I know they're false negatives. I've even having bad breathing problems and lyrngitis for 3 weeks now. All I've been doing is crying all day. I know I'm not going to make it. I can't take this anymore. I don't know what to do. I should just go ahead and do something drastic right now to get it over with. This is the worst thing I've ever went though in my life."
"Drs aren't sure exactly what I have, but I do have lung disease, and I'm about done. I can't take this anymore. Nothing helps, nothing relieves it. I haven't slept in days because my breathing is so bad. I've been to the ER countless times and they don't even try to help. 
I'm scared to death that it's covid because I was exposed, but after numerous scans and PCR test they tell me it's not Covid. I literally can't hang on. I've lost all hope. All I've been doing all morning is crying begging for something or some one to help.

I feel like I'm the only one thats ever went through anything like this before and no one can help me. I've never felt so alone and helpess in my life."
So i just started a consistent workout program about 3-4 times a week a mix of strength training and hiit workouts. But I have notice that my asthma and me using my inhaler has gotten worse! Anyone go through something similar? I figured exercise would help my lungs?
"hey all have any of you had your asthma just completely disappear?
mine got bad when i moved to a moldy, dusty old house in a wet climate with tons of pine trees. i went on advair, singulair, xyzal and it improved some.
it got worse when i moved to a dry desert area, working in an extemely dusty environment. i also got very sick this time (likely early covid) and switched my inhaler to trelegy with success. i also started working from home in my spotless dust free apartment and running daily not long after this which also helped improve symptoms.
fast forward to today where ive stopped trelegy (still on antihistamine) with doctor supervision two weeks ago and feel completely fine.

tl;dr- allergies and asthma got better dont need meds - did i become desensitized to my enviornment?"
"So I'm about to turn 30 and I've had asthma as long as I can remember. Growing up through school and even college years it was always just sports induced level. I knew my triggers (severe cold, cat allergies, and exercise) and everything was good. Fast forward to about a years ago, I now am far less active then my younger days with an office job and not really working out anymore. I start having issues with waking up shortness of breath and wheezing in my slee, im also having issues witb my asthma acting up durring the day and needing my rescue inhaler about 2 to 3 times a week. I talk to my doctor and she gets me on a qvar redihaler preventative prescription as well as a sleep study to check for sleep apnea. Sure enough I have sleep apnea (not a real surprise as just about everyone else in my family has it already.) So I also get a cpap machine and the qvar, and soon enough everything gets better. Well few months go by and I unfortunately lose my job and health insurance. Since the qvar is about two to three hundred dollars depending on discount cards and where I get it from I can't afford that so I stop taking it. First month no real change cpap keeps me asleep at night and I don't really think about it. Well then after that it all goes downhill. My asthma has since been getting worse and worse. Im sadly at a point where I take my albuterol inhaler almost daily now and it's obviously worrysum. I know I  need to get back to a doctor and get this checked out but I'm curious if my lungs somehow became dependent on the qvar and now they are worse off then when I started. Or maybee it's just my physical health? I admittedly have gained about 30 to 40 pounds over the last year so I'm sure that hasn't helped. 

Any thoughts or advice is appreciated in advance."
I have a whole bunch of unopened vials that expired in 2016. I know that the effectiveness degrades over the years but I just feel so wasteful throwing all of it away. Anyway to donate it or give it to someone who could use it?
"I have severe ashtma and I notice when it gets bad sometimes my throat feels really tight. That's the only symptom when it happens, it just feels like my throat is closing but then after a bit it goes away (it can last anywhere from 20 mins to well over an hour). This sometimes happens multiple times a day. I've noticed this for the last 2 years and I can go like 6 months without it happening and then it will just start up again. Is it because symbicort? I've been on that for a little over a month. Maybe it's anxiety? I'm tired of my throat randomly feeling like it's closing so much lately. Anyone else experience this?"
"Hi everybody since june 2020 i started to have breathing problems, at first it was all alergy symptoms but than i had a cough that doesn't go away nor stop. I have been using Levocetirizine pill since then. But recently i had very bad coughes that made me think what if i suffocate and need to go to emergency room. This was on top of a tight chest and breathing difficulties i can't bear certain scents and all that. Today for the first time i see a pulmonologist and she told me i had asthma and that i should keep using my pill but also started an inhaler (Budesonide). My question is should i use this inhaler ? Obviously a professional prescribed it to me but I am afraid it would make me dependent on a medicine or that it would wear out my respiratory system. Has anyone here ever regret that they started an inhaler ? Plus I was told to was my mouth after using it or else i would get scars in my mouth. I am also concerned w√¨th this. 
I wish everybody a healthy life filled with full strength breath."
"As the title says. I am a mid-20s male trying to lose some weight, and 5-7 days ago I went for a run in the cold, but turned back early. I had to use my inhaler for the first time in ages, and every night since then my lungs get bad again and I have to use my inhaler before taking my daily dose of Advair, which I take once a day, at night. That Advair has been enough to manage my asthma for ages, but all of a sudden I need to use my inhaler every night, which worries me. Did I do real damage? Will this go away? Anyone with advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated."
"I've had to answer these for the doctor twice, and they are also listed online for severity level categorizations. 

The questions are things like ""how often do you have symptoms,"" ""how often do you have night time symptoms,"" ""how much does your asthma interfere with your daily activities?""

The thing is, I don't really know what they are referring to. What level of symptoms are they asking about? Anything including very slight/minor symptoms? 

Does nighttime refer only to while sleeping or does it include the evening too? I often feel worse in the evenings, and I often wake up in the mornings breathing rapidly, shallowly, or having to catch my breath but I really have no idea if I have symptoms in the middle of the night. Even when I wake up in the middle of the night feeling uncomfortable, I don't feel awake enough to know exactly what I'm feeling.

And what counts as interfering with daily activities? I often have to ""manually breathe"" or feel uncomfortable while working a desk job, and while it's distracting, I don't have to stop working. At home I sometimes have to move more slowly so I don't get out of breath, or I sometimes avoid getting up to get something or do a chore if my breathing isn't super great (only recently made the connection to asthma since I didn't even notice I do these).

Please help me understand haha"
"I've read online that drinking water after using an inhaler can cause side effects, but I can't find exactly *what* side effects that causes. I did swallow my saliva after using my inhaler last night because I was in bed and didn't want to get up to spit it out, and I immediately noticed my heart racing and had to calm myself down. Is this related?"
"I never had asthma until 2011 when I was at Coachella. It was over 100 degrees and on a dusty polo field. Used a friend‚Äôs albuterol and seemed to help. 

Since then I get mild asthma symptoms when I‚Äôm stressed (I believe that‚Äôs the trigger). 

I‚Äôm wondering if albuterol should help with the symptoms caused by stress."
I‚Äôm curious to see if this is common. I wheeze sometimes when exhaling or inhaling but it‚Äôs more of a slight whistle and can only really be heard by me. My throat just gets really tight around triggers and my lungs start to hurt and feel tight.
"Just saw the allergist today and had allergy testing done. He also specializes in asthma. We talked about my asthma symptoms and the meds I was taking. He wants to switch me from Flovent to Pulmicort. I asked him what is the reason behind the switch. He said it's a safe inhale and it's what he prescribes to pregnant women. I am a male so can't relate to his reasoning. Anyway, anyone on or had tried Pulmicort? Side effects/success stories?"
"I‚Äôve always had asthma but it has increased dramatically in severity since I got covid back in September 2021. Now it‚Äôs the first tree season (which is always my worst allergen even tho I have severe allergies to grass and other pollens as well), and I‚Äôm having some worse symptoms. I‚Äôm having the sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes as usual. But this season I‚Äôm also having chest pain, tightness, hoarse voice, and a ton of mucus that feels like it‚Äôs deeper down than just my throat. It doesn‚Äôt feel like other viruses I‚Äôve had and it‚Äôs only gotten this bad when the pollen count has gone up. Is this just my asthma being aggravated or should I be afraid that I have COVID again??"
Anyone else having a rough time this winter? For the past few years my asthma has been fairly well controlled. I've usually gotten one chest infection a year and it would last about one week. Not too bad overall. But I've now had FIVE infections since the end of October (Covid included in that)! I'm so sick of coughing up junk. I've just gotten one virus after another. Anyone else struggling this winter?


"this post is going to be mean as hell but I just had a really scary attack and don‚Äôt care anymore lol. anyways please just go buy a vape if you want to smoke outside of designated areas. if you smoke where it‚Äôs physically impossible to avoid your cancer smoke, you are a bad person. Sorry not sorry.

I‚Äôm a skier and I‚Äôve had FOUR! asthma attacks on the chairlift or at the top of a mountain because people will not stop smoking on it. Fun fact! That shit moves and is blowing your smoke directly into my face for 15 minutes while I am in the air and unable to leave! 

Words cannot describe the degree of hatred I have towards these people. I‚Äôm so fucking tired of having a fun day out ruined because people just can‚Äôt wait a few extra minutes to ruin their lungs."
Does anyone here smoke weed and have asthma and how has it affected you if it has at all? Just looking for an answer to my anxiety that isn‚Äôt a pill
"Can you please post links to purchase the one you use?  Looking for relatively inexpensive, but does the job well, that comes with all accessories needed.  Must ship to Canada.  Quick shipping needed.  Looking to nebulize saline to bring up phlegm. Thank you!"
"Could someone possibly help me to get some insight on why adderall/methylphenidate seem to completely take my asthma symptoms away and my inhalers only seem to work very short term. I‚Äôve been on wixela and a rescue inhaler for about a year and recently began adhd treatment. I noticed that not only does it help me mentally function but it also seem to help my body do what it‚Äôs supposed to be doing. I had a few injuries from being in the service, those haven‚Äôt completely gone away but the management of the pain is increasingly easier and requires less meds. My asthma is basically non existent now and I feel like I‚Äôm actually living again and not just trying to survive. What kind of interaction is this having that makes me seem more whole as a human and healthier? Any questions I will answer the best I can. Adderall is 20mg IR. 10mg with breakfast and 10mg with lunch."

Also, any recommendations on a fairly inexpensive, effective, nebulizer that I could purchase that does a good job?

"Started smoking a year ago,from then to now there was no shortness of breath,it started a couple months ago when i first encountered Shortness of breath and a tiny chest pain and i had excesive coughing,now when i wake up i cant Even breathe a half of my lungs,the chest pain is intense and i have to exercise small breaths to be able to do a full lung inhale,what should i do?should i be worried?"
"I have a 2.5 yo child with respiratory issues. It's a combination of asthma and other \[TBD\] which have resulted in multiple hospitalizations. One of the indicators of respiratory crisis is dropping o2 levels, which I would like to be able to monitor 24/7. I had him trying on Samsung Active 4 Watches over the weekend, SIM enabled with an Spo2 sensor, but we couldn't get it to provide consistent readings. The watch face was too large (even the 40mm) and the monitor would instruct us to ""keep an elbow on a table"" or ""position your hand near your heart"", all quite challenging for a toddler and the amount of bad readings would totally negate the usefulness 

Is there a good wearable that someone could recommend for the situation? Simple, compact, with constant data connectivity and a decent o2 sensor? Even better if it has GPS and I can monitor his location."
"Can anyone here with asthma help me out here? 

I‚Äôm finally home from the hospital after 3 days. They sent me home with a daily steroid inhaler, a rescue inhaler, and steroids to wean off of. 

I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with asthma before now though looking back I guess I had warning signs that just never got picked up on. 

So anyway, I‚Äôm still short of breath, still a little wheezy, and coughing a lot but I don‚Äôt know if the rescue inhaler is for a full on emergency , like hyperventilating or if it should be used when I have shortness of breath. 

I‚Äôm not hyperventilating but I do feel very short of breath but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs because I was getting round the clock breathing treatments and steroid shots and now that it‚Äôs stopped my body needs to find equilibrium or something. 

Ugggh this is so frustrating. I don‚Äôt want to accidentally use it too much and make myself sick or something."
"Hi all,

Out of pure curiosity I‚Äôm wondering about this mysterious symptom of asthma, if it has a name and if anybody else has experienced this, since I‚Äôm unable to Google it.

For reference I‚Äôve had asthma for years, I manage it with an inhaler and generally don‚Äôt think about it. However today I did some exercise and didn‚Äôt have my inhaler on me so I am currently experiencing a mild asthma attack.

As always happens during an asthma attack, when I breathe in, even after I tell my muscles to stop inhaling, the breath continues for a moment without my control. After I am done taking the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù breath, there seems to be a second, quieter breath that happens without prompting from my breathing muscles. This extra breath lasts up to about a second. The only way to stop it is to close my mouth or perform a glottal stop. The sound is quieter, higher pitched, and more hissing, and it seems to be coming from air hitting the back of the throat rather than rushing into the lungs. I can feel the air hitting the back of my throat.

Is there a term for this? I‚Äôm curious about what‚Äôs actually going on. Thanks!"
"Question:  
Is it possible to go from completely asymptomatic (and with no prior history of breathing/allergy issues) to struggling to breathe due to asthma in &lt; 2 weeks?

I'm new to asthma and am definitely no asthma expert. I feel like asthma is the kind of thing that comes on gradually rather than a sudden acute problem. But i don't know and Google hasn't been very helpful in answering my question.

History:  
\- Was diagnosed with asthma \~6 months ago by GP.  
\- Diagnosis was based solely on peak flow and listing to my breathing. Have not seen a specialist. Have not had any lung scans done.  
\- Peak flow is approx. 70% of normal.  
\- Went from completely asymptomatic to struggling to breath while exercising over &lt;2 weeks. I know it was &lt;2 weeks because i did a race a race and felt fine, then 2 weeks later went to run another race and was doubled-over struggling to breath partway through and had to stop.  
\- Symptoms have not changed ever since.  
\- Only symptoms are hoarse breathing when exercising with wheezing at high intensities. No other symptoms (cough, etc.).  
\- Various inhalers have helped, but at best have only reduced symptoms by 50%.  
\- Allergy medicine hasn't made any difference (don't have a history of allergies).  
\- I had considered long covid from an asymptomatic infection, but my country had basically zero covid cases at the time of symptom onset, and i had two negative test shortly after symptom onset, so this seems unlikely.

Should i be questioning my GP's diagnosis? Are there specific asthma tests they should be doing?

Any help/guidance would be appreciated."
"Hi, at first, just want to say thank to everyone. This group has been so helpful to me, and make me feel I am not alone to deal with chronic health problem.

My asthma was never be a problem or concern to me until late Nov 2021 and recently got worse since I caught covid in Jan 2022.Recently, I came across the term of ‚Äúusing nebulizer with saline solution to treat asthma, help you breath better, help the salt to go to your lung to help clean mucus which helps you breath better‚Äù. I did some researches but still not sure if it works. This is some of my conditions and hope I have a cleaner picture. 

- i am 27, lives in GTA and Winter with snow always my nightmares. I got flareups, chest tightness when I am outdoor.
- i am currently using Symbicort 3 times x 2 puffs a day + singular 10mg at night time ( i used Symbicort 2 times x 2 puffs before but it did not help to control my asthma). I still have chest tightness throughout day, night times coughing, use rescue puffer 2-3 times a day when I start having coughs and cannot breath. 
- built up mucus back of my throat

So I am desperately try to feel better. So I am asking for you guys opinion. 

Thank you"
"I am 18 years old, Male, and I‚Äôve been vaping for around 5 years. ( I quit a couple months ago). One morning I woke up with shortness of breathe, feeling like I can‚Äôt take a full breathe or even yawn. I am a mouth breather but I also had symptoms after this encounter. This has been going on for months and I still feel like my breathing is getting worse. I went to the hospital a month ago and they said my chest X-ray came back fine, EKG said my heart was fine, a blood test said I don‚Äôt have diabetes and my blood pressure was normal, and my oxygen levels came back fine along with that they used a stethoscope to listen to my breathing. Further investigation led to GERD as they found a hiatal narrowing and a loose esophageal sphincter. I still feel like I can not breathe as I once did, I suspect Asthma or COPD but I am going to request a CT scan or a spirometry test. This has been ongoing for months and I have a fast beating heart, shortness of breathe, and occasional chest pain. Thoughts?"
"I have been in the hospital for 6 days and getting Combivent (from nebulizer) on average 4-5 times per day. I feel good and can breathe after I take it, but if the time between two doses becomes longer than usual I feel difficult to breathe with louder wheezing sounds by hours and having anxiety on top of that because I feel like I'm getting dependent on Combivent with no improvement. 

Please share your experience for some hope. Has anyone had hospital treatment for asthma lasting longer than 6 days and how long till you did eventually get off the quick-acting nebulizer? I want to get home soon and that means I will need to continue to use the quick acting solution at home for a while as well.

I am also getting three dose of Pulmicort from nebulizer per day for the past 6 days and even though it is supposed to prevent the attacks, I have not seen my attacks substantially reduced yet. Does it take you folks a long time to see the controlling effects of pulmicort as well?"
"So this is hilariously stupid but my inhaler (Flovent) fell out of my medicine cabinet and STRAIGHT into my toilet.  I have not been using the inhaler since as I can't imagine that using a germ-covered inhaler can be safe for my lungs.  I tried to refill my prescription but my insurance company denied the renewal since it was ""too soon"" to refill it.  I have exercise-induced asthma, so it's not a life or death situation if I don't have the inhaler, so I'm not trying to pay $300+ out of pocket for the inhaler in the meantime.  Does anyone have any recommendations on how to clean the inhaler or disinfect it appropriately?  My current theory is that boiling the plastic inhaler cover would be my best bet but I'm not sure if I can just remove the canister without damaging the device.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"
"Hi,

Years ago, I almost died while working at Pinterest because there were dogs everywhere in the office. They left me in severe pain, low energy, and seeking medical attention till this day. Everyday ended up being a struggle to breathe. People like myself have asthma triggered by being indoors with dogs. Many people don‚Äôt understand allergens (i.e. dead skin/dander) can fill an indoor space like odor or viruses. It‚Äôs been painful and at times life threatening. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore now that pets are common at workplaces, ride-shares, restaurants, planes, and hotels. I‚Äôm always worried about my safety and if this will lead to my death. Under the American Disability Act, I tried contacting workplaces, restaurants, and airports but it often leads to being ignored or nothing significant. Many places historically did not allow pets but now they are allowed and an entire group of people are excluded or harmed. I could really use your help on sharing this information and getting any ideas on building some awareness for people like us to feel safe again?

I often find myself crying my way to sleep. My body hurts. Life outside is hard. I don't know what to do anymore as this gets worst.

**My Story**

Like an odor can fill up a floor, dogs can spread their allergens throughout an entire space. I would breathe it in and have an asthma attack. Asthma can be life threatening, counts as a disability when occurring, and is protected by the American Disability Act, but I‚Äôm finding fewer and fewer companies caring about people with pet allergies.

Without knowing there were dogs, I started working at Pinterest. On my first day, I had an asthma attack. I alerted my manager, HR, and then ultimately the CEO. I met others who were struggling with severe symptoms. With several Pinterest offices in the area, I asked if they could make our building with the dog free floor completely dog free given many of the allergic employees were in the same building in order to do their jobs with their teams. I also told them that there were daily sightings of dogs on an assigned dog free floor and even if there weren‚Äôt, the floor itself does not work because there‚Äôs a giant staircase through each floor spreading air with allergens in it. They didn‚Äôt budge.

We had to tolerate symptoms and were sick for weeks at a time. I medicated with the support of a doctor and had severe asthma attacks throughout the experience.

My manager and HR said I can work from home but there was constant pressure from my manager to get me to show up in person at the office.The environment included people asking to fire me and making jokes about people with dog allergies on Slack. I was also afraid of being found out when people ask me why I'm calling into meetings. My management chain kept suggesting it would be good for me to be in the office.

Over many months, the company often said they care about my safety and verbally committed to items in regards to the dog allergens at work and my health but often failed to deliver on them, such as: air filters, adjusting work conditions, workload adjustments, lobby policies, responding to emails promptly. They experimented with signs that said no dogs on the dog free floor that employees continued to ignore. When someone posted on Blind about the health issue with allergies and asthma, employees commented saying people like me should not work here or be fired. All this time, I was heavily medicated and had a massive amount of chest pains and difficulty breathing everyday. My health was getting worse.

I tried finding another company but I was not in any shape to do well in an interview. I kept getting allergy shots in hopes they helped but they‚Äôre not a cure. Work was very demanding. When I looked at other companies (i.e. Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, Asana, Workday, startups), many of them already had a dog friendly policy. Recruiters would not follow up when I told them that I‚Äôm allergic to dogs. It‚Äôs very hard to find opportunities to work in a safe work environment.

I was explicitly begging for my life and saying I‚Äôm afraid of dying to my manager and HR. Finally, a senior leader who has been trying to help because his team had someone who was also getting very sick told me that they‚Äôre removing the dog policy because there were many cases of dogs in the dining area where the health department brought it up as an issue. It just really made me feel like my life was so expendable. Free food beat out dogs at work, but nearly killing us did not.

Due to the many months of exposure, I continued to have health issues after the dogs were removed. I barely slept, as I‚Äôd have severe daily chest pains at night. I‚Äôve been working with doctors ever since to try to relieve my pain and to breathe normally again. I‚Äôve lost years of my life to this now due to the incident and the symptoms that have followed me since. I‚Äôve spent so much time laying in bed wishing for the pain to stop and questioning if it would have been better if the incident had just succeeded in taking my life.

I brought up my manager‚Äôs behavior with the company where he was not following up on reasonable accommodation items that he said he would. He even said I would \[f-word\] this new task up while referring to how my asthma made his life harder. The company performed an investigation on this where he got feedback then promoted a month later. It did not matter if I continued to have asthma attacks. As long as the company was trying something like talking about doing something, they were accommodating. It‚Äôs been rough from so many angles.

At the end of the day, people love dogs. I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I see dogs in restaurants, bars, planes, workplaces, and hotels now. I feel people like me are doomed to not have less access to many places in the future. I‚Äôm still overwhelmed from seeing physicians in hopes of being able to breathe, sleep, and feel safe again one day. I see others are struggling with this too, but I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel so weak and low on energy from my experience at Pinterest.

Also people often focused the conversation to service dogs but the vast majority of allergens at work were from pet dogs, not service dogs. I believe people who are allergic to dogs and those in need of a service dog can figure out a way to not impact each other. I‚Äôve also heard many service dog owners prefer their dog to not be around non-trained dogs due to how they might react.

"Has anyone here been prescribed a Trimbow 3-1 inhaler for asthma, I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs used more for copd but I‚Äôve only got asthma , does anyone know I‚Äôd it‚Äôs safe and effective"
"I started working in a sales call centre over a month ago. I‚Äôm on the phone talking and pitching to customers for 8 hours a day and after about two weeks I‚Äôve noticed my breathing getting worse as well as my throat feels swollen.

I have been introverted for most of my life and wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone to develop my communication skills. I honestly have never spoken more in one day then I have at this job. After a day of work my breath is shallow and my throat feels swollen.  A few days ago on my day off I could barely breath and it was giving me anxiety over things I don‚Äôt usually get anxious about. And talking to my partner became really difficult due to the lack of oxygen. I had to stop talking most of the Day and communicate on paper or text because I felt like I couldn‚Äôt expend anymore energy on talking and I was worried if I didn‚Äôt rest I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do my job the next day.

Just as a reference I exercise 3 times a week and cycle to work. And in December I had asthma issues and had to increase my inhaler dose but overal before the job my breathing felt normal


So my question, asthmatic reddits, is does anyone else experience this? And does anyone know how much talking can affect asthmatics?"
"I had covid one year ago and then some lingering lung issue afterward. Fast forward to today, I still have a lung issue and have even seen a pulmonologist for it. Was diagnosed with mild persistent asthma. I haven‚Äôt taken any prescribed medicine yet for it (medicine anxiety) but have had a full feeling in my chest and plenty of phlegm. I had cat allergies in the past that could cause chest tightness and some phlegm, but it would go away once I was away from the trigger. Now, it seems that this tightness and phlegm are happening without an obvious trigger. I have breo and a rescue inhaler (albuterol) but am afraid to take either of them without being near medical help."

3 year old we are almost positive has asthma but the DRs say it is too early to say for sure. Main symptom seems to be too much mucus and ends up throwing it up - usually at night. Anyone else experience this or have tips?
"My son has fairly bad asthma and he is 3. We typically know ALL the signs but last night something happened and I‚Äôm wondering whether it‚Äôs asthma? Side note, I think it is. He started with a runny nose and then about 15 min later, a gagging cough. He said he feels like spiders are tickling his throat and he doesn‚Äôt even cough it‚Äôs like he will just dry heave? Is this Asthma?"
"it has been very hard to breathe, but my inhaler is empty &amp; cannot be refilled for the next two days. i have a nebulizer, but is there anything else or possibly some breathing techniques that helped others?"
"Hi there! I'm Jude, and I'm making a video game called Compression. It's a survival horror game, and I'm not ready to share any more about it than that just yet. However, I wanted to ask something of the r/asthma community. There's been a running bit of bargain-bin criticism of games for years where people say 'wow, this character can't run/sprint for very long, must have asthma', or something along those lines. Honestly, I'm tired of hearing this complaint, and I think it'd be a cool bit of subversion and representation to say actually, yeah, my protagonist does have asthma. She has an asthma pump which she can use to prevent herself having an attack after having to run from monsters, and certain areas of the map cause it to flare up more due to heavy dust / particles in the air. My real question is, how do people with the condition feel about this? Is it insensitive? Asthma runs in my family, and it was suspected I had it as a child, but it seems I do not. As such, if I were going to do something like this, I'd like to hear from some people who have the condition to make sure I'm not mis-representing it, or acting insensitively! 

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

\- Jude"
So yesterday I realized I probably have asthma (not diagnosed yet but nurse says that seems like what it is) and I decided to check out this subreddit but everything here is kinda scary and I'd like some allies.
"My brother caught COVID last month and I was really afraid of getting sick.

I got an air purifier to remove virus from the air.

After running it constantly for a while, my asthma symptoms have been massively reduced!

I'll probably keep an air purifier around for the rest of my life. That's how big the difference has been for me."
Has anyone tried this method to treat asthma or know anyone that uses this method? I‚Äôm desperate lately and I‚Äôll just about try anything.
"Thanks in advance. Man, asthma sucks."
"So i have been taking Salbutamol inhalation 100mcg/dose inhaler shots around 5-6 times a day sometimes more from the last 9 years almost.

What side effects I should be looking upto anything I can do to reverse those side effects?

Any tips or advise from regular users, please share I amm feeling worried nowadays if it results in lung cancer or anything..."
I have a prescription I just picked up for Wixela for my asthma because it's gotten to the point where I'm using the albuterol inhaler most days. I'd rather just use a nebulizer with the albuterol solution because it's more effective for me than the inhaler. I'm nervous to do a steroid inhaler because I've heard lots of bad things about steroids causing long term problems and also there's the issue of moon face. Is that something that happens on these types of inhalers?
Has anyone taken Sudafed for sinus issues and it didn‚Äôt affect their asthma? Just want to be sure before I take it. Thank you for your help.
"At the beginning of my 4 year quest to determine source of chronic cough (ENT 2 surgeries, allergy testing, infectious disease, CT, Xray, pulmonologist) and treat it (untold variety of strong antibiotics, steroids swallowed, inhaled) I was prescribed albuterol inhaler of course.

Over several months, not knowing why, my lips kept swelling and itching and I was getting large welts behind my ears but it was sporadic. Saw doc took pictures.

Took deep pull on inhaler and throat started closing up which drove me to Dr. Google which may have saved my life. Classic severe allergic reaction to albuterol.

SOOOOOOOO

because this is a control for pulmonology testing which was inconclusive without it, I did self diagnosis of silent GERD induced asthma. I'm on multiple antacids prescription and OTC with no relief.

Part of my symptoms are steror/stridor/rhonci.

It started 2 years ago as sounding like a creepy girl whining in my ear (you could hear it on recording) then stopped for a year and now is a rumbling in my throat on exhale once I am even remotely reclined.

I cannot sleep without enough meds to completely knock me out so I am hungover either way.

And still the cough.

I almost wondered if the coughing has damaged my larynx. It was so bad I was I. diapers and tore my urethra from the stress incontinence. My job is 50% talk and though cough isn't at its worst I do have to mute calls several times in 5 minutes.

Does anyone out there have anything similar (the cough with noise) and how was it treated?

Next up is endoscopy.

Has anyone one here developed asthma from covid? My only symptoms were shortness of breath and a mild cough. Fast forward a couple months later I‚Äôm using symbicort daily and ventolin for attacks. If I knew the long term effects of covid I would have avoided that bitch like the plague.
"In a previous post I mentioned I've been having issues for months now and was hoping the doctor adding Symbicort would stop the cycle of better/worse.

Yesterday was the first day I didn't take a nebulizer before my Symbicort. Around 4am I woke up needing my rescue inhaler. I took it a couple of times. Went back to sleep until 9. Was still wheezing a little, so I took a nebulizer and then my Symbicort, and Mucinex.

I guess I need to find the right combination. I'll go back to doing the nebulizer first for a day or two and maybe try to take the albuterol inhaler first and see how that goes."
"Last night my mom suffocated and she said ""it's hard to breathe"" While laying in my dad's shoulder, What should I do when it happens again and how to treat it??"
"I have been having some mysterious illness (not Covid - tested many times) since the beginning of this year.  I have been to numerous -ologists and finally the pulmonologist (I do have an asthma dx) prescribed me something - 40mg prednisone for 5 days.  I have completed the course and feel generally a little bit better/hardier (my main problem right now are SoB and chest pains).  However, the prednisone seemed to have a paradoxical effect while taking it and I don‚Äôt understand why.  Night 3 I couldn‚Äôt stop peeing.  Then on days 4 and 5, I was coughing nonstop through the morning, and I did sound ‚Äúcongested‚Äù when coughing, but all that came out was frothy clear sputum.  By afternoon, when I finished the coughing session, my SoB would improve and I could go for short walks without stopping for the first time since I got sick.  It seemed my airways were extra sensitive with the prednisone (or maybe from all the coughing) - even walking near a highway sent me into a coughing fit.  Has anyone else had this reaction to prednisone?  What was your final diagnosis?  I am also being checked out for a potential cardiac cause of my woes as well, to note."
"Hello! So I had asthma as a child that I was under the impression I ""outgrew"" I know I used a nebulizer at one point and a variety of other things but my memory is hazy. Since this past November I've been having a lot of issues with asthma. It's gotten progressively worse. I've now been on three rounds of prednisone. Each time I'm better for a few weeks and once it leaves my system I am in terrible shape again. I have had a PFT and multiple tests done. I have been the the doctor many times. They thought I was okay because of the Prednisone and now I'm not again. She wrote me a script for Flovent to try instead of albuterol so I'm hoping that helps. I get shortness of breath and wheezing constantly using my albuterol inhaler many times a day. I just am hoping that this helps. However, did anyone have trouble figuring out a good treatment and how did you navigate that?"
"I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with asthma but it does run in my family.  Whenever the following things happen, I‚Äôve been having shortness of breath for a few minutes:

1. Walking outside when it‚Äôs really hot/cold

2.  Lifting heavy things like a box or even my backpack

3. Taking a hot shower, except after I shower I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe for like 30 minutes

4. Being thirsty???

5. Running doesn‚Äôt (usually) cause shortness of breath for me but for some reason, walking uphill does


Can anyone confirm that these are actually causing me to have asthma attacks or whether it even is asthma??"

"So I finally got approval for Fasenra, but since it‚Äôs a specialty drug my asthma/allergist office enrolled me in their co-pay program. I called my pharmacy today to order it and get the payment squared away with the debit card number my dr‚Äôs office had given me. The pharmacy couldn‚Äôt get it to go through after we tried my address &amp; the doctors office address. 

So I want to double check that I wrote all of the numbers down correctly, it‚Äôs Friday night, and both the co-pay program &amp; doctors office is closed for the weekend. They gave me a member number for this program and everything but I can‚Äôt even find a website to login to for the savings program. Can anyone assist with this? Is there a website? Do I have to wait for my enrollment kit? 

Any info would be helpful!"

"I read that not using a spacer makes it more likely to end up in he stomach.

"After asking my pulmonologist if we could consider going the biologics route (after being on montelukast + advair for 5 years with no improvement), I did a blood test a few months ago which showed that taking a biologic could be a good option for me.

Has anyone here had experience with biologics? Did you have to wait a while after submitting the application to actually receive the medication?"

Do you always take Albuterol before Symbicort? Or can the Symbicort be taken on its own?
"I had a terrible cough that wouldn't go away about 2 months back I started seeing this specialist who diagnosed me with post nasal drip and possible cough variant asthma. They put me on a inhaler and gave me a bunch of other meds. But my condition wasn't improving so they upped the dose of inhaler to 4puffs and asked me to visit back in 2 months. 

Well it's been 2 months I have taken all meds religiously but my condition hasn't really improved much I get like this constant tingling sensation in the wind pipe followed by a cough. It's very difficult to speak and sometimes I feel dizzy, i saw the doc yesterday and he said that he couldn't perform the lung function test as my condition hasn't really improved, instead he gave me even more meds now. 

This really sucks it's been 2+ months since i started treatment I still feel awful what's worse its really effecting my school as well, my parents are threatening to stop my meds if my condition doesn't improve. I am really stressed and worried. Im generally in really good shape and no history of smoking Any advice on how to improve my condition would really help"
"I‚Äôve taken red Bull in the past and it actually(temporarily atleast) made it easier to breathe. Almost as effective as my symbicort. Now, I don‚Äôt drink redbull anymore(since it is very unhealthy) but I found this really interesting.

Has anyone felt the same ? Just curious"
"I started taking Huperzine-A daily right around when I moved into my new (building is old) apartment, and unfortunately I have to share public washer/dryers while I am here temporarily.

My asthma ended up getting pretty bad. I was using my inhaler daily. I chalked it up to the old building and/or the public laundry (everyone seems to have an animal in this complex).

I ended up reading about how too much acetylcholine can lead to asthma issues(some antihistamines are also anticholinergics).  In retrospect, most Huperzine-A bottles even have a warning to asthmatics on them(not the Nutricost one I had).

Needless to say, 3-4 days after I stopped taking the Huperzine-A, my asthma got way better.  The last two days I haven't had to use my inhaler in the middle of sleep; my sleep quality has gotten way better as a result. It's pretty amazing!

So if you're into nootropics or take a calming supplement derived from Huperzia or take a lot of extra choline sources, be wary, those could be triggering your asthma and making it a lot worse.  I know it certainly did in my case!  

Kinda sad that for now that we have to choose between protecting our brains or breathing."
I feel terrible i know sometimes my symptoms would be mixed together but today its just GERD and it feels really bad and uncomfortable:(
"Hi. Many times when I would look to take an inhaler (or even the Advair/wixela diskus), I would feel that the number of puffs left would be lower than it should as if it was going down on its own. I thought I was bugging and thought that maybe one of my family members was using it. Just now, I opened a new generic ventolin box which is suppose to have 200 puffs only to see it had 192 puffs. This confirmed my suspicion that the number of puffs was decreasing on its own.

Has this ever happened to anyone? And could the way that I have my inhaler positioned on a flat surface be the cause? I try to have my inhalers in the box standing straight but sometimes it would get knocked down."
"Having had asthma for decades now and having just about anything as a trigger. one of them I had unbeknownst was heartburn.  Never knew this was a thing but apparently, the same way heartburn acids can reach your heart, as you can imagine they can reach inside your lungs as well, causing irritation and a subsequent attack.  Once went to the ER and in fact received heartburn meds not a nebulizer and was fine for it.

If you're someone who gets heartburn or eats spicy foods, or whose stomach may have become more sensitive to foods due to a change in diet or maybe pregnancy, consider whether or not this might be the cause and address it - remove heartburn-inducing foods from diet, try an antacid before an inhaler.

I say all this because inhalers and particularly corticosteroids have [a range of side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531462/) (*Ctrl F adverse effects*) that can make a huge difference in your overall health long-term.  Speaking as someone who's been on them for decades.

"Hi guys, I‚Äôll try break it down for you quickly.

So I‚Äôm 26. I start smoking when I was 14. Have stopped since December as I‚Äôve a bkb fight upcoming. Throughout my 12 week camp, I have dropped 2 stone and am presumably fit enough as I can jog 3-4 mile. 
Basically when I get into a intense moment of excerise ie. sparring, after a minute or two, from what I believe it to be, it seems to trigger off EIB episodes. I can physically feel the tubes connecting to my lungs not tightening, but closing. My body starts to shut down, while my opponent pummels me into the face. I am powerless to defend myself when I‚Äôm like this. I am watching and anticipating every shot coming at me but this lung problem is sapping every bit of energy from me. I start seeing stars and start blacking out, to where my body naturally curls up to defend itself. To where I have to exit the ring after a minute or so with my head hanging in shame because I can‚Äôt make it through a 3 minute round.

So when I was out for food yesterday with my son, I was going through all the symptoms trying to diagnose my condition. I had ruled out asthma early on because google results suggest that it takes awhile to recover, where as mine (EIB I belive) doesn‚Äôt take so long to recover from. But at this point I was trying to source some diazepam because I believed I was simply having panic attacks as I have had mental health issues in the past, and had exhausted all other possibilities.

I ended up coming across EIB anyways and was certain by looking at the symptoms this is what I have, especially as it only triggers when the intensity becomes too much. So I went to A&amp;E done x rays and they came back clear. But I was persistent with them I wanted an inhaler there and then and they ended up giving me one.

I then went for a 2 mile jog when I came back and I am now absolutely 99% convinced that I have EIB. My energy levels were crazy high. I jogged the two mile relvently easy,and sprinted roughly 200m in style before it triggered the EIB.

My problem is, although it did help a lot, it didn‚Äôt fully prevent it. Like I can‚Äôt turn around to my opponent mid fight and say can u not punch me for 30 seconds mate forgot my inhaeler üòÇ 

Is there anyone with similar experience? What did you use to FULLY PREVENT the episodes? God bless."
"I know that if u suddenly stop taking symbicort there can be withdrawal symptoms (nausea, headache, dizziness ect.) ice been having these symptoms but i only didnt take it for a day and a half, im just tryna figure out if its from the symbicort or not."
"I'm a 26 F who's always had a bit of asthmatic problems throughout my life. It all kind of started when I moved to this city at 6 yrs old and sort of stuck since. 
A few years ago I finally convinced my doctor to run an allergy test on me and I found out I was basically allergic to almost all the main species of plants in my city, plants in general(pollen), cats, dogs, and horses etc. 
I was wanting to get treatment for it but adding it all up it was going to be fairly expensive so instead I stuck by my usual medications- Pro Air Inhaler, Zyrtec, Claritin D, saline sprays, and steaming.

Fast forward to this year, I had caught covid back in January despite keeping super cautious (Masks, Hand Washing, Social Distancing, and Getting Vaxxed.) 
I especially took precautions because I had been pregnant and asthmatic. I hadn't necessarily changed any of my precautions when I did have my baby but grandparents have been around more often. 

Now I'm sick again and my asthma is acting up I feel like I had just finally started to recover from covid and I'm physically and mentally exhausted from being sick back to back.
My baby thankfully seems to be ok despite a slight runny nose. However, I had been to several places to be seen Primary Doc, Care Spot, and ER. I've asked for a nebulizer and they would shrug it off despite my physical distress. Not really surprising from my PCP since she's been difficult to get help from but a bit so from the others. 

I ended up buying a nebulizer from Amazon because of all this but now I'm not exactly sure if I can use it without the prescription medication for it.
I was wanting to know if it's possible to use it with just plain water or if there's something I could use with it that's over the counter for my asthma and consistent cough?

I anticipate being sick again since my daughter's now in daycare due to work but I want to take preventative measures.
If there's any other things that have helped you please let me know as well- I'd really appreciate it!"
"this is an emergency. my doctor is an asshole and has refused to renew my asthma prescriptions. I have severe asthma and am about to run out of my rescue inhaler. 

is there any way I can get a new one without a prescription? I am severely immune compromised and thus can not leave my house to go to an urgent care or hospital."
Anyone know if it‚Äôs safe to take advair with mucinex? I‚Äôve had a cough for about 3 months and it‚Äôs improved tremendously since I was prescribed advair. Still dealing with a ridiculous amount of mucus though.
"I was recently diagnosed. I just don't breathe as well as I should. But to my knowledge it has never been bad enough to gasp for air or feel like suffocating.

I also take ADHD stimulants which I feel kind of do help?

My grandmother has it too and she only uses her inhaler as needed.

I am mostly worried about tolerance or needing to up doses until there's nothing to do anymore or I have too many side effects.

If I have never had an asthma attack ever, what is the point of preventative inhalers every single day? My main concern is just that I could fjnction better mentally and physically, have more energy.

Does anyone take budesonide with a lower frequency like that?"

"Sometimes I have shortness of breath out of nowhere. I have to take deep breaths and feel air hunger. It makes falling asleep hard, sometimes it even wakes me up.

A functional med doc recommended i try IV drips of glutathione.

Any advice would be helpful,  thanks!"
"Hello, r/Asthma 

I'm not too sure if I'm meant to be here or not, but my doctor has given me some inhalers to 'test' to see if they work to reduce some shortness of breath/chest tightness I am experiencing. I've used the inhaler a few times, and am unsure if it's working yet. So, I thought I'd ask, is there a way it's meant to feel after inhalation? 

If helpful, i've been given a Salamol CFC-Free inhaler at 100 MCG. When I use it, the shortness of breath/chest tightness seems to pass in about 15-20 mins when previously it may last a number of hours. But, I have only used it twice, so no clue yet whether or not it's actually effective or this is some sort of placebo."
"Asthma flare up in 2020 (after we had mold removed from our home, maybe its the cause?) 2 years later after a ton of Symbicort that did NOTHING, abuse of rescue inhalers, xrays, PFT's, Trellegy worked for a while then shit the bed, now doc is considering Fasenera??? 

Anyone else try this? Anyone else get kicked in the face with severe adult onset out of a healthy lifestyle? My mother smoked all her life, had part of her lung removed and does fine on Symbicort/some o2 as needed. 

Also worth noting I maintain excellent shape, compete in power lifting at 225-230, still manage to run 3-5 miles regularly, sprints etc ( can do any cardiovascular as long as I take enough rescue meds prior/after), eat healthy with dialed in nutrition.  

I guess a good part of this is venting....... everything I can control is accounted for and the lack of control is beyond frustrating (I KNOW i'm preaching to the choir in this subreddit)"

"My allergist prescribed me symbicort last week to start a maintenance routine. I was previously doing ventolin and qvar together, as needed, but it didn‚Äôt seem to be helping me get over a bad winter flare up.

I‚Äôve been on symbicort for one week now (two puffs twice a day) and am starting to feel like my vocal chords/throat is weakening? I‚Äôm clearing my throat a lot and feel like I need to strain to talk. 

I gargle and rinse my mouth after taking it, as I did with qvar. 

Is this a normal side effect and will it hopefully go away? I‚Äôm also having some trouble breathing but I think it‚Äôs the weather, stress and the switching of meds maybe"

"Has anyone experienced their asthma improving after having COVID? 

I've almost completely stopped taken my blue ventolin inhaler since catching COVID last year and I used to take it twice daily for 20+ years."

"As the title says basically. I've seen a ton of people in here talking about using their inhaler 8-20 times a day during bad times. That is not an acceptable or safe method. If you are that bad off. You should be on a dose of oral steroids prescribed by doctor(you need a pulmonologist if you have asthma not a regular doctor.). 

Yes steroids are bad for you long term. A dose here and there for a normal person is not gonna mess you up. You take them only as long as you need them. So many asthmatics die by relying too much on an emergency inhaler."

"Hey y'all, so i have badly controlled asthma, which i think has been getting worse.
My main symptom is usually asthma cough pretty much all of the time.
Recently after my latest cold / lung infection a few weeks ago i have been feeling like its getting really difficult to clear the mucus out of my lungs.
The cold has gone about 2/3 weeks ago but when i inhale to cough, its like i can't grip onto the mucus and push it up. Its hard to explain but its like i'm coughing past the mucus. My lungs feel like they're filling up quickly and I'm constantly labouring to bring up even the smallest amounts of phlegm. 
Do any of you have this problem? 
Its making me super anxious right now, the rescue inhaler isn't doing too much to help.
I'm even wondering whether this means i have COPD?

Pls help, personal experiences and reassuring words would be appreciated.

PS: seeing the doctor first thing in the morning but need to calm down."

"(21 ,5,11, 230 pounds) I‚Äôve been posting on here for quite a while for the past month. back history I‚Äôm 21 had asthma as a little kid been smoking weed heavly for a year and half but. 2 years of total smoking. I had smokers cough and on and off sore throat since July but it goes away after a couple of days got Covid a week later after being negative if you seen my last post I was having big problems with my throat irritation/soreness , globis and swallowing( this week my throat almost feels completely normal) just feels a little inflamed everything else went away, I still can‚Äôt eat or drink as much I use to) here‚Äôs the problem ever since my throat got better my breathing got worse, cough came back it feels more heavier I‚Äôm waking up feeling completely clogged( inflamed/ tight throat and chest) bad nose congestion( stuffed in runny, nothing really comes out except clear sometimes bubbly mucas I think it is, constant throat clearing I have a peak flow and it‚Äôs usually 540to 560 or when I feel bad it‚Äôs around 460 to 500 but when I wake up it goes all the way to 320 to 366 was the highest I believe.

"Hi, I am a 21 year old male and I recently had an asthma attack and have been prescribed prednisolone 30mg for 5 days, but reading the side effects such as lowering testosterone, puffing the face and weakening the immune system has made me very scared of taking them. Looking for advice on whether I should take them or not"
"Hi folks, I am thankfully in normal care now after rushed visit to ER last night and I thought I might recount my experience here in case it might be relevant to anyone in this sub, and get your advice.

I am a relatively healthy 31 yo with a history of mild asthma, without any prior hospitalization in my life. I only needed to take preventative inhaler (flixotide) and rarely Ventolin (at home) some years back, and have gone without any sthma medication the past 2 years without any asthma attacks.

Always thought I was good, until last Thursday night, when I got an asthma attack out of nowhere. I rushed to get Ventolin and afterwards it was better, but I needed to take like 10 puffs in the next 22 hours so I went to meet a doctor immediately Friday night and received some extra medication for better control (symbicort and medrol). Doctor said this was enough to remove the attacks, and I should just re-visit after 7-14 days if any issues/for monitoring.

The prescribed medication did not improve my condition in the next 3-4 days and I still needed to take 6-8 puffs of Ventolin per day on top of that. I thought I should just keep using Ventolin while waiting for this new prescription to take effects. (I checked online and 8 puffs of Ventolin per day is still within the range the body can take). But then Tuesday afternoon, I had another attack, used Ventolin, and this time there is something different, I felt my legs (and later my hands) started to feel very shaky and I hear my heart pounding. This was not normal, nothing like this had never happened to me before. I called a cab to the nearest hospital.

This was the worst cab ride in my life, I thought I'd die on the taxi. It was quickly getting harder and harder to breathe and I kept on getting a new puff from my ventolin every minute during the whole ride, panicking, and I felt nothing in my feet and started to lose control in my hands too. I stupidly thought I was losing oxygen to survive and the limbs are gone first. I focused all my strength on my fingers in order to push down on the Ventolin, and felt the strength fading as I gradually could only insert force on one finger, my middle finger to push on my inhaler, then afterwards this little force faded too, I dropped my inhaler and felt paralyzed. No feelings in my hand and I saw my fingers curled strangely but not due to my move, like watching someone's hand. Horrible thoughts rushed through my head when we arrived in the hospital. As I could not move they had to drag me out of the taxi and carry me to ER. My mind was fully conscious, I think, and I kept on going over in my head the word asthma, my name, address, to ensure I could tell them the important info.

They proceeded to put a lot of things on me, something to breathe in, Na+, got my blood test, after 1-2 hrs I gradually breathed better and sensory came back to my hand and feet. But I was very weak, shaky, and not felt like myself. They took my chest x-ray with me lying down. Late in the evening, the doctor said to me something about low potassium in blood, which I recalled reading somewhere before that it was a side effect of the inhalers...

Now I am feeling much better, getting a lot of antibiotic, kali clorid pills, and aerosol spray twice today, still having some episodes of feeling hard to breathe but at least I am inside the hospital and feel safer about getting help soon enough when I need it. 

I am still confused why my potassium level in blood is so low. My blood test taken 1 hour after admission later read 2.7 mmol/L. I don't know if the level was low from before and the inhaler escalated the drop of potassium in blood I just had a regular health check 2 weeks ago which came out great including kidney function, so I assume everything was fine and this situation is 100% due to the asthma medications I have taken the last 3-4 days, including my 20 puffs in the taxi. Did I almost kill myself? I am still afraid now that I will get another attack and be gone. The doctor said I am also under some anxiety attack and that my asthma is better now with their treatment, but I do not feel it is working as fast as I would like. I am not back to who I was and the strength I had just one week ago. Slight movements now made me short for breaths. During those times I can't talk to my mom, only type. I don't know what is the trigger for these attack. They also tested covid and I am negative.

Do any folks here have experience with fast way to recover from low potassium in blood?  Did anyone experience asthma attacks that your doctors say come from your anxiety? How do you deal with it? I am just afraid that if I get through this, I will be scarred in my mind for a long time and unable to go on any trips, hike any mountains, do anything that keep me far from a hospital ER."
"So I have pretty bad asthma, at least once a month id need my nebulizer up until I was a teen, then against advice id take my generic Ventolin inhaler like 8 times a day. I was a heavy video game nerd and barely exercised so it never really effected me other than a quick puff every couple hours. I knew I needed to get on preventers and actually have my doctor look at me. Fast forward to 4 years ago (im 25, so 21 years old) I started heavy sport (4 times a week x  1.5 hours high intensity average). I put on a lot of weight, felt heavier and healthier than ever. But I could never survive for more than a couple minutes, and even a jog for warm up would bring me to a gasping sweaty mess. Now 4 years later, 3 months ago I'm, on proper preventative inhalers and still training just as hard. Heres the thing. 4 years later, 3 months of proper meds, literally after my warm up job I'm gasping for breath and feel like I need to sit out? I know I neglected my lungs for a long time but im young and 4 years into training and even walking up and down the stairs at home brings my heart rate up. its hard to stay motivated, my coaches and team mates think im just being lazy and not trying hard enough. 

  
TLDR - 4 years of sport/3 months of proper meds and still out of breath warming up for sport."
"Last year when I was still on Symbicort I had spirometry values of

FEV1: 3,58 88%  
FVC: 4,52 89%  
F2575: 3,05 76%

So I stopped taking Symbicort(corticosteroids/budosinide) because I just didn't want to life on steroids anymore and see how I would do without.  
Now almost a year later I get these values on my spirometry test

FEV1: 3,38 82%  
FVC: 4,41 87%  
F2575: 2,67 65%

Is it normal that my values drop so much because I stop with a certain medicine or is there something else going on?"
So I‚Äôve always had like a constant shortness of breath and when ever i exercise it quickly gets worse. Im not really sure like its been like this since i was around 7-9 I‚Äôm not really sure anymore cause its been so long but i haven‚Äôt gone to my parents about it or a doctor simply cause I‚Äôm scared to but i was just curious if it might be asthma.
Anybody tried out Alvesco by any chance? I became interested in the fact that it seems to have lower systemic side effects than other ICS therapies. Would love to from about anybody who has used it. Thanks for your input!
"I got a bad cough two years ago. Ever since it developed quite differently from month to month. In the beginning it was very aggressive and it would wake me up in the night. I was and I‚Äôm a smoker only that I was smoking more then. 

I think the smoking and the dust from my student dorm back then triggered it also I moved back then from my home country to the UK. So maybe all 3 had an impact on the trigger. Before moving I was totally fine. 

My condition kept getting worse, I started cutting smoking but then I kept having asthma like attacks and covid started. I called the doctor after a couple of months telling them how bad I felt even doe it wasn‚Äôt as bad as it is now. 

I had an active job for the past year and the asthma kept bothering me at night mostly. The job was outside/warehouse which were dusty again. 

I had this past year a repeated prescription for Ventolin and it wouldn‚Äôt last me 3 weeks. So I kept using them even doe they were almost over. But I couldn‚Äôt break an asthma attack without a puff. 

I went home last November, and during that time my mom bought me 5 boxes of Ventolin. In 2 months I used all 5. And it made me feel fine. Came back to the Uk with 5 more and used them all in 1 month. 

Meanwhile I had to get a new GP because I moved places. And they need to check my asthma or else they won‚Äôt give me the Ventolin. 

I also didn‚Äôt quit smoking and I kept overusing the inhalers. Right now I barely can walk a from one place to the other outside without getting an asthma attack. I get one if I speak to fast, if I lift someone, if I walk too much etc. I need to quit cigarettes but I don‚Äôt know how to quit the Ventolin without dying. I literally have a few puffs left and my appointment is in March. Any advice (please don‚Äôt bully me , I have issues controlling myself from addictions)"

I get chest tightness, some wheezing, and just an overall tired/muscle burning feeling in my lungs but this all goes away after I use the inhaler. 

I know it's not good to use a rescue inhaler too much and I guess I should probably be on some sort of controller medication, but until my next appointment, how often should I be using this rescue inhaler? If I use it when I have symptoms, then I'd be using it every day, probably multiple times a day. Now that I know what breathing can feel like, I also feel miserable if I don't use it. 

I also have no idea what level of symptoms warrant use of the inhaler... Sometimes my wheezing is slight so I can only hear it at the end of my breath with my mouth open, sometimes it's the whole exhale but I still can't really hear it without my mouth open. Should I be using it in those scenarios?"

"Hey everyone - i wanted to ask how you all feel after having an asthma attack. In December, i had a severe attack after being sick and trying to exercise - i ended up being ambulanced to the ER from work, and for DAYS afterward, my body felt like i had run a marathon and then been hit by a bus!  So much so that i couldn‚Äôt work for a few days after being discharged from the hospital. Since then, my meds have been switched and i have felt much better. A few weeks ago, i had a mild attack that i was able to get under control with my relief inhaler and a few rounds of my nebulizer for the following two or three days. I didn‚Äôt feel nearly as awful as i did after the attack in December, but i still felt very tired for the few days after. Has anyone else experienced this kind of exhaustion? Do you typically power through it or take extra time to rest?"
"I‚Äôve been suspected asthmatic since I was FOUR. Since I was four! But they didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äòstick the wrong label on me‚Äô! I‚Äôm 18 this year and I just got a full and official diagnosis. I don‚Äôt have to take my dads ventolin before, they have me on steroids, finally. I‚Äôm so relieved. I had to be hospitalised for anyone to notice me but god those four days on oxygen were nothing compared to my years of self - poorly - medicated of suffering.

I can finally explain it all. I‚Äôm so happy. I‚Äôm so fucking happy."
"My girlfriend is into hiking and I kinda like it‚Ä¶ at least enough to want to join her. But I have exercise induced asthma and I can do long flat walks no problem but up-hill‚Ä¶ I have to stop every minute or two. I got an albuterol inhaler but it only seems to help me catch my breath a little faster once I‚Äôm already stopped and out of breath.

Is there any treatment that will let me make it all the way up the hill without stopping? The rest of my body can do it just fine‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just my lungs stopping me.

Thanks!"
"Hey! I had a asthma flare up after a cold and it was awful, had a hard time sleeping and what not. It's much better now and I feel like my lungs has recovered. 

Although taking 8 doses of my regular inhaler have made me really sore in my throat and I am coughing because it's irritated and I got some mucus building up. I always rinse with water and gurgle after I use my inhaler. I drink a lot of water. Tried tea with honey. Do you have any tips on how to relieve me from this? I want to sleep.. thank you so much in advance!"

"I forgot my inhaler at home and after a fiasco where my doctor promised to send my albuterol prescription to the pharmacy near where I was at, flying out from another state, I had to get Primatine mist to save me from an asthma attack. My flight leaves in an hour, so unfortunately I have no option of getting the prescription when I‚Äôm in California because I won‚Äôt have a car. 

I will only have that Primatine for four days, three of which will have a LOT of walking. Will that be enough to get me through? When I get home, I will obviously have my Albuterol again. 

I am also Autistic so my panic levels about this are extremely high and I am really scared.

Thank you in advance!!"
Obviously post apocalypse we only last as long as our medication so what are some ways we could extend our life a little further or what are some natural remedies for asthma so we don‚Äôt all suffocate after surviving running from zombies lol (yes the zombie thing is silly but seriously what do we do)
Can we talk about how it‚Äôs absolute bullshit that while I was in high school my asthma was not a good enough medical excuse to keep me from running A FUCKING MILE every Monday. Therefore wasting tons and tons of inhaler puffs and medicine just to get a grade in PE. People are insensitive because they ‚Äúknow someone with asthma and it‚Äôs not that bad‚Äù and I fucking hate it
Is there anybody else on here who has cartoonishly bad asthma? I have at least 3 attacks a day and I could just be sitting there. Most nights and I do mean most during the winter I have to wake up in the middle of the night barely breathing to turn on my nebulizer. Everyone else I know with asthma just has mild asthma and doesn‚Äôt need to carry an inhaler at all. I feel alone in this struggle and would just like to know if there‚Äôs anyone else out there like me cause 18 years later (I was diagnosed at 5) and I have never met anyone else with asthma as bad as mine

"In the process of diagnosis, triggers are smoke/cooking fumes and exercise.

I wanted to wait until proper diagnosis to start a daily steroid like flovent, but I had two bad attacks this weekend, and decided to cave in and try it out. 

 Supposed to be on it for a month to see if it helps. First and second dose taken during my attack, made me cough a bit more and felt a little dizzy but otherwise ok. 

Third dose made me vomit, diarrhea, red hot and itchy face, itchy skin all over, and weakness with dizziness. It was worst at about 30 min to 1 hour after taking the dose, but mostly resolved after 2 or 3 hours. 

Has anyone else had these side effects at first? Do they go away after a while?"
"I just recently had an asthma attack, and thankfully by nebulizer and some hot water was able to bring me back to normal, but during the attack I was panicking because it matched the symtpoms of a heart attack -- sharp chest pain, sensitivity in the arms, and the feeling of a weight on my chest.

Anyone know how to tell the difference between the 2? Just so anxiety doesn't hinder my next attack again."
"i was put on advair many years ago for moderate uncontrolled asthma , it really helped me . few years ago i had to stop it . at the time i guess you can say my asthma was in ‚Äú remission ‚Äú last year i noticed i was getting worse symptoms and they would last all day and worse each time i wasnt feeling well . one day i woke up , and it felt as though my asthma was acting up when i had a cold . it got to the point where i was experiencing shortness of breath chest pain and walking a few steps would trigger almost an impending doom feeling . anything like dust , smoke you name it would trigger breathlessness or a coughing fit or hyperventilating.  i started getting really scared cause if it wasnt treated it would turn into a full blown attack . since then my symptoms have gotten better but if i dont keep up my medication regimen my symptoms gradually get worse again"
"I have struggled with anxiety for years, and used to have fear that I have asthma. I've gone to doctors multiple times, and no one can give me a clear diagnosis. I've been to an allergist, he's like ""I think you have asthma? Maybe?"" but then I tried albuterol, and it did nothing to improve my situation. I think I tried advair in the past, nothing. I  definitely have chronic feeling of discomfort in my nose - always at least one nostril stuffed, always at least some mucous or something in there. 

When i feel anxious, it manifests in my chest area, and will manifest as perceived shortness of breath or sometimes light pressure. I sigh a lot, but I think that's more related to calming my nervous system and not really asthma. I think I've wheezed twice in my life - with the only time that I can remember is watching a video that made me laugh incredibly hard for about 3 minutes straight, at which point I wheezed for maybe 4 or 5 seconds and then it went away. I worked out earlier tonight for about 25 minutes on an exercise bike, and felt completely fine, but the other night I went out to have drinks with a girl I'm dating and I was coughing and feeling this weird buzzing in my chest. No wheezing, no mucous, no shortness of breath really, just a slight cough at times. The odd thing is, I've been coughing more the past week - ever since a week ago friday - and feeling this buzzing sensation, but I haven't really had any cough whatsoever for the past 2+ years. I definitely feel uncomfortable when I'm outside and it's really cold, and I can be sensitive sometimes to smells, but other than that, I just can't tell what the deal is.

It's SO frustrating that I can't get a clear diagnosis of what's going on. I KNOW I have anxiety, and I'm making huge strides with that, but these other symptoms SEEM like asthma, SEEM like allergies, yet nothing helps. Why is this so hard?"
Im going away for collage and I want to make a little meds kit for when i go. i don‚Äôt want to bring my nebulizer cuz it‚Äôs big heavy and loud can anyone suggest and small ones that are relatively quiet preferably hand held. as well as other misc things for dealing with asthma thank you üôèüèΩ

"I am opening a pharmacy that is trying to get the cost of generic medications down for those with no or crap insurance. No discount cards, games, etc.  I have absolutely had it with insurance companies and I am risking my hard earned money and my future on this. 

The cost from pharmacies varies dramatically for some meds and not much or others.  I am trying to pinpoint the avg. price that people are truly paying that don't have insurance paying for their meds.

What do you pay for your Albuterol inhaler?

What do you pay for your generic Singulair?

What other generic meds would you like to see at a less expensive price?

Are you getting gouged on any generics, if so what and where?

(notice: Not an ad, I have not included identifying info. Drug prescribing and prices differ from one town to another and data is difficult to get state/nation wide. Thank you in advance!)"

"So I recently had an asthma attack which had my parents rushing to the hospital and i was barely breathing. When i was younger I had asthma, but i never had any asthma for years ever since i was younger. Im 14 and I have been going gym for a month 4 times a week. I noticed started getting chest pains when I did dips, so I cut them from my workout. Then until now I had an asthma attack. I searched it up and I found ‚ÄòExercise induced Asthma‚Äô. So Im wondering if that was the cause of my asthma attack."
"I feel blue, depressed, particularly down emotionally during that time. Ofc could be something that happens only to me but wanted to know if anyone had similar situations during each asthma attack"
"For the last 2 weeks,  I have finally started playing basketball again in the gyms, pick up basketball game... I thought i was out of shape at first but its been 2 weeks now..

Is it asthma now at this point?"
"Hi everyone, was wondering if anyone here has excerise induced asthma and how you found out you had it. I do a lot of hiking and it's usually long distance so I rarely push my self really hard in short bursts but yesterday I decided to go for a run and didn't warm up too much before running up a long steep hill in just a few minutes. When I got to the top I was completely out of breath and felt an intense pain in the center of my chest. After a few minutes I started to catch my breath but then my throat started to tighten and I was wheezing. Then I got a cough that wouldn't go away and it was like the type of cough you get when you choke on something. I was struggling to breathe with all those symptoms and had to sit down for a while. Over the course of an hour I slowly began to feel better. After looking online it seems like I may have excerise induced asthma especially since I was running in the cold and that seems to be a factor that can trigger it. Never had something like this happen before and I'm 22 and never had any type of asthma before this. If you guys think this might be excerise induced asthma let me know and what treatments you guys use. I'm thinking of going to the doctor to get it checked out. Thanks for reading my long ass post!"
Anybody take it? Seems to have fewer systemic side effects than the old school theophylline. I'm interested in the drug as it's implicated as being particularly effective for nocturnal asthma. It is marketed as having the benefits of theophylline without the blood level monitoring and long list of contraindications. Interested to hear experiences.
"Hello I recently bought a peak flow becuse I have been having problems my average goes around from 480 to 560 depends on the time. Yesterday I ran and I felt bad heavy breathing after words and I got 330 I assume it was becuse of the runing I used my nebulizer and went back to 556 but today I woke up feeling very congested in the chest in throat and I used my peak flow and it went to 300 again until I used the nebulizer and went to 511 what‚Äôs does this mean, should I be worried, I have been wheezing more frequently this week and history of asthma As a little kid"

I‚Äôve been on Breo for about 4 weeks and  even tho I gargle, use mouthwash, and brush my teeth immediately after I use it, I guess I still got it. Any other tips for what I can do to prevent it? I thought I was doing everything I could.

"Hi everyone,

I have mild asthma; I take a low dose corticosteroid daily for my asthma (asmanex twisthaler) and have a salbutamol inhaler. 

I‚Äôve never actually had an asthma attack so I‚Äôm quite confused as to what signs to look for. 

Sometimes when I get really anxious or have panic attacks I feel like it‚Äôs harder to breathe. I‚Äôm not wheezing or anything, and I‚Äôm breathing just fine it just feels like I‚Äôm not getting enough air in my lungs. Is this an asthma attack or anxiety attack? I noticed it didn‚Äôt improve when I used my salbutamol, but when I started to calm down it went away."
"For the record, I take public transportation that includes light rail.  Today, I was on the light rail system, and I just needed to get to one stop.  In the car, there was some weird guy who thought it was a great idea to light up and smoke some weed, something that is TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO on public transit.

Thankfully, I had my mask on, but I had to tell the guy not to light up on the light rail system (no pun intended) because there might be people like me who are asthmatic.  The guy didn't say anything to me but just smiled, which irritated me (someone at work told me that he was probably too stoned out of his mind to respond).

"Thank goodness, my asthma has been maintained pretty well recently. But Girl Scout cookie season is upon us and digging into some thin mints (only 4!) I had an asthma attack.

I have a cough that is bad when I lay down or go outside. It feels like a tickle and makes me cough and I can‚Äôt stop. I am on salbutamol because I had a attack that made me dizzy and light headed from the coughing fit. It seems to be bad around winter time. I went to another doctor and he sad it doesn‚Äôt sound like classic asthma and it could be a cough variant asthma. He said I shouldn‚Äôt need to take salbutamol 2 times a day but the other doc said that was fine. I am being sent for a challenge test idk what that is. But he said in one week if I don‚Äôt improve I will go on Flovent as he‚Äôs not sure why I am coughing. Salbutamol does provide relief from the coughing fits. What do you all think?

"That's the title says, my son's friend has asthma. He's 13. He has said that he has an Albuterol prescription, but loses his inhalers and usually just uses a nebulizer at home.

Today, he had a bit of an asthma event while at my house, but his parents weren't home for me to get him to his nebulizer. Fortunately, it wasn't a serious event and between having him sit up in a chair, breathing in a bag (at his stepdad's suggestion), and giving him a cup of coffee (based on information I found online and approved by stepdad), he recovered in a half hour or so.

I'm wondering if there are any OTC medications I could get to keep at my house, just in case. I saw something about Primatene Mist through a few web searches, but I'm unfamiliar enough I thought I'd ask Reddit while waiting for Monday to roll around so I can call my GP for his suggestion."
"I recently found out that I have uncontrolled asthma. My doctor wants me to take singulair. I am a bit worried about taking it because of the black box warning regarding psychiatric side effects.

How they just keep on going.

Anyone here broke the cycle? How?

Hi folks. So I‚Äôm having trouble paying for my Qvar prescription. I had assistance but it ended. I was wondering if anyone had any experience taking half as much of a higher dosage?

Has said he doesn‚Äôt need to see anymore despite me still having the issues in the evenings as my attacks have stopped.

Current medication info: I have albuterol for emergency purposes but I don't get full-blown asthma attacks. My PCP from 2017 prescribed me that since I had terrible allergies and he suspected I have allergic asthma. Currently, I am taking Flovent HFA. I only started about a month ago and I haven't noticed any improvements. I have a pulmonary function tests coming up in April.

"Excuse my english, I'm from Austria.

I know this might seem utterly stupid to everyone here but...

I (26m) have mild allergic asthma (cathair, doghair), take my Symbicort inhaler twice a day.
I quit smoking 3 months ago because of Covid.

I am unvaxxed because I am scared of the side effects the vaccines may cause. 
Although i really want to get the vaccine made by Valneva, because i kinda trust this sort of vaccines more.
A friend of mine got a pulmonary embolism two weeks after he received his second shot. That was 2 days before my initial vaccine-date but i backed out almost dying from fear...

I was always cautious, wearing masks, avoiding people, all that stuff..

But now, my girlfriend contracted it and it's just a matter of time when my symptoms are going to start.

Do I have to be scared an have to take any sort of precaution?

I know this might trigger many of you, but right now I'm looking for some good advice..

I'm kinda scared right now.."
With the storms battering the UK I'm suffering. Does anyone else get this?
"In the UK we have a brown and blue inhaler otherwise known as reliever and preventer.
My preventer ran out almost 2 weeks ago and due to me having long covid, i feel that it helps massively with the breathing symptoms i get from it. On a morning now when i don‚Äôt have it i feel short of breath when sitting up straight in a chair and just general worse breathing throughout the day. I never used to have bad asthma problems before i caught covid in july and i believe that‚Äôs what brought it out in me again. I could go months without using either inhaler and be absolutely fine. 

Are what i‚Äôm experience long covid symptoms just getting worse or can stopping my brown inhaler cause them to get worse? 
I have of course re ordered my preventers as i feel there‚Äôs a direct correlation between when i stopped and how my symptoms have got worse.

I‚Äôm essentially looking for reassurance at the same time, i hate how long covid has brought out my asthma again, i can‚Äôt describe but breathing just really doesn‚Äôt feel the same as it did.

Anything on this would be appreciated"
"So I also have a host of other diagnosed and mystery ailments, and as you can imagine I have spent much of the pandemic avoiding public places. Especially medical ones.

Which meant I lapsed on my prescriptions for my inhalers while also ending up having to have several organs removed at the same time. I only went to the doctor for emergencies. Not for my asthma.

Having finally sucked my last inhaler dry and then having an acid reflux episode (which makes my asthma soooo much worse) and then having to figure out how to get it filled without leaving the house because I have been sick for days (those darn pre-existing conditions, looking at you endometriosis and vasovagal response) ‚Ä¶

Anyway, don‚Äôt be me. Call and get your appt tomorrow. I lucked out and found someone who could help, but it was damn hard to find telehealth for asthma that didnt require a PCP intake. Now I am on extra meds for the acid and my inhalers are shiny and full."

So I wasn‚Äôt a heavy smoker; but I did smoke about 3-4 cigarettes per day and I quit smoking all together about 4 days ago.

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with asthma ever since I was young, but recently as I have started going to the gym, it‚Äôs starting to come back again.

I find myself using my inhaler almost everyday. Today I couldn‚Äôt breath throughout the whole day and I left my albuterol inhaler at home. When I got home I took maybe 6-8 puffs.

I know it is possible to take too much, but is this amount safe? I don‚Äôt regularly take an amount this large. But I was just worried that I might hurt myself lol

"Has anyone here with exercise induced asthma figured out a way to exercise without needing an inhaler??

This would be a dream come true for me"
[removed]
"I had my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù asthma attack last spring at 30yrs old. With an extensive background in first aid, the audible wheezing was a dead giveaway.  My stethoscope was not needed at all.  And having just gone for a run and come in from the cold, it was easy to see what triggered it. 

Being Covid times and all, my doctor took my diagnosis at face value and prescribed me a rescue inhaler over the phone.  Have used it a few times but even the first attack I didn‚Äôt necessarily feel like I NEEDED it.... 
because that‚Äôs what exercise has felt like my whole life! When they‚Äôd make me run track and field in elementary school.... When they‚Äôd make me do the friggin‚Äô beep test in high school....  running in particular has always felt like that although there hasn‚Äôt previously been audible wheezing.  

So, my question is, does being out of breath and a mild asthma attack feel the same to you? Have I just had undiagnosed exercise induced asthma my whole life?"
I'm currently doing albuteral neb treatments and have been for months. I do it 3-4x daily. My doc just prescribed me the flovent hfa inhaler I'm horrified to even try it. Scared I will die or have bad allergic reaction. Anyone else on this inhaler?? Is it safe?? My anxiety is so bad.

"So my brother wants me to send some inhalers for his use to US via parcel because his insurance does not cover the cost and there are other hassles about it.

Before anyone asks how i can get it is because ....

Anyone has any experience if and how i can send overseas?"
"Hello, im just looking for some advice. I have been smoking weed daily for a little over 2 years. I have never had issues with my asthma, just the occasional flaring up.

Over the past month, it has gotten horrendous - every single hit I take, I immediately get wheezy, huge amounts of mucus built up in my lungs, and I have to sit there and cough it all up, then hit my inhaler.

I figured it was just something seasonal, but it's just been getting worse. Is this common? Do I simply just need to give my lungs a break and they will be back to normal?

This kind of just started happening out of the blue. Literally every time I smoke weed I HAVE to have my inhaler on standby, it's about a 50/50 of whether it's going to trigger my asthma or not."
"I had to call my doctor a week ago to get my rescue inhaler refilled. They finally called it through and it's not covered by my insurance. The pharmacy called the doctor's office to get it changed to something covered by my insurance, and I just got a phone call saying my doctor won't make any changes until I come in for a check up.  My dad's in the hospital I can't go 30 mins away to an doctors appointment at the moment, and she won't fill it until I'm seen. I am pissed!  I only have a few puffs left..."
"I had allergic rhinitis that devolved into asthma around 2 years back. Symptoms are mostly mild, but they can be moderately severe if allergen exposure is high enough. Coughing, wheezing, and slight throat tightness is usually all that I get. I think I am allergic to mice, but I haven't got tested, so I am not sure. I was prescribed montelukast in combination with antihistamine in the beginning, which worked great for some time, but gradually lost its efficacy. Even upping the dosage has no effect.

 I tried fluticasone propionate inhaler but that made me very anxious and agitated. And I only took 1-2 puffs of 44mcg, the lowest possible dosage I think. Trying to wait it out did not work. In fact, I tried it multiple times. So, I don't think I can tolerate fluticasone.

Given that I responded to fluticasone in this way, will other inhaled corticosteroids affect me similarly? Or is it possible that some other might suit me more. Are there any other medications that i can try?"
"This question might come off a bit odd - I am so sorry, but I have to ask.

My doctor recently prescribed something for bronchospasm to me (salbutamol, spray - 1 puff per day during 'attacks' or what you call it - I don't have ""I can't breathe at all attacks - more like something is constricting flow of air into the lungs). It made / makes sense as my dad has asthma and has had it for years.

Since using it I have a bit of a globe sensation in certain positions. It says in the side-effects label that quite a few get irritation in their throat, so I am not thinking a lot about that bit for now.

However I don't think it helps me all that much. Maybe a tiny bit.

Do you guys opt for the cheapest version of the medication? Or is there a brand that is better than others? Where I live it is mandatory for the pharmacist to ask me if I want the cheapest product available, and I said yes. But now I am unsure as to whether or not there is difference in quality.

And has anyone else experienced getting little to no effect from 1 puff?

I just really want to not think about breathing all the time."
"I never had issues with breathing before covid. I left isolation in September 2021 since then I have dry cough chest pains in various locations and upper back pain. My GP says it‚Äôs beginning of mild asthma / costochondritis but my back pain worries me. I have it all time. My O2 saturation is 98-100. My peak flow measurements are within the norm 450-460 sometimes 440 or 470, 480. She prescribed Ventolin inhaler but I haven‚Äôt tried it yet. Will it help? I‚Äôm really worried I have anxiety and other GP dismissed me saying it‚Äôs all from anxiety, because my x ray was fine. I can see their hesitation in referring me to long covid clinic because of xray is normal. Not sure what to do now?"

"I'm 17 years old and I tested positive for covid, the symptoms were mild except that I felt that my asthma from before puberty came back. When breathing out a weird noise came out and i felt pain when swallowing. Now I tested negative for covid but now my chest felt itchy inside and I feel like a small child is sitting on my chest. I haven't had a asthma attack since 11 or 12 and I don't have any inhalers on me. Should I go to the clinic for this minor inconvenience? Itchiness in my chest also appeared when I was in puberty."
"I went to the doctor today to have my asthma diagnosed. I asked for a spirometry exam, which they did. However, the doctor also had me drop my pants for a testicular exam. 

Is this usually performed for an asthma diagnosis? I just found it odd as I can‚Äôt see the connection, then again I‚Äôm not a doctor.."
"I've had asthma for 50+ years. 

Life was hell before rescue inhalers.

But I went a long time using nothing but rescue inhalers. Culminating in ever more frequent visits to the ER.

A, what I considered, near death experience about 15 years ago made me a believer in preventative inhalors.

I haven't been back to the ER since.

My asthma is relativily under control ...... even though I still use a rescue inhaler daily ....... just to knock off the slightest of wheeze.

I haven't experienced a real attack in decades, but that experience is buried in my psyche.

The only time I get asthma attacks these days ...... is in my dreams. Occasionally, I will wake up gasping from the dream. 

Anyone else had similar dreams?"
"Hi everyone,

So my asthma isn‚Äôt severe, and I‚Äôve never had an asthma attack. But lately my anxiety is going crazy and I‚Äôm scared that one day I‚Äôll die from an asthma attack. 

I take an asmanex twisthaler everyday for maintenance and I have a salbutamol inhaler in case. 

How likely am I to die? Is it rare?"
"Hey everyone, I‚Äôve had asthma my whole life and to memory when I was very young I was switched to an albuterol I haler (specifically pro air) and for some reason this little red inhaler is the only inhaler that will open me up and allow me relief when my chest gets tight/asthma is exasperated. 

My insurance doesn‚Äôt cover the brand name so I have to pay out of pocket but the generics (talking about the longer blue one) just doesn‚Äôt help my breathing at all. Why is that? Does anyone else experience something similar?

Small aside: I always have an issue with using my inhaler when it gets decently low. Like 90 puffs or below it starts to barely spray out. I usually rinse off the build up and sometimes it helps but most of the time I am forced to get a new one before I‚Äôm even below 20 puffs..

Thank you all"

"Has anyone found a coupon to make Advair HFA more affordable? My doctor wants me to go back on Advair because I've been having a lot of random asthma attacks, but my Advair is $400 WITH insurance. And I pay $400 a month for my health insurance. üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ

Is there something you‚Äôd recommend?"
Hey there so every season i get bad allergies and one thing I do is cough up mucus.I FOUND OUT TODAY THATS NOT NORMAL!!! Apparently it‚Äôs a sign I may have Asthma because I don‚Äôt smoke and I doubt I have lung disease at 19. That‚Äôs crazy. I have recently started having a hard time going up the stairs and running for long period of time. It really takes me out I breath. When I was a little kid in like elementary school I was fine I would run like the wind. Idk when it changed but could I have Asthma?? Should I get checked out by a doctor I mean like apparently I should because coughing up mucas isn‚Äôt normal so


"I have mild allergic asthma and my IgE levels have been high even when I didn't have a cat. I controlled it with medications and when I started getting better, I decided to adopt 2 cats for my mental health because I was in a bad place. 
Now my doctor says 'get rid of them immediately because you don't know what your could be allergic to' 
But they do not trigger my symptoms. And I feel normal and obviously less lonely.
Is it true that ALL who have asthma have allergy or are susceptible to pet dander? I don't know what to do. Any advice is appreciated."
"(posting again since no one saw it last time)

(apologies in advance for wall of text)

While I'm not officially diagnosed with asthma (yet) I'm pretty sure symptoms are triggered by dust. 
Cleaning out my room thoroughly was the only thing that eased the constant stuffyness and the waking up breathless. Still not back to 'normal' but with cleaning and Ventolin I can get enough sleep and go back to work. 


Here's the rub: my allergy test didn't show anything else than an intolerance towards grass pollen. In mid winter I find this unlikely to be the problem. Is it possible to have dust sensitive asthma without a ""proved"" allergy and minimal to no sounds? 


Because in addition I rarely to never have any wheezing or coughing. It has happened, early in the morning and once a severe coughing fit at a friend's house. We were drinking and gaming and he's a young guy who lives alone. So it figures his desk hadn't been dusted off in the last few months. I tasted blood on my breath and the only thing that helped was a couple puffs of Ventolin and we had to lean out the door in the snow. A tender moment with him stroking my back while I'm just gasping at the snowflakes. Felt very comforting. He has had asthma since he was a toddler so he knows his stuff. 
 

But spirometer was normal and none of the about 6 doctors I've seen the last month and a half have heard anything in my lungs.


 They chalk it up to anxiety but I wasn't showing signs of it before this (my therapist agreed to this) and anytime I've felt anxious/had mild anxiety attacks (usually because of not being believed about my problem) it doesn't really seem to trigger symptoms/an attack. It only makes them worse if they're ongoing at the same time. 


I feel very lost since it feels like all doctors I talk to only want to put me on something sedating like valium to prove it's anxiety. Had to argue to get a hold of an inhaler while I let them also prescribe this strong antihistamine that's sometimes used for anxiety/sleeping issues. I have had some use of it though. It helps me relax a bit and let's me sleep through the stuffyness. Just can't take it during the day because it makes me all zombified.


Sorry for the long post but I guess I need someone to, idk, give advice while I wait for a lungespesialist to look at me. Waiting lists are long and I have pretty much been my own doctor since January."
Hey guys. After a chat with my doctor we decided to try switching me to Advair 115/21mcg. I‚Äôm a little scared because I‚Äôve been taking the same medicine for a while and I‚Äôm not the best when it comes to new changes and things like that with my asthma but I‚Äôm willing to try it because at this point every few days I either have really high highs or super bad lows. Has anyone used Advair or have any stories while on it? Did u feel like it worked for you or felt like it didn‚Äôt do much at all I‚Äôd love to know and have any help if y‚Äôall have it!
"Im 13yo, i finally got an inhaler recently after not having one for years since my family thought it ""went away"", so, since i got it ive been having some trouble keeping track of it and bringing it everywhere i go. Today i was in P.E. and i needed it badly but i realized i had forgotten it at home. Incase this, or something similar, happens again what do you individuals do when you forget your inhaler?"
"Hey everyone. I (F18) used to have pretty bad asthma as a child and ended up taking montelukast (singular) for a year or two when I was about 8-10 ish. I believe this was before they knew it was a neuropsychiatric, since my mom herself is a nurse practitioner, and I highly doubt she would have had me taking it for my asthma (which wasn't severe enough to call for that sort of thing).

Anyways, a bit into taking singulair I developed onset tics. Since this wasn't extremely unseen in children my age we didn't think too much of it. They eventually got quite severe, which led us to trial and error taking out certain medicine I was taking. Eventually, we found out it was the singulair that was causing the issues and immediately stopped taking it.

This stopped the tics and everything seemed to be quite normal for a long time. It wasn't until late middle school that I realized my tics could still be triggered by other people with tics. I didn't remember much of the original onset since I was quite young at the time, so I didn't make the connection nor tell anyone about the triggered tics.

About a month or so into covid, my tics started redeveloping and I didn't understand what could have possibly caused it so late into my life. When tics/Tourettes develop, it's often as a child. I started doing research into montelukast and found all of the new research regarding its neurological side effects. I am genuinely so upset writing this post right now (sobbing in my dorm room) because I'm reading all of these studies focused on the damage this medicine has caused. I honestly believe my brain chemistry was altered as a child, maybe even causing mononeuropathy (which could have likely caused the persistence of tics).   


Since I'm in my first year at university (having moved countries) and having lost my primary care, I am practically in the dark when it comes to seeing someone about this. What I need right now is support.  


So with this, I ask; is there anyone else who has gone through this? I feel so alone."
"Yea. Idk what to do. I took advil in the meantime instead of Meloxicam. I do hate this chest pain though from overdoing my coughing muscles but I unfortunately have to get though it. Also, is this pain I'm feeling from coughing or the Steroid Shot from allergies? Can that Steroid Shot cause this pain from coughing? Or coughing too much caused it? Idk. Sucks"
"Good morning,
I was wondering if anyone else has taken singulair that has a history of depression. I was wondering how it effected you and if you think it‚Äôs safe. I read about mood changes being one of the side effects and it concerns me I took my first dose today but am scared to continue and make my depression/suicidal thoughts worse. Can anyone give me some info on this that has dealt with it first hand?"
"New here! 33 year old female. Back in November, I had to get a D&amp;C due to my baby not growing past 11 weeks and no heartbeat at 12 week appt. 3 days after my surgery, I ended up getting covid. Had a mild case. However, after covid I never ridded of this cough and wheezing and trouble breathing. I've been doing breathing treatments daily with a nebulizer to try and hack this crap out so I can breath again. I have an appt next month with a pulmonary doc because I need to get this under control. I did have asthma when I was little but I outgrew it. I do smoke, but I have cut back immensely and I'm picking up some nicorette today. I've also had horrible allergies ever since I found out I was pregnant that I never had before either and that hasn't went away. My anxiety is through the roof you guys. Non stop anxiety and panic attacks literally everyday. This sucks. Wondering if anyone had similar experience?? I also have to go to an allergist now as well. Ugh. I hope this goes away eventually as this is really burdening my life. I have 4 kids. Had to quit work due to all this."
"So I feel out of breath but I can still inhale as deeply as I would be able to if I wasn‚Äôt feeling out of breath, I‚Äôm new to asthma and have a smoking history, just wondering if I‚Äôve been diagnosed incorrectly"

Being horse for over a month and waiting to see an ENT to rule out VCD over asthma while having al asthma attack in my sleep last night. 

Why is this stuff so hard?"
"I‚Äôve had asthma since I was a kid. The most common triggers are cat dander, ragweed, and cold air. When I was a kid, it was also exercise induced. As an adult, it‚Äôs never really been a problem. When the ragweed or cold air would set it off, I‚Äôd steal a couple of puffs of my friend‚Äôs albuterol, and it would clear up. Cats‚Ä¶ I could cough it away after leaving the cats‚Äô house.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2021. Survived COVID in August with the help of an albuterol inhaler. Things were fine. In November we acquired a canary. By December I felt like I had bronchitis, went to urgent care, was told I had a sinus infection. They put me on antibiotics. 5 days later I returned and was told I had pneumonia. 3 weeks later after multiple rounds of nebulizers, inhalers, and antibiotics, I returned to urgent care, yet again, with breathing problems. After an x-ray they determined that I no longer had pneumonia but was having asthma attacks or bronchitis. We determined that the trigger could have been the canary. We rehomed him the next day. That was a month ago (Jan 15th). On the 19th, my breathing was so bad that I thought about going to the ER. My better half cleaned the downstairs to help with the canary dander and I felt an improvement the next day, while still taking nebulizers. By the 30th I felt well enough to finally take down the Christmas decorations. At the same time, my daughter came over to do another ‚Äúdeep cleaning‚Äù and get anything her mother may have missed.

&amp;#x200B;

Begin another downward spiral. Thankfully on February 7th, I was able to get in to see an allergist. He said I was ‚Äúthis close‚Äù to needing to go to the ER. I told him the story, and he said he wanted to stop the cycle. He gave me antibiotics, prednisone, nebulizer, albuterol, and Symbicort. He said if things stay calm, I might be able to come off the Symbicort in 6 months, and in 3 months, wants me back for an allergy test. (It‚Äôll be at least my 3rd one. I test positive for almost everything they scratch me with.) It‚Äôs been a week since I saw the allergist. The antibiotics are gone, and I have 5 days left of the prednisone taper.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve never had an attack like this before, as I mentioned in the beginning. Saturday, I fell asleep early. Sunday, we did a bit of walking, and I ended up napping in the afternoon, which is unusual for me. I feel like the walking upset my lungs, and I started taking the nebulizer more again. Just how long does this exhaustion last? Also, we‚Äôve read that some people who recover from COVID end up with asthma flare-ups. The allergist says he‚Äôs not sure the canary was the cause. The Mrs. opined that she thinks that before having COVID the canary might not have set off the asthma. Can it be that once the lungs are agitated, they are more easily irritated until things settle down? I‚Äôm not sure how this all works."

"Hi everyone - I've had asthma for 20+ years, usually quite well managed. In early January I had a pretty significant flu. I was prescribed Montelukast to help with the cough, but it's been persisting for close to 5 weeks now.

I'm going to make a doctor appointment this week, but I thought I'd ask some fellow asthma sufferers **what worked for you in the past for kicking persistent mild coughs?** 

Currently my daily regimen includes a daily inhaled steroid, the Montelukast, and a rescue inhaler. I don't normally need the latter, but the last month I've used it almost daily. 

On top of that, since the flu in early January, if I don't keep my throat moist with warm liquids or a cough drop the cough gets progressively worse. Even with that, the cough persists, albeit mildly."
"In 2008 I went to China on a college trip and developed a bad viral infection after a rain event caused by cloud seeding. Over the course of a year, what began as bouts of manageable difficulty breathing at night became worse and I admitted myself to an emergency room after a particularly difficult night. I was diagnosed with asthma and sent home with albuterol and a steroid inhaler.

I saw an allergist and he told me I was allergic to just about everything. 

I discontinued use of the steroid inhaler. I continued to have difficulty breathing at night and needed to use my rescue inhaler 3-4x a week. I tried herbal remedies and acupuncture which helped to reduce reliance on inhaler.

I became pregnant in 2013 and my asthma disappeared for about 5 years. It came back after the birth of my second child and has gradually become worse. If I laugh too hard or cough, I immediately have to use my inhaler. Then I expectorate a thick glob of mucus. Lying down makes it worse.

I also have some weird circulatory problem that has become worse since the birth of my first child. Cold weather used to make my fingers very painful but now just holding an ice pop for my kids causes me pain. Eating ice cream makes my tongue hurt and causes me to cough. 

I have an appointment set up with a pulmonologist and I don‚Äôt know how relevant some of this information is and if I should omit certain aspects."

"Every time I walk in the cold for more than like 3 minutes, not only do I need my inhaler but my throat is itchy and voice is hoarse for like 30 min afterwards. Like to the point that it‚Äôs hard to talk for more than maybe thirty seconds without my throat getting so itchy I have to stop and clear my throat. Anyone else?"
"Is it normal for asthma to feel a bit worse after quitting smoking? I‚Äôve never had an asthma attack luckily, but I just feel like my throat is kinda tight and scratchy. And when I cough I wheeze"
"I‚Äôm a double vaxxed 18 year old with allergenic asthma that is controlled pretty good, I have a rescue inhaler and that‚Äôs it but I‚Äôm just wondering if I were to get Covid (I live on an island and basically the only variant going around is omicron) would I be alright or is it different for everyone?"
"Hello I‚Äôm new here, I‚Äôm 19 years old and developed severe asthma in the end of 2020. Most days I wake up ok but eventually I find myself struggling to breath for the rest of the day until I fall asleep. This has been happening to me since 2020 almost everyday. Albuterol only works about 40% of the time and same for the nebulizer. I haven‚Äôt been able to take a deep breath in probably a year. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs anxiety or what but I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. It‚Äôs putting so much stress on my body and idk what to do anymore. Any advice?"
"I tested positive for Covid and I‚Äôm having chest pain and shortness of breath (normal oxygen levels). Ventolin helps a bit with the sob, but chest pain is still around. What helped you when you had Covid?"
"Hi, I'm a 15 year male old athlete, and I've recently been diagnosed with breathlessness, and so I have been prescribed a seretide inhaler. For people who also have these, how long did it take to kick in, and how much did it open up your lungs?

Thanks a lot, I'm just looking forward to getting back to my sport. 

Have a great day."
"Hi! I am a 21f college athlete who was diagnosed with asthma at age 7 and lupus age 16. My asthma had been pretty well controlled until last February, when I got Covid and my lung function decreased by 60%. Since then, I‚Äôve been on singulair and Breo 1x day, Flovent and albuterol 2x day, and rescue with exercise. I‚Äôm back to full playing in my sport, but my lungs aren‚Äôt catching up like they need to so I will be starting Xolair. Has anyone had success with it? Hopefully I can get off of some inhalers once it kicks in!"
"I have cough variant asthma, and none of the doctors said I've been to are very familiar with it, and my treatments don't seem to work very well. Right now I'm on symbicort, singulair, and fluticasone, but I'm having a really bad flare up right now. Even when I'm not having a flare-up, I still don't feel great.

Does anyone have something that's worked for them?"
"Recently, I've started wondering if I have asthma due to a shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, and a fairly persistent cough. These symptoms worsen with activity, when lying down, and when going outside in the cold. My aunt thinks it's nothing ""you're only feeling these things because you're outside in the cold"" and ""I feel it too when I go outside"" but I think I actually might have a problem. I mean, I've wondered for years if I had asthma but never found out for sure because my mom was always like ""of course you don't have asthma"" and ""there's nothing wrong with you"".

This all started after my last bout of bronchitis back in October/November \[end of Oct, beginning of Nov\] and at first, I thought it was just a residual cough from said bronchitis but it's now February and it hasn't gone away. It's always gone away in the past - I used to get bronchitis frequently since childhood \[about 4-5 times a year until 7th grade, maybe 1-2 until 11th, and then after it was once every few years until 2015, then the most recent was in 2020\]. And on top of that cough is the other symptoms listed above in the first paragraph, which I think have started to worsen over the past month or so, but only very gradually.

I'm in the process of getting health insurance so I can see a doctor about this issue but until then, I was wondering if there was any insight as to whether or not I actually have asthma or any insight as to how I can ease the symptoms until I can see the doctor. Or, in any case, just general advice about whatever's going on with me.

Cough drops ease the coughing a bit, enough for me to be able to fall asleep, but they don't really work that well. I haven't tried cough syrup since I last had bronchitis and honestly, I'm not sure it would even help. but yeah, any ideas or advice?"
"My breathing is horrible everyday due to issues with GERD and LPR. I am having panic attacks cause of how sucky it feels to breathe. I have a reliever and nebulizer with ventolin (albuterol), and it kinda works, but it just comes back‚Ä¶

How good are corticosteroids for asthma/breathing issues? Should I look into them?

I‚Äôm living a nightmare right now"
"So I got COVID 6 weeks ago and it made my asthma flare up pretty bad, cough, shortness of breath- the whole shebang. 

I saw my doctor and she put me on 12 days of prednisone and Duoneb 3 times a day. I was feeling better until the steroids ran out and then the cough and shortness of breath came back.

I saw my doctor again and she put me on a shorter course of prednisone-8 days. I just finished it and I can tell the shortness of breath and cough are coming back. 

I already use a controller inhaler and my doctor said if I was still feeling bad, she was going to refer me to a pulmonologist. I plan on letting her know, but I‚Äôm curious what my next steps might be? I‚Äôve never had to take more than one course of prednisone, let alone two and not feel better afterwards, so this is foreign territory for me.

Any insight or ideas would be helpful! Thank you!"

"I'm a university student doing a project trying to redesign the pulse oximeter and have read some studies about oversaturation and undetected hypoxemia being more common in those with darker skin.

Hoping to know if anyone in the medical field or anyone who owns a pulse oximeter has noticed this phenomenon if you did it what did you do about it (if you could do anything), and how serious of a problem is this."
"Has anyone noticed veins becoming much more noticable while on asthma medication?

I have experienced a gradual increase in visibility of veins on my stomach, chest, face and legs the last couple of years. It's now so visible that it looks like I was struck by lightning while under proper light. For context, I have been on inhaled corticosteroids daily for most of my life. 

I have scheduled a consultation with my physician to reconsider my dose and/or discuss this phenomenon. I have heard this may be due to age (I am 24), but I have also read studies that suggest inhaled corticosteroids can induce thinning of the skin. 

Does anyone have experience with this?"
"I can't stop coughing today when I walk, laying down stops the coughing.

I developed asthma in 2021 and I take symbicort 200 right now, usually 2 puffs twice a day and PRN doses. I also am on singulair, cromolyn, and rupatidine.

I have trouble in buildings beside my home, especially commercial use buildings (hospitals, schools, offices, grocery stores, etc...)  because of the sanitizer.

Yesterday I was in a school all day for a course I tried getting through, I spent 6 hrs in there. I usually only do 30 mins in a store, I can't work because I constantly use my puffer as I work in hospital and I get terrible pain/migraines from the reactions.

I'm wondering if me coughing today is because I took the first part of the course yesterday.

I don't usually cough this much this long, and I took 4 puffs of my symbicort this AM.

Anyone had this happen with them?"

"There seem to be conflicting studies on this issue

In your personal experience, does consuming more or less salt help or hurt your asthma?"
My doctor has decided not to pursue looking into asthma. Are there conditions that mimic asthma? I realize there are a multitude of factors but reddit has been very helpful in the past so laying it out here. Also aren't there tests where they have you run on treadmills or stationary cycle to examine one's breathing?

I'm unsure if the heart racing and pain is from that or coughing too much but I feel like I'm going to die. Any advice? Do I not sleep and stay up? This is really terrible. I wanted to not use a Nebulizer as I told my Mom I didn't need it but she did not listen. It can either be from the Albuterol or its because I coughed too much because of my mucus I had in my mouth this week. I coughed like 70 times or more daily. And had very bad pose nasil drip. The pose nasil drip is gone now because I took other medication my Mom gave me. So does anyone know what's going on with me? I'm scared.
"Hi, first time here. 

Around the end of 2021, my spouse‚Äôs asthma, which isn‚Äôt well controlled generally, started acting up, which typically happens in winter. We got a prescription for QVar Redihaler, which worked in the past, but due to pricing and paperwork involving an online pharmacy in another country, it took weeks to finally get the order approved and shipped. (Got the shipment email a couple days ago but could take weeks to arrive.)

Anyway, spouse‚Äôs asthma continued getting worse to where they had to stop playing RingFit, most activity left them out of breath, and their voice turned hoarse. They started using their albuterol sulfate inhaler multiple times a day and it barely helped. Around mid-January they had a day where just sitting upright made them feel lightheaded. We went to urgent care, they were diagnosed with bronchitis after an x-ray, and they were sent home with steroids and antibiotics.

About a week later they were finally feeling recovered and returned to normal activity, even though the QVar was still stuck in paperwork limbo at the time. Fast forward to now, they‚Äôre feeling easily out of breath again and all the same symptoms except for the lightheadedness while sitting.

We really don‚Äôt want to go to urgent care again if it‚Äôs diagnosed as bronchitis like last time and the treatment doesn‚Äôt really work‚Ä¶ plus our HSA is depleted and we really need to save money since we might be moving this month. Has anyone had an experience like this before, and what besides maintenance inhalers helped you in the meantime? I got an extra humidifier for their home office, but idk how much good that‚Äôll do‚Ä¶"

"There was a small flurry of articles in 2018 and 2020 about the possibility of inhales cacilytics as a very promising controller inhaled medication that had at least as good if not better results than ICS, with few if any known side effects, that could target airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation at a more fundamental cellular level.

It's been radio silence since. These drugs were already shown to be safe in the oral route for trials osteoporosis (they just turned out not to work for that condition) so I'm surprised I can't find any human clinical trials by now. Anyone here of anything recent?"


"I will have weeks where I‚Äôm completely symptom free, and then others where I need to use my inhalers all the time.  Is this normal??  How can I figure out what‚Äôs causing these flair ups as there seems to be no real pattern to it?"
"Hi yall! I'm currently running out of a maintenance inhaler in about two weeks. I was previously getting my prescription from the pulmonologist I was seeing but they're now out-of-network with my insurance (and I kinda wanted to stop seeing them anyway). What other doctors can prescribe maintenance inhalers? I need to see an allergist and PCP anyway, so would I be able to get a script from them?"
Anybody else feels/felt that? It‚Äôs so weird
"I couldn't find any posts about this on reddit. Anyone here with perimenstrual asthma? I have been having occasional exercise induced difficulty of breathing, and I have now noticed that they are timed right before I ovulate. Google revealed that I am not the only one, and the term for this is perimenstrual asthma. I have some asthma related tests booked in the next month, after which I'll be able to discuss with my doctor. But I would be interested to hear if there are others here with some experience about it!"
"I literally can't escape this asthma, I live in a house heated by wood(which im allergic to), I work with chemicals all day, and my wife is pregnant so she isn't able to help clean as much as before. 

My doctor put me on some generic for singulair and my regular inhaler but it's not working. I need a strong sir purifier, thank you in advance!"
"I had prehypertension prior to taking Symbicort. I have taken it for about 3 years now, the low dose, and blood pressure has elevated slowly. 

Has anyone else had this issue and did you switch medicines?  If so, did blood pressure come down?"
"I (22M) have had asthma since I was a little child. I take Seretide twice a day + Ventolin when I need it (not very often). 

My fitness is pretty bad, which is why I want to start an exercise routine so badly. I've tried doing that multiple times in the last few years (usually swimming, which I quite enjoy). However, the problem is that I always end up getting sick with the common cold after a few weeks of regular exercise. Normally I'd get the common cold pretty often (every 2-3- maybe 4 months), but exercise seems to exacerbate it.

I feel like I need to exercise regularly to improve my immune system, but can't because my immune system is so bad. So I feel like I'm stuck in an endless loop of unsatisfaction.

Please let me know if you have any experience with this."

"I (17F) had just finished waking about 1km I reached the office (the ac was on), sat down and started to feel very out of breath. Everytime I took a breath it was all whispy (kinda like an old person dying) and I was wheezing and found it really hard to talk. I tried to breather but I felt there was no side going inside me (I was wearing a mask btw). It was so hard to breather and my chest was painful. I‚Äôm not sure if this was a mini asthma attack or if my chest was just a little tight. My terrible breathing persisted for about half an hour then went away. 
I only get breathing issues when I have a cold and right after I got covid I started having breathing issues by doing simple tasks (walking up the stairs, sweeping, giving the dogs food)."

"First time posting in the group and really just curious.  This doesn't happen every time I work out, but sometimes, when I push it to where it sort of hurts a bit to breath (Ive always assumed this was not an asthma-related symptom, just an exercise one), for the next 2 to 3 days afterwards, even with inhaler and daily steroids, I'm short of breath and feel (there's no other way to describe this) like my lungs are swollen and taking up more space in my body.I wheeze more and just generally feel like I'm not getting the oxygen I need. My SpO2 is fine, but it feels like I have to take deep breaths every once in a while, which then leads me to feeling like I'm hyperventilating. My back under my shoulder blades gets super sore.   Then, after a few days it goes away. I've grown up with asthma my whole life but this is a new thing - can a hard workout trigger *days* of symptoms like this?  Anybody else get this shit? TIA

PS - could i be in better shape? definitely, but I'm not *that* out of shape either."
"I'm 21, never had asthma symptoms as a kid. Suddenly i had these two breathing issues that came out of nowhere


The first time I breathed something down the wrong pipe. I have anxiety over coughing, so i was worried. But then suddenly, i lost the ability to breath completely. I couldn't even try to breath. It was like my airway was completely gone. That lasted for maybe 10 seconds, then i just could breath again just fine.


Then, a few months later, i had this conversation with someone. I was nervous/caught off guard and then suddenly i wasn't able to breathe well, like i kept coughing and breathing short. I lied and said i breathed in saliva, but it wasn't actually that.


Does this sound like asthma? I've only had the two occurrences"
I‚Äôve been on advair for over 20 years and I think I‚Äôm developing avascular necrosis in my hips from long term steroid use. Anyone else developing symptoms from long term use?
"I have noteiced a significant smoke odor since I changed my radiators (heating) for heating throghout the air duct which connects with the central vent ducts of the building. I noticed the neighbor smoke comes up through the duct and expands at my home, specially when we have the heating on.

 It's really annoying to me as tobacco is prohibited at my place bc of my asthma but the smell of the neighbor is noticable. 
Do you know any solution for this? Some kind of filter? I have read that HEPA filters don't work for smell and smoke.

Where I live we don't have ""community rules"" regarding what you can do at your home so trying to convince the neighbor not to smoke is not an option, plus they are nice neighbors so I dont wanna create an unnecessary akward situation."

"Hello, if you've seen a TCM doc/received acupuncture in the US recently, I'd love to speak with you for a school project! This can be totally anonymous. I'd only need 15mins of your time, but unfortunately I cannot offer any compensation since this is for school :(

Thanks in advance for any help you're able to provide!"
"I have a long term asthma going on and it's hard to stop. Erythromycin got me feeling nauseous and bloated even though I haven't eaten anything yet. I also feel something (not pain, it's like the feeling of having to throw up?)  on my upper abdomen, somewhere between the ribs."
"it felt like cold symptoms i took a covid test . came out negative . I was experiencing really bad sinus pain and an on going cough for 2 days . for the first day while lying down it was easily triggered, 2nd day just doing regular chores would trigger shortness of breath wheezing and coughing and id have to use my inhaler like 5x a day in order to feel better . today i am feeling a lot better but im scared the symptoms will come back , and im always anxious when stuff like this happens ."
"ive only really used ventolin and asmol in the 10 years or so ive had asthma. however at the chemist the other day, i was given zempreon. i used it today for the first time abt 30 minutes ago and since them my hands have been shaking quite a bit. i am not sure if its related to the zempreon or not. ive only had shaky hands from asthma meds when i have used too much but i only did 4 puffs of this.

its plausible my hands are shaky for other reasons but nothing else has been different today besides the medication i used. 

so, are they different in any way ? is it possible zempreon will give me side affects the others dont ?"
"Not diagnosed with asthma yet. Had multiple PFT spirometry and theyve been normal. Peak flow is always normal as well.

Many strong smells, soaps, detergent, deodorant, perfumes. Make my upper throat irritated and make me cough.  I noticed the smell of my armpits doing it as well. Like the smell of when i dont wear deodorant and i sweat. Thats probably my worst trigger.

I do have really bad GERD as well as vocal cord dysfunction VCD seen by ENT doctor.

When i smell these things I feel like im wheezing, but the wheeze is when i breathe in and in my upper throat, not chest. The doctors that have listened to my lungs dont hear anything. I always check peak flow during these episodes and its always normal. I also dont feel short of breath at all. 

3 PFTs have been normal as well.

Any ideas? Are these smells making my VCD worse? Allergy skin testing was all negative. Blood testing showed a couple mold and mite allergies but thats it."
"That is all.

Actually, main issue is men's deodorant for my partner."
I (19M) had my first ever asthma attack yesterday when I was going to work. I had to borrow an inhaler from another person and then went to the hospital where the doctor prespiced me a rescue inhaler since before then the asthma had only been exercise induced. When i woke up I had an asthma attack so I took 10 puffs of the inhaler which didn't help much. and as I was working I took more puffs which still didn't help much. My windpipe is mostly open now after 3 hours of being breathless  but I still hear wheezing. Should I see a doctor about this?
"Hi, so I‚Äôm a middle and highschool teacher (24F). I‚Äôve had asthma for years, been using Symbicort twice a day for over a year since re-diagnosing in late 2020. My triggers are exercise, dust and pollen. Strenuous exercise is the worst and bring about the bigger attacks. Other than this burden, I‚Äôm healthy.

So my job requires me to talk a lot, sometimes I have to talk over middle schoolers talking too.

What my problem is that sometimes I get way too winded when talking in class. When it happened the first time, I left the room for a few minutes to breathe in the hall. Those we 12 grade students and they understood. After that time whenever I am out of breath during class I usually push through and just continue talking while just taking larger breaths between words. The feeling is not nice, like someone is sitting on my chest. As per usual

Should I continue pushing through? Should I excuse myself from the class anytime it happens? One of the main parts of my job is to talk. If I can‚Äôt do that comfortably, what then?
Thoughts on the situation?"
"I'm a retired RN and have extensive experience with nebulizers, but not home nebulizers. I have decided to keep budesonide at home should I get Covid. (No politics, please. I'm an old woman raising 2 young children by myself and if I go to the hospital, they may end up with CPS. I have no family in the area.)

I thought I should ask the experts - the people at r/asthma \- what nebulizer to buy. I don't want to spend a ton, but I want it to deliver the medicine adequately should I need it.

Thanks. 

P.S. In reading through the posts, I'm impressed by the upbeat nature of this subreddit. It's great!"
"Hey, new lurker round here, had asthma for yonks. 

Any time I get a cold it goes it my chest and I end up on steroid tablets. Does anyone else get a weird, pulsating, pressure feeling in their spine with the steroids? Like I'll go from standing to sitting down and a few seconds later my back is throbbing for maybe 30 seconds and it eases up. 

I never see anything about it in the patient medical leaflet so am wondering if it's a common thing or not? Thanks üòä"
"My 17 year old daughter has been feeling out of breath and unwell for a few months and we were recently told she may have asthma. She took a 5 day course of steroid tablets which did improve her breathing (its no longer wheezy).

We were told to measure her breathing on a peak monitor once she had finished the steroids which we have done and its always between 200-250 at best. 

We submitted the readings to the gp as requested and they have asked to see her back as these are too low for her age?. 

She is breathing a lot better than she was but is still having to breathe quite heavily when walking etc. 

She is 17 and 5 foot 5.

Has anyone had results like this after starting medication ? Is it possible thats just her norm? Our doctor seemed to say it was too far away from what was expected to be a normal variation?"
"Hello everyone, I have asthma and had used emergency and steroid inhalers for years, I no longer need them (obviously this won't be the case for everyone) after I started 2 breathing practices. I start every day with the wim hof method which scientifically is proven to reduce inflammation, inprove immune system, and improve v02 max, and I practice oxygen advantage throughout the day. Combine both of those and it helps with every aspect of lungs and breathing that asthma inhibit (oxygen advantage is about learning to only breathe through the nose, and improves your ability to handle co2 so you can breath much less and more controlled) definitely recommend them both to everyone, oxygen advantage has a book teaching it you can get for free on pdfdrive, and wim hof method you can either buy the courses which is what I did and prefer (it goes much more in depth and teaches breathing techniques to help with specific things like inflammation, stress, energy etc) or you can just learn the wim hof method on YouTube because all the basics needed to do the method are free on YouTube. Let me know what yall think and if it helps!"
"Ever since I was younger I used to get a tightened chest and wheezing every time I got a cold (I was sick every 2 months probably) and I was start wheezing and coughing if a I ran a little. I grew out of it, got sick less often, and only got the right chest and wheezing when I was sick. I got covid in around end of November and just recently (for about 3weeks now) I‚Äôve been getting the right chest and wheezing more often (eg in the gym, going up the stairs, at night before bed) and I‚Äôm wondering if maybe Covid brought my asthma back, was it even asthma. My mum never gave me a pump because she didn‚Äôt want me to rely on it."
I know your not meant to take it but i do because I get allot of muscle tension in my neck. Don‚Äôt think i have ever had a asthma attack from taking it tho.
I take ibroprofen but I know your not meant to. What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs take on it?
"Hey guys, I was just at the doctors office . My spirometry was pretty bad and doctor decided that I had asthma but probably silent one ( i never cough or wheeze or anything like that . I am a basketball player also, 0 problems running) . 

Thing is , I forgot to mention to my doctor that I had hiatal hernia. And it makes my life a living hell , because I often feel like I cant breathe in properly . 
Do you guys thing my hernia could've messed up my spirometry resaults ? Because I wouldn't want to start Symbicort if there is any chance of me not actually having asthma ."

"Hi all,

I've tried the search function across Reddit, haven't gotten much luck. 

Background: 1000lb club; runs 25mi/wk; eat consistent and clean everyday, no junk at all; US Soldier

Whenever I run specifically, by around ~.4mi my lungs start tightening and breathing becomes difficult...I've been consistently training at high levels for the past 6 years, and now this has recently hit me.

I did a 10mi ruck on Saturday, totally fine; then Sunday night I was having some difficulty breathing (felt heavy) when going to sleep which lasted through Monday when lifting, mild breathing. Tuesday, it went away totally except for when lifting, and today (Wed) I went to run and could barely put in a half mile on the first shot. I had to run multiple broken miles with 15min rest between each, and I kept purposefully coughing/clearing my throat to hopefully clear something out? Felt like poor bloodflow to extremities and half-capacity lungs. I also had some weird hives bump breakout today too, never happened before because I'm used to cold weather running. 

I feel 100% totally fine otherwise; I had covid 2mo ago with zero symptoms so I strongly doubt it's that (and vaxxed). I'm currently deployed in the middle east, air quality blows...only seasonal allergies back home to pollen, but been abolutely fine here for the last 8mo.

Any help?? Thanks!"

"* chest tightness
* main symptom - throat tightness
* occasional sneezing 
* fast heartbeat

seen my oxygen level drop once or twice when i running at night 

what i used to do when i felt bad i would try to burp to make myself feel better i didn't always work  but i assumed it was acid reflux-example as  kid I would drink a lot of soda then later on i would randomly struggle to breath so i would burp to see if it would help

the reason why I'm questioning this  cause one time i felt bad(chest tightness pain  and my throat keep making a raspy noise  when i would laugh and inhale  i decided to go to the er the  top nurse yelled at me and said i should start taking panic attacks meds- gave me script for Ativan

so when  a doc would say its panic attacks- they would tell me to try to calm myself down at home so i tried  ,but during one of my  episodes the anxiety meds weren't working no matter how much i tried to calm myself  and get better  nothing would work the episode lasted hours 

&amp;#x200B;

two urgent care docs -say asthma  =primary says panic attacks  ER says anxiety

so i'm just confused"

[removed]
I‚Äôve been needing to use my inhaler several times a week and I‚Äôm down to one last dose. I don‚Äôt have insurance right now or any money period. Can I go to the emergency room to get one? Should I? Is there an over the counter solution? I can‚Äôt not have one. Surely others must have been in this situation.
"Hi! I recently came here due to my asthma symptoms getting much and worse and much more noticeable as of recent. More difficulty breathing. It acts up in the cold, around smokes and certain chemicals and when I exercise, even if slightly.

However, despite being prescribed an inhaler, and my family not being money tight, my Dad still tells me he doesn't think I need the inhaler and that he doesn't know when he's going to get it because he doesn't want to over-medicate me (I have Tourettes and CPTSD, and with that anti-depressants and tic medicine) despite the doctor saying I have asthma. He thinks I'm simply out of shape, despite it acting up when I'm not exercising as well.

Since my asthma has been getting progressively worse and this is what brought it to my attention, I am very afraid of it getting life threatening. It's basically been established that my Dad is not going to get me an inhaler any time soon, and so I'm just.... scared. He has been very resistant when I need things in the past, but now I fear for my life.

What should I do?"
"Mine does not have a counter thing on it. How do I know it's out? One time I kept using it even though it tasted like some sort of burning scent. My pharmacist later told me it was out, but I don't think the other canisters had that taste. Is there a good way to know if it's running low or out?"
I think it could be because of random temperature changes and rainy weather ugh I hate it.
"My Primary care doctor prescribed an Albuterol Sulfate inhaler for me to use daily.

I have very mild asthma that really only bothers me when I have a cold or flue. Or active in very cold air.

I‚Äôm thinking a preventer inhaler.

Am I confused? Or should I talk to her about it?

Thanks in advance for you thoughts."
"I don't get the flu very often, but every couple years or so, here it comes. I'm done with this episode. Only took 7 days to kick it, but clearing my lungs from the aftermath, is irritating. What it says to me, is my body put up a whale of a fight. 

Any tips to break up the mucous faster? So far, I have:

Inhaled steam (works decently).
Eaten megadoses of vit c.
Inhaled fresh air.
Ridden my bicycle (higher amts of oxy).
Slept propped up (didn't work AT all)."
"Hi everyone,

I normally wouldn‚Äôt come here to post but dont know who else to ask. I am a 34 year old male and I have had minor asthma my entire life. Over the last 10 years or so, I have had a strange cough about once a month from my chest, coughing up dark green blobs for most of the day. I have been to the doc many times, and generally he chalks it up to a sinus infection and gives me antibiotics, which helps, but it always comes back. No other symptoms that I am aware of.

Has anyone had a similar experience? I want to get to the root of this as opposed to just treating it with antibiotics. I am not sure if it is related to the asthma but figured i would start here. I have an appt scheduled with a new pulmonologist to see if he has any ideas.

Thank you all."
"Hello! I‚Äôm 22F, I‚Äôve had some strange symptoms of I have no idea what and currently I‚Äôm on a work trip to another city, so I‚Äôll be able to see a doctor only in 10 days, but I‚Äôm very worried 


I‚Äôm very prone to respiratory infections, but last time I was ill was in October, I haven‚Äôt had covid/ flu/ common cold ever since. It started 2 weeks ago, I‚Äôve had a very weird feeling in my chest, like something is itching and tickling, making me want to cough (dry unproductive cough), it‚Äôs easy to suppress it, but it‚Äôs very annoying. No pain, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes and temperature, just tickling deep inside my chest (like inside the solar plexus). It gets worse at night, when I‚Äôm lying on my back, it feels like my upper back hurts and it‚Äôs difficult to breath, I can also ‚Äúhear‚Äù myself breathing if I‚Äôm lying on the back. Also, I‚Äôve been experiencing shortness of breath, especially if Im walking fast, and rapid heartbeat. When I‚Äôm making a deep breath, I‚Äôm feeling this itching inside my neck and like in the center of the chest. Don‚Äôt know if it matters, but before it had began, I got red flacky spots on my face, close to eyelids, nose and lips. Sometimes it‚Äôs seems like they almost disappear, but then they come out again.


Never had this before, so I‚Äôm concerned what could it be. Not asking for a diagnose, just wondering if it sounds like the onset of asthma"

"And of course the usual answer would be to order another, but i‚Äôm very stuck for money and because I work, I pay for my prescriptions. Is there anything that helps with a very slight tight chest?"
"Hello! 

I've had moderate asthma my whole life.  I take a preventative puffer as well as I have my emergency puffer on hand.

I just tested positive for COVID a few days ago, and had a bad attack last night.  I took my emergency puffer and it eventually calmed down.  

  Those of you with asthma who have had COVID, did you take anything other than your normal puffers to try to prevent asthma attacks?  I'm double vaccinated. 

I have a phone appointment with my doctor booked for tomorrow, but I'm just looking for personal recommendations as well."


"originally diagnosed with moderate uncontrolled asthma , my symptoms have been very well controlled last fee years . last flare up was about 7 months ago and took a while to recover and now im experiencing the same symptoms as i was previously before diagnosis. i have a long list of allergies as well and i believe new seasonal allergies so im not sure if thats causing this to happen .  i am sneezing so i am sure it is allergy related , i am taking flovant and i do have a nebulizer if things get out of control as well . has this happened to anyone ?"
"Pretty sure I have acute bronchitis again, I was hospitalized last February for the same thing. I tested negative for covid twice, after coming in contact with a symptomatic friend. I'm on day three of the sickness and the shortness of breath and back tightness has kicked in. I was on a steroid regimen last time I had this. I had a steroid shot in the summer for asthma exacerbations. Then this past December I got a respiratory virus from work and ended up needing steroids again. It's barely over a month since I've been off steroids and I'm getting my ass kicked again. I'm monitoring my symptoms at home and hoping it doesn't get bad enough to need to go the ER again. I take a daily steroid inhaler and singulair, I don't understand why I've declined so much the past few years. Has anyone else made it out on the other side of this? I feel like it's all downhill from here and I'm in my mid 20s. I'm in the middle of my semester at college and feel like I'm falling behind because of this. Just wanted to vent somewhere, don't have many people around let alone those that understand asthma. Would appreciate any response."
"I feel much more relaxed and feel like I can breath a bit easier, but I‚Äôve read that it can flare up asthma or suppress breathing but I‚Äôve never really had any of that even with heavy drinking."
"I wish I was joking.

Soooo after almost two whole years of not getting COVID, I caught it - unclear whether it came from work as there were some kids running around and coughing everywhere not covering their mouths, or whether it came from university (as the university doesn't make their case numbers easy to view!). At first it got picked up on an LFT and I was \*largely\* symptom free apart from being tired and sore chest (which I had honestly thought was just a normal bit of strain), but the symptoms ramped up the following day, getting worse until I was unfortunately told after calling 111 for a red-zone PF than an ambulance was dispatched to me after being just above red since Friday. Naturally I assumed if 111 were telling me ""bruh this is bad"" that I would get proper care when I went to hospital especially as I've had enough asthma problems to be classed as ""extremely clinically vulnerable"", was IN TEARS from the pain in my chest, and my inhaler wasn't working for me but noooo. 

The ambulance crew were very nice and calming considering the circumstances - my heart rate was hitting 150 which I normally only hit after sprinting. The nurse who stole my blood (and actually did the butterfly needle as painlessly as possible, kudos!) and did my ECG was also really nice, and explained that I also had low blood pressure which they almost kept me in for and would explain why the world has tilted and I've felt faint whenever I've stood up. She then said I would have to go for a chest x-ray which was ""standard for anyone brought in with COVID"" and I was having pain which was inducing tears even with codeine and paracetamol (I can't have NSAIDs like ibuprofen). When I finally got seen by a doctor though, who was apparently the only person who could authorise a chest x-ray, he didn't listen to me at all and was incredibly dismissive. He then told me I was ""wasting time"" if I was getting a chest x-ray because - and I quote - ""the ones from October 2020, when you came in for an asthma attack, look great, so I don't see the point"".

Sir, circumstance hath changed. Quite a lot since then!

He then told me I had ""textbook pleurisy"" but ""young people often don't feel it so badly, so not much point doing anything about it""

I couldn't believe it. He also told me that he didn't believe I could be ""in that much pain and feeling that unwell"" because ""young people don't feel COVID so badly, you're only 20"" - a 20-year-old who is clinically extremely vulnerable after 5 attacks in 18 months and a resus admission in November. I wasn't given any pain medicine or fluids despite shaking, being in tears from pain and feeling physically very unwell/nauseous - my iron was low on my blood work and he told me I should eat more meat, even after I explained I'm vegan due to a dairy allergy. He dismissed the pain which had kept me up for more than a day with a wave of his hand and I walked half a mile home in the dark which took me about 45 minutes stopping-and-starting (nobody in my house could have picked me up as they're all negative and I'm the only one who drives in our house) when it normally only takes me 15. I felt that I had been gaslit because of my age and my sex (I'm trans but my sex assigned at birth is female and doctors have a habit of insisting to my face I'm just a ""confused little girl"") as he seemed to insist I was wasting time.

Have any other young asthmatics been gaslighted and ignored like this? I feel so let down by the very service which insisted on taking me there."


"I just moved from California to Colorado, and in both states it has been impossible for me to refill my Dulera prescription due to being on backorder from the manufacturer. 

I googled it and couldn't find anything on the FDA drug shortages database about this drug being in short supply in the US. 

Anyone else experiencing difficulty getting their Dulera prescription filled? Trying to figure out what I can do in the meantime since this is the only inhaler that has worked for me (tried 4 inhalers before one worked)."
"Given the office last two weeks did next to no distancing, no wfh for teams that could and just ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt wanna‚Äùand my boss was roaming friday with symptoms that i didn‚Äôt notice till end of day, ( i normally mask at the office but it was just the three of us on friday, and lo)‚Ä¶

I mistook the symptoms for asthma reacting to the weather, and biked 8km. and no headache or weird other symptoms so i almost missed it when the rapid test popped up with the positive. 

I have really well controlled asthma, but damn if I‚Äôm not trying to hide the freakout right now. Me and viruses don‚Äôt tango well here."

Hi all! So I‚Äôve had asthma for decades (I‚Äôm 44). It was controlled for years by advair 250 and my albuterol inhaler (that I rarely used). Then all of a sudden about a year ago it got bad. I got some meds for my nebulizer and was upped to 500 advair. Well it‚Äôs never really gotten better. I haven‚Äôt had to use my nebulizer but I use my rescue inhaler several times a day and am still on advair 500. Has this happened to anyone? What do you think it could be? I also have some occasional coughing but I can literally go weeks without coughing. I am not a smoker currently. I quit over a decade ago. Thank you!
"My bf has been struggling to breath for months now. He resigned at his job back in September so we could move across country. He tried to get a refill from his doctor before we left but they would not see him without insurance, and it was ""too early"" for him to get a refill. He's used up his Albuterol few months ago and has been using a rescue and also his nebulizer machine, and now he has less than a few days on either of them and I didnt know, he didn't want to worry me. He has severe asthma and when insuranced he'd use his inhaler every day or every other.

He landed a job a month ago (job market is ridiculous right now) but he still has 60 days till insurance will kick in. Can somebody please help us?? Where can we get Albuterol without insurance and not a huge chunk of money? We're already in debt. His rescue inhaler and nebuilzer machine have barely been helping since he's been off his medicine for so long, he needs the Albuterol, he's so wheezy."
"i was diagnosed with asthma when i was 10 or so, but it pretty much went away when i was 11. i've spent the last 10 years with no asthma symptoms or attacks. but back in november/december 2021 i contracted the flu (flu A to be precise) and it was pretty bad for me. i got over it after about 2-3 weeks, but ever since then i've had a weekly-biweekly recurrent cough. and every night, usually around 2 AM, i start to wheeze and have labored breathing. could the flu have brought back my asthma?"


"Hey, new to the sub and asthma in general. This post is not for me but for my girlfriend.

She's been having asthma for some time now but it was never such a big issue up until now. We left our home for a while, came back and realized how bad it triggers her asthma.

I've read online and know that the basics are to keep a clean environment, wash textiles in hot water to get rid of dust and dust mites and so on.

Are there any products that can help with keeping a clean house ? Talking about hand held mini vacuums and the such.

I've seen stuff like like purifiers and many other products but I have no idea which would actually be helpful for someone with asthma.

Thanks in advance !"

"My pulmonologist diagnosed me with RAD and gave me Singulair. It helps a lot with my baseline breathing as well as EIB.

After my diagnosis, I've noticed some of my symptoms for what they really are, instead of writing it off as a fluke. I realized I have significant bronchoconstriction when I wake up from naps. (I'm fine when I wake up in the morning, so I don't think it's related to my bed or linens.) It interferes with my day because I can't go exercise after my nap.

I've only been on Singulair for 3 days. When should I ask my doctor about a rescue inhaler? (I don't take naps often.) I'm actually struggling to breathe as I type... I have half a mind to pick up Primatene mist at the pharmacy."
"I have moderate eosinophilic asthma. I take my daily inhaler and also have ventolin as a rescue inhaler. Sometimes, especially after being sick, I get this weird dyspnea symptoms:
Feeling of not getting enough air, the need to inhale deeply until it feels ‚Äúdeep‚Äù enough. I also get chest pain and sometimes a bit of white phlegm. Ventolin does not help all the time, so I was given prednisone. After taking it for a week, the symptoms disappeared, but it took a whole week(except the phlegm). Now, almost a month later, I am having the same episodes (right now they seem to be disappearing slowly. I‚Äôm not on prednisone). 

Anyone else has or had these weird episodes? 
To rule out anxiety induced dyspnea I was given Temesta, which did not stop it at all, so my doctor does not think it‚Äôs anxiety related (besides I am pretty relaxed and no major life changed occured)"
"So far I've not needed to use an inhaler but recently I've been having a suffocating feeling kind of like I need to breathe in and inhale sharply in order to get a deep breath. It feels like air is having difficulty passing through my airway. I also noticed at night I have trouble breathing on my back as air seems to have trouble going through my airway. This is not noticeable during side sleeping. 

Are these all symptoms of asthma? Also, air there any specific tests aside from spirometry that can test the health or functionality of the upper airway near the throat area?"
"Hey everyone - i wrote on here about 2 months ago about a pretty intense asthma attack that landed me in the ER. Since then, i have had one more ER trip after my asthma was set off by running in very cold weather. I am on Singulair, Advair 500/50, did a solid round of prednisone (tapered off), and use my rescue inhaler / nebulizer on an as-needed basis. I certainly feel better than i did during those days before an after each attack, but i still don‚Äôt feel like i have reached my baseline normal. Im starting to think it‚Äôs in my head! I‚Äôm 25F and a fairly active runner, though i can barely make it two miles on a good day, and some days can‚Äôt exercise at all. I have coughing fits when trying to run and occasionally during the day, and I occasionally wake up at night with wheezing so intense that i get scared! I don‚Äôt suffer from allergies (that I know of) though my pulmonologist ordered some tests to check for different sources of asthma. I got my bloods taken and my IgE level came back at 3 kU/L, and my absolute eosinophils came back at 102, with a percentage of 1.5%. Does anyone know if this is a normal IgE level? Would my eosinophils possibly be higher if i were not on advair / got of prednisone 2ish weeks ago? Thanks for your help!"
"Hi all, I'd really welcome people's opinion on this - basically I'm trying not to consult Dr Google as the last time it diagnosed any number of sinister terminal illnesses and scared the life out of me!

Used to have what I thought was asthma many, many years ago into my early 30's. But then it cleared up completely for no apparent reason. For no apparent reason over recent months it's suddenly revisited with a vengeance. 

I've got the signature tight chest but do any of you have really horrible (sorry about this...!) really green thick phlegm they're coughing up mainly in the morning? 

My GP seems to think it's asthma, but for me it seems more like an infection which antibiotics haven't resolved. However, out of say 5,000 NHS surgeries, our surgery is literally something like 4,800 at the bottom of the league table, so I really don't trust what they're telling me or know where else to turn - I have recently had a lot of digestive / LPR/ GERD issues so could that be the issue? 

I'd really welcome anyone's thoughts on this - many thanks advance."
Does anyone know if it‚Äôs okay to take Zyrtec while taking advair? May seem like a dumb question but was just curious.
"My girlfriend (26F) and I recently moved from the suburbs surrounded by nature to the downtown of a large city filled with dust. She's having a lot of trouble with her asthma, especially in these winter months. She never had much of an issue with asthma until recently so we're both relatively new to the subject. Aside from constant cleaning, carrying an inhaler, and having a nebulizer at our place, are there any tips you all have? Thank you in advance!"
"Hi guys !  
I got diagnosed about 3 years ago, at 20.  
I only ever had 1 flare up (coughing, wheezing, felt that I was suffocating), doctors just see me to keep giving me the meds, but I started to gradually reduce them to see if I still need them. My spirometry looks normal, dont notice anything weird, do exercise without problem so I have a very mild form from what I can gather. I take 1 dose of Fostair inhaler about every 5 days ""just to be safe"" (not bc of any  symptom).  
My question is - is it possible to ""outgrow"" asthma if I have this mild of a form ?"
"Normally around 570, been around 430ish. I've upped the dose on my fostair. Been painting as well. Anything else I can do/ need to be watching for?"
"During research to improve my symptoms of fatigue, unrefreshing sleep and poor concentration I came across research showing relations between OSAS (sleep apnea) and Asthma. Since I have a diagnosis for both, and currently use both CPAP and corticosteroids, I feel kind of lost on what an optimal treatment would (or could) be. Articles suggest both that corticosteroids could help, and could make it worse. I wonder if anyone here has experience with the combination of these two, and is able to shine a light on possible treatment methods/improvements. CPAP is slightly helping, and over the last decade I've tried dozens of things without proper success. Open for suggestions and discussions.

"shortness of breath and feeling you cannot breath in almost at all , wet cough and weezing ? and eventually the cough becomes more persistent ?  i never had this as bad as it is recently so im wondering if others experience this as well ."

"I think I‚Äôm just desperate to figure out how I got asthma. No one in my family has it and I try not to discuss it with them because I know they‚Äôll just worry. I‚Äôll try to keep this as short as possible and would really appreciate any advice or information you may have. For reference I‚Äôm a 26 year old female and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at a young age. Never had any allergies until like 5 years ago which just progressively got worse. Now I have to take Allegra every day. I also take bupropion every day. 

-I remember in November of 2019 I got sick with some virus (not covid) that lasted about 3 days. I got better. Moved on. But I had a sniffle that never really went away.

-fast forward a few weeks and the sniffle turned into a cough. Nothing too bothersome and I didn‚Äôt think much of it. 

-January 2019, I was in the best shape of my life. I had been going to the gym and exercising consistently. One day I‚Äôm just walking on the treadmill at the gym and out of nowhere I experience a really bad coughing fit that prevented me from even talking. Could not stop coughing.

-Tell my doctor and he says its exercise induced asthma. Gives me an inhaler.

-that cough I had going on for a while turned into a productive cough with a lot of mucus (TMI I‚Äôm sorry). I experienced no asthma but this cough was a daily problem for me. Especially at night. 

-I was examined by an ENT and he said everything looked normal. Gave me singulair for my productive cough 

-I pretty much stopped exercising because I would have trouble breathing.

-Then February of 2020 I experienced a very bad flare up of asthma likely because the weather was very cold. I was also going through a rough time emotionally and had a lot of bottled up anger which made it worse. I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly for 6 days and inhaler wasn‚Äôt helping.

-landed in the hospital and was given tons of steroids.

So here I am now almost exactly a year later with another asthma flare. Taking my medication when I have to‚Ä¶but man I hate these steroids and I‚Äôm so desperate for a healthier alternative. I‚Äôve even started going to acupuncture.

To make things even weirder I had an allergy test done which showed I had no significant allergies..to anything.

I‚Äôm so frustrated. I just want to vent to people who understand. I‚Äôm sorry for the long post. Is there any hope or am I just forced to use these steroids for the rest of my life"

"I‚Äôm in the process of getting my asthma controlled again. I caught a small cold and it turned into full blown asthma bronchitis. I‚Äôm wheezing so bad I have to sleep in the recliner chair in the living room. My upper back has a knife shooting pain in it every time I breathe. I‚Äôm so weak I can barely open things. My head is killing me from this cough. All I do it cough and cough. My throat hurts from coughing so hard. I almost puke from coughing so hard. And I have no energy. I feel like I just need to sleep and sleep and sleep. But I can‚Äôt. I have kids and a husband and a business we run. I am so tired! I can‚Äôt cook, clean, or work.  I asked the doctor for prednisone today. My inhalers, nebulizer, cough drops, hot tea, steamy showers, and IBUPROFEN aren‚Äôt working. Anything else y‚Äôall do that can help me get up and going again while I wait for my prednisone? Thank you my asthma friends!"
"hi everyone.

so two days ago, in the morning i noticed i had a low grade fever, but otherwise felt fine. i have some autoimmune diseases so that isn't too out of the ordinary for me but i decided to test for covid. i did an at home rapid test on myself (neg) and then went out and got a PCR. later into the day my fever soared to 102.1 and i was in so much pain. excruciating joint pain, migraine, chest pain (the kind that i get from running sometimes, it wasn't too alarming though it has never happened when i'm sedentary), sensation in airways. this is where asthma comes into it.

so this sensation in my airways. it is hard to describe as anything other than a ""sensation"". it is not comfortable, it happens to me in the cold and sometimes if i take too deep a breath in it will cause me to cough a lot. i always associated it with my asthma, but i never knew what it was. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THAT ACTUALLY IS?! every time i've asked a dr they've just given me a wishy-washy non answer. i just want to understand what i'm feeling. anyway...

aside from if i took a deep breath in, i wasn't coughing. no sneezing, no runny nose, etc. but because i woke up the next day still with a high fever i decided to go to the doctor's office and get tested again. negative. also negative for flu. 

i woke up this morning finally fever free. my symptoms are pretty much gone, except the sensation. and today it almost feels worse and more sensitive, it's never been this bad before. i also noticed i could feel and kind of taste a dense, thick, very flavorful (sorry lol) mucous in my chest. my chest still hurts also and it almost feels warm. but the chest pain really isn't bad, i don't want to alarm anyone. it's very mild. 

i'm having a GERD flare up and i know that can trigger asthma flare up. so maybe that is what is happening right now, but it still wouldn't explain the fever. has anyone else experienced anything like this? i used my albuterol last night but it didn't feel like it helped much. but then again maybe it did if i woke up this morning coughing with the sensation more and can taste mucous. any advice or insight  would be appreciated!"
"I don't know if I have asthma, doctor said no.

But I've gotten a few asthma-like attacks where I could barely breathe and would start wheezing heavily, my entire body would stiffen up too. I usually would just sit there alone and let it pass after some painful minutes but I'm kinda worried if it doesn't pass.

I can't get an inhaler without a prescription and everytime I've gotten an attack is after exercise or from being hit, so doctor says I'm just lazy and need more exercise."
"After some tests I found I have exercise induced asthma last February. I was given a pink inhaler to use an hour before I play sports. I tore my ACL a couple months after that. I‚Äôve had the inhaler for around 11 months now, can I still use it or do I need to get a new one?

"I have cold/exercise induced asthma, it's relatively mild, but it gets in the way of my job and fun.  I'm a ski instructor and go into the back country a good bit, so lots of exercise in cold, high climates.

Or do I have to live the rest of my life with a tight chest that can't get enough air whenever I do what I love?"

"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm a bioengineer and a patient of asthma as well. I‚Äôm currently in the process of redesigning the inhaler into a more cost effective device. I‚Äôm personally sick and tired of inhaler misuse and I want to create a solution for it. The end product is largely undefined because I‚Äôd like to use the peoples opinion to guide my engineering process. 

These are some questions I‚Äôd like answered. You are welcome to respond to the post or DM me directly, whichever works best for you.

Questions:

1. How long have you had asthma?
2. What‚Äôs the hardest part of living with asthma?
3. Why was it hard?
4. Can you explain the last time you encountered any problems? How did you get around it?
5. Have you ever switched to other inhalers or formulations? Did it work?
6. How much do you pay per refill?
7. How do you feel your experience with your inhaler could be improved? Or is it good the way it is? 
8. If there is anything else you feel I should know, please let me know.

Thank you and have a great day everyone!!"

If you ever need a prescription inhaler, but dont have access to a doctor to give you a prescription cause its too expensive in the USA, this pharmacy works extremely well.

"I know to empty my lungs, press, breathe in and then hold my breath for 10 seconds but how long do I actually press down the dispense the medicine?"
"It's a cheap 1,000 mg supplement, the type you find in plastic tubes in grocery stores and dissolve in a glass of water. I started drinking it a year or two ago, back when I was really poor, and needed an affordable way to get vitamin C in my diet. At the same time, I was going to see my asthma doctor to ask for a stronger dosage of my daily inhaler medicine, as my symptoms were bothering me too much. Lo and behold, those symptoms improved once I'd started drinking my vitamin C! Stronger medicine would have just been a waste of money.

I think it has to do with how asthma is chronic inflammation, and how vitamin C supports the immune system. Wish I'd thought of that earlier."
"Has anyone found a solution to the shakiness you get after using Albuterol? It's gotten worse as I've gotten older and I can't stand it. It last for hours, and I have to use it 4x a day. It keeps me up at night, and makes me anxious and on edge. Is there anything else that works similarly without these side effects?"
"We just had 2 feet of snow in Boston. The temperature was in the 10s. As I was shoveling snow, my heart skipped a beat, it happened twice, I looked at my heart rate it was at 135bpm. I had no problem with 135bpm when I exercised indoor. I ran inside and was out of breath and felt like I could‚Äôve fainted if I kept shoveling. It got better after a few minutes of resting but I was scared asf. The thing is I grew up in Boston and had no problem shoveling snow in frigid weather in the past. Anyone with similar experience or have any tips to prevent this from happening? I am also interested to see what others think why this happened."
"Been taking flixotide for some years. worried that I'm getting side effects from it now. Sometimes I feel hot and cold especially in my body and tongue. The tongue thing could also just be dehydration.
Anyone else had experience or advice? I will be talkingbto my doctor about it so dw I'll get it sorted."
"I went to the doctor 3 years ago for a check up and he said there was nothing wrong with me and it was probably anxiety but it feels like the symptoms are getting worse. I'm in good shape and dealt with anorexia a few years ago,so it's not because of weight. but when I go up the stairs at my school it takes me a few mins for my lungs to not hurt especially because cold air and deep breaths that feel like they do nothing causes more air to be inhaled. It always feels like there's a tight weight settling on my lungs, or chest area. I've learned to ignore the feeling because it never goes away and thinking about it makes it worse. Walking is fine but anytime I run or jump multiple times I run out of breath very fast.  My older brother also is diagnosed with asthma if that helps.
I don't want my family to think I'm being annoying or attention seeking because last time but it's very exhausting."

"The packaging and the pamphlet both say to discard Wixela 30 days after removing it from the pouch.

"My son has had many cold after being born but he had a bad cold that made him breathe heavily at 9 months and 11 months which required hospitalization. Few other times around 18 months as well and recently at 3 years old but no hospital visit and doctor prescribed Steroid and Albuterol treatment. In his case asthma is triggered by certain sore throats or can be classified as viral induced. Dust, dirt, pollen, running or doing strenuous activities do not trigger asthma only when he gets sore throat the heavy breathing starts one or two days later. He is 3 years old and now taking budesonide as preventative medicine and it worked one time as his most recent cold he was not breathing heavily. What do you think chances are that he will outgrow from this type of asthma which is triggered by colds as he gets older or do you think it will be required for his lifetime?"

"32 M. Started having Asthma issues 18 months ago. Tight chest and can‚Äôt take a full breathe. Same symptoms always. It was off and on but sometimes it would last days at a time. Finally went to a doctor. 

After several visits and various tests over a few months my doctor put me on Advair HFA 115 mcg/21mcg twice daily and a rescue inhaler as needed. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping me at all. 

Some days are worse than others but I still consistently have a tight chest and am unable to take a full deep breathe. This happens almost daily. Yawning is impossible because I can‚Äôt get a full breath in. Using a rescue inhaler doesn‚Äôt help relieve the issue. Usually do two puffs with a spacer. If I do another puff of Advair that doesn‚Äôt relieve the issue either. 

My primary doctor moved so I can‚Äôt reach out to her for advice. Before I go through this process again with a new doctor, I‚Äôm curious to see if there‚Äôs other medicine/remedies that help some of you with similar symptoms.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!"


"Mines been out of control since December because of getting sick. I was put on montelukast and now I'll be pit on a new maintenance inhaler.

"I am currently recovering from a mild attack after not being able to obtain my Advair for a few months. I was prescribed the Advair again as well as Prednisone and Albuterol refills for my nebulizer. 

My heart rate was already high from trying to get through the attack by leaning on my albuterol rescue inhaler too frequently. 

My question is, I feel like I should use my nebulizer again today to try to really knock this out and let the Advair and Prednisone do the rest but my heart rate is high. I wear a Fitbit and it‚Äôs usually around 74 bpm but I‚Äôve been hovering around 100-122 since I used my nebulizer yesterday. I‚Äôm currently uninsured and wondering if the high heart rate is worth the risk to clear out my lungs?

Anyone have asthma symptoms primarily at night? Seems like I've only ever had one or two flareups ever during the day whereas at night as I'm falling asleep breathing issues wake me up over and over.

"Hey,

Anyone have any experience with neb cromolyn sodium as a controller med? I am trying to make the switch however was off budesonide for a few nights and made the mistake of staying at my parent's house which has a very dusty attic.

"My son is 3 and was just diagnosed with asthma. The Dr wants to do Budesonide twice daily and Albuterol for flair ups. I have never really dealt with asthma before and am kinda scared of him having to be on long term meds at such a young age. But I of course want him to be healthy.

Does the daily use really have a noticeable benefit? 

Also if there is any mom groups for kids with asthma please let me know"

"I'm a 23 y/o guy who's developed allergic asthma over the last 5 months. My family has a history of asthma and reactive airway diseases, so I guess now is my turn to get the disease. Here's how I developed it:

Let's take it back to August 27th, 2021. I wake up after a night out as normal, go about my usual day in my last semester of college. Feel great. All of a sudden, I noticed a tightness on my chest, a feeling of having to take a deep breath to make sure I'm breathing, and felt a lump in my throat. Wasn't sure what it was, but was afraid to go the hospital. Thought I was having a heart attack. But I remembered that I had felt this before a couple of times, usually in a milder form. So, I thought it would go away as the day went on. 

Flash forward to about 10 days later, I'm in the hospital. Breathing is almost impossible, and I'm scared as all hell. Doctors assess me. Heart is normal, lungs are clear. The ER doctor determines I have acid reflux and give me famotidine and an inhaler to relieve the symptoms, then send me home. 

The shortness of breath remains and I get that lump in my throat feeling often. The chest tightness is much less severe but does have it's moments where it comes and goes. This goes on from September until October 2021. I think nothing of it and assume it's just the reflux still happening. Maybe I have GERD now? I should just follow the meds I've been given and go see my doctor. 

I talk to my doctor on October 5th, 2021. He says it was acid reflux that caused me to have an asthmatic reaction. I feel sort of relieved because he did acknowledge that I do have some sort of asthmatic reaction to stomach acid overproduction. After our talk, I keep taking the famotidine and lay off the inhaler because I think I don't need it. But, the shortness of breath and throat lump remain. The shortness of breath is constant, but the lump comes and goes. This continues for 3 months until January. 

It's January, and I stop taking famotidine because it made me dizzy during the day. Turns out my stomach didn't need it after all. The shortness of breath STILL remained, and was especially bad when I exercised. I mostly do strength lifting, so I'm working with heavy weights for sets of 5 at a time, so having shortness of breath during these lifts made me feel scared like something was wrong. I begin taking my rescue inhaler 2x a day. Once before exercise and once before bed. I begin to wonder if it ever really was acid reflux, and not something else...

Finally, today I determined that my symptoms are coming from allergic asthma. I made appointments with a pulmonologist and my doctor to have this confirmed and I have some good evidence to provide for them that what I'm experiencing is, in fact, allergic asthma. Beyond my family history. 

My triggers are as follows from severe to mild: beer, wine, and dark liquor (from sulfites), dogs, dust, pollen, rubber, cats, and chlorine (work at an indoor pool). This is just from what I've noticed.

My family has a history of asthma and reactive airway diseases, like I said before. I've never had a problem with symptoms of those diseases in my entire life, up until now. I suppose it's just my genetics saying that it's my turn to experience them.

So that's my story. TL;DR I went to the hospital for what was thought to be bad acid reflux but has since turned out to be allergic asthma from the exhibited symptoms. 

I'm just glad to read some of the posts on here and not feel alone. Turns out it's more common than I think. Hell, some of my best friends have it too now that I think about it. I'll feel a lot better once I see a pulmonologist and doctor and get properly evaluated and medicated. Feel free to leave comments!"

"Been looking this up since it's worth learning about any new medicine you get put on, but there's a lot of scary stuff out there, but a lot of it from 2007-2011 and sounds like FDA updated guidance in 2017? Anyway, suspected that the reason I've struggled to exercise my whole life, and dealt with scratchy feeling airways, was probably mild asthma. The doctor seems to think so and symptoms line up. It's never been more than some wheezing when I try to run so I can live with it, I just really want to do more intense exercise. They put me straight on 500/50 but that sounds like the max dosage, and I see stuff like Advair is for asthma that's not responding to other meds? Should I call back tomorrow and ask about this? Because my prescription is getting filled tomorrow. I think the plan is to do it for 30 days only but she didn't specify much beyond that. She also prescribed albuterol which I also am getting filled but said I probably wouldn't need it since I've never had a serious attack or anything, was this just SOP or is it because of the Advair? Mainly I can live with what I have now I just don't want to take medicine that might make it worse long term. TIA"
"Hello!

Recently I've noticed that it's been becoming more difficult for me to breathe in general. I'm a minor, so this surprised me a little. I can usually breathe okay for a while, but if I overexert myself I sometimes feel so out of breath I feel as though I'm going to pass out.

This can happen even when I'm just walking up a flight of stairs to my next class, if I walk too fast in general, when I'm dancing. We were doing prances the other day and I almost collapsed, not mostly from exhaustion but because I wasn't able to breathe well.

And when I lose my breath I find it hard to catch my breath as well. It takes me a minute, sometimes several, of just deep breathing. I sometimes actually have to take my mask down to catch my breath.

I'm not sure if it's asthma, to be honest. Barely anybody in my family has it, and I'm 16. That really feels too late. I also don't think I've ever just stopped being able to breathe, it's just very difficult.

Spiritually I don't think it's possible either. I've had a lot of trauma + I have Tourettes, so it just seems unlikely that I have asthma. I was thinking of bringing it up to my Dad, but decided that it could wait half a minute for me to ask for a second opinion.

What do you guys think? I'm a minor and my Dad is not open about a lot of health-related issues. Could this be something more, like asthma? Or does it just come with age?

Thank you all so much for your inputs in advance!"
Tomorrow I see my pulmonologist. But rn it's a bit hard to breathe and I don't know if I take my albuterol again or not
Is anyone currently on the Vannair asthma pump ?
"I recently purchased a soy based scented candle from a store where the owner claimed that everything in her store is ""clean"" because she's allergic to most everything. The candle was nice smelling but still made me cough somewhat. 

Are there any scented candles or oil infused candles that are good for people with asthma/allergies? I like scents as part of aromatherapy."
"I tested positive for covid on 12/27. I had a mild fever for 1 day and thought it was on the clear. About a week later, I experienced shortness of breath similar to an asthma attack. Since then, (3 weeks), I have experienced intermittent shortness of breath and have been struggling to breathe. I did a 5 day prednisone treatment, and robitussin seems to help. The shortness of breath just keeps coming back.

At this point I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs covid related or just asthma because the shortness of breath occurred a week after my symptoms went away.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? If so, do you have helpful advice?"
"Everyday I wake up with a persistent cough. It‚Äôs a productive cough &amp; it‚Äôs bothersome. My inhaler helps, but I‚Äôd like to prevent it rather than only treating it. 

I‚Äôm new to asthma (bizarre adult onset asthma) and still learning my triggers. It is winter and allergy season where I live so that probably isn‚Äôt helping.

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. My poor roommates have to hear it everyday lol."
Do you have any unusual or weird asthma symptoms? What are they?
"Possibly relevent info: 18 year old male, 85kg, 188cm(\~6.2f) tall. I don't smoke. I've been allergic to basically everything(all kinds of pollen, dust mites etc) my whole life. I've had allergy symptoms but they disappeared and somehow ""migrated"" to my lungs. Now I VERY rarely experience itchy eyes, runny nose, itchy throat(usual allergy symptoms), instead I have a congested nose, mucus in my throat and \*EXTREMELY irritable lungs\*. This confuses my because most asthmatics have a problem with trouble breathing, tightness in chest etc. Rarely I have trouble breathing but I nearly always have this need to cough(in my chest) forcing me to cough(dry) and a ""vibration-like"" sensation in my chest(when coughing). Anyone have an answer? 

This has gotten only worse after I had covid(I tested positive 20 days ago). Despite the mild symptoms(fever, a bit of cough, mildly runny nose and being tired) my symptoms got worse(especially the cough). Today is the worst day - I used the nose spray, Symbicort 160 three times in 5 hours(I know it's too much).

My current therapy is: 2x1 Dymista(nose spray containing corticosteroids, Symbicort 160mcg(at least 2 a day, I usually go up to 4-5 which worries me). And it's still sometimes not enough. The weirdest part is that I've been told I have somewhat mild asthma. Here's my spirometry, if someone would be kind enough to interpret it. Thanks.

Bro. I'm just having mad anxiety rn. So like around Christmas I got told by a hospital I have asthma. And was given an inhaler. The thing is this doesn't do anything really at all. I have a cough every day and a shit ton of sputum in the back of my throat and my chest hurts. Sometimes I can go through an entire inhaler in one week. Well my dumb ass decided to smoke unfiltered tobacco out of a bong around 4 nights ago and ever since then I've not been able to breath properly. I went to the hospital and they checked my oxygen levels and blood and sent me home. I told them this but I don't think they knew my asthma was untreated? It's currently raining a bit and I think it's related to rain. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow to ay'all am I gonna die or something in my sleep.
"To be clear, I am not seeking medical advice.  What I am seeking is awareness of the available alternatives so I can be educated when I do see the doctor."

"Just curious‚Ä¶ any other long distance runner, swimmer, biker, backpacker, campers or anything out there?

"So I have a 6 yr old. Since Covid started in 2020, she was staying with her grandma in the house pretty much in a bubble for a year and a half, and around no kids besides the few at her Church. Anyway, so she started school in august, and made it through the first week fine, but then the next week she had these coughing episodes at night where she‚Äôd throw up from coughing so much, sometimes run a fever and sometimes not. Sometimes a runny nose but usually the whole thing starts out as stuffy. Happened every month nearly like clockwork until I seen a diff doctor in her office. She‚Äôs now on flovent 2 puffs 2x a day as well as flonase once a day (1 spray in each nostril) she‚Äôd been on antibiotics every month nearly, and in December I had enough and wanted answers. So she had a chest X-ray, bloodwork, and something else. No Covid flu or pneumonia Thank God, but her doc and I are baffled as to what causes these episodes. And it comes in the same pattern!! Anyone have any ideas?"

"Bear with me here , I‚Äôm kinda new to this as I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with asthma but with asthmatic bronchitis a few years ago. I still think i do have asthma tho because those episodes were straight up asthma episodes where i couldn‚Äôt exhale the air. 

I‚Äôm mostly fine now except that sometimes at night I‚Äôd feel a tingling in my throat(different from any other), a tingling that makes me cough but the cough doesn‚Äôt really scratch it? It just make me unable to breathe for a few seconds. 
Is this what asthma feels like? Or is it something else?

Also could second hand smoke be a trigger for a burning sensation in the chest? Like no coughing, jut a lot of phlegm and weird feeling in the chest. I stopped smoking a year ago but my bf is a heavy smoker and we live together. I‚Äôve never had this problem until now and I thought it was because I was exposed to someone who has Covid but it doesn‚Äôt make sense for this to be the only symptom, also i‚Äôve tested negative a few times already. 

Like i have no problem being around smokers but I think it may be because he smokes A LOT and there is constantly smoke or the smell of smoke in the house.

If someone can  offer me some insight on this  would be great cus I‚Äôm not really that informed on the asthma topic mostly because i never really thought i‚Äôve had a bigger problem than a bronchitis who went away.

TLDR: experience with night cough and second hand smoke being a trigger for asthma (weird chest feeling and a lot of throat phlegm ) ?"
"I was diagnosed with cough variant asthma as a child and seemed to outgrow it until 2017 when I got double pneumonia. After that I seemed to have a resurgence with my asthma. Got pneumonia again in 2019. It‚Äôs been the same since. 

Earlier I took a PFT and results came back normal. I took it in the morning when my symptoms are usually much less severe. But the results made me doubt if I even have asthma anymore. 

Now in the middle of the night, I‚Äôm wheezing upon exhale. A couple of times when i go to then doctor they can hear wheezing which is rare. I'm waiting to take the methacholine challenge soon. Does anyone else still have normal PFTs but still have asthma?"
"Some needed background: I had to go off my steroid maintenance at the end of November because of a bad reaction (which is the third or fourth reaction after different steroid meds) and have to wait for allergy testing for a possible steroid allergy now (and should not have any steroids until then). So my lungs were already not in their best shape when I got chlorine poisoning on top of it on Friday (no fault of my own, landed me in the ER and lungs have been completely wrecked since then as, surprise, they couldn't treat me with steroids).

Now I got my Moderna booster regardless yesterday (after clearing it with my doc), and since yesterday evening, breathing feels a bit easier again. This morning was the first morning since the chlorine poisoning that I woke up without my whole upper body breathing for me (auxiliary breathing muscles for the win, those champs have been working serious overtime since Friday!).

I'm still not well again, but I do feel considerably better and as if my breathing is easier and less reliant on the auxiliary muscles.

Just sharing this here because it was an utterly unexpected plot twist, and if I remember correctly, there have been some more people over the past year who reported an improvement to their asthma after their covid vaccine(s) here (along with others who reported exacerbations, and a lot of others who reported no change at all)."

"My son is 12 and has lots of environmental allergies and is allergic to tree nuts. He started allergy shots last summer for the environmental allergens and so slowly working on those. Once each fall for two previous years, he would have some chest tightness/cough after rolling around in the grass outside. Allergist found no evidence of asthma, but prescribed inhaler just in case.

In the last 6 months, he has had some random heart palpitations. Cardiologist said everything was all clear. 

Now he is having some random periods of breathlessness‚Ä¶he says it will be for a few seconds and then he feels fine. 

He said today that it felt like his chest was kind of rumbling and he caught his breath. Then he stops and breaths in and is fine and it goes away. One time happened when he was talking to a teacher and the other was after PE and then one time here at home.

He is on allergy medication: Zyrtec, Singulair, and nasal spray. 

We will be following up with the doctor of course and I know that asthma is common with allergies, but I have zero experience with it and am wondering if this sounds like it or something else? 

It is so hard to tell when it happens so quickly and is seemingly random and not consistent. 

Thanks for any thoughts or anything else I should look for."

I am 34, healthy, i run with no problem, yet my biggest score was 340. Based on this, i was just diagnosed with asthma, literally two hours ago.

"Hi reddit. I am a 34 y/o female with asthma. Severe asthma runs in my family, and my own asthma has steadily been getting worse over the years. This October, I caught a cold during a camping trip. I developed bronchitis, and I still have not fully recovered. Most of the time, I am fine. But, sometimes, I start uncontrollably hacking.

I live in NYC, where we are experiencing unusually cold weather. Yesterday, I walked out of the subway (one set of stairs) and immediately felt out of breath. For context, I am pretty physically active and often bike ~20 miles per day - and so this is very unusual. I then proceeded to start hacking. I felt like I was on the top of a mountain. I threw up five separate times on my short walk home (usually takes ~ 15 minutes, took me an hour this time). It felt like I was throwing up from altitude sickness. I have never thrown up from asthma before, but I do know that this can happen. My nebulizer and getting inside helped, but I am still really scared. I am staying home from work today, largely because im scared of exposing myself to covid if my asthma has reached this new level.

I am wondering if others can relate and, if so, how you are navigating this. I am honestly terrified."

"... and I feel amazing! Just wanted to share my win.

I saw a doctor for the first time in 6 years about my asthma. I had asthma ever since I was a kid and always took it after playing sports or gym class. I've been letting it go uncontrolled for far too long ever since I started college and moved away from my parents. I just simply didn't have the time or money to see a doctor. My new doctor prescribed me a 90 mcg albuterol inhaler, taken 2 twice every 4 hours. 

I figured that I would just take it after exercising like I used to, but I tried sticking to the regimen that was prescribed to see how I feel. And MAN, I'm 4 puffs in and there's such a difference! I finally don't feel constriction and tension in my chest, I can breathe deeply, and I just feel way better all over. Within the first minute of taking it, I could feel my airways opening and air getting all the way into my lungs for the first time in a long time.

Getting an inhaler was the first step I wanted to take in reclaiming control over my health and I'm glad I'll be able to exercise without fear of not being able to breathe anymore."

Every morning I wake up my first couple breaths upon standing I feel and hear a squeaky crackle in my bottom right lung. I'm always coughing up phlegm.

"Hi fellow asthma redditors! I have a question on prednisone. Last time I took it (several years ago), I think it was maybe 5 pills or 6 first day, then 4, 3, 2, 1 the subsequent days or a similar schedule.
This time, it‚Äôs 3 a day for 7 days.
How is it prescribed to you when you get it?

Quick summary of my asthma: usually gets triggered by a cold or virus, mostly control it with albuterol &amp; Breo. I‚Äôm allowed to stop treatment when I feel better as I might not get another attack for a year or two.
Prednisone is usually prescribed to me after few weeks of albuterol/Breo not cutting it like this time. Usually they do a good job but this time doctor thinks I had RSV so it hit me harder. Tested negative for Covid, have 3 doses of Pfizer shot."

"I have pulmonary fibrosis, rather than asthma, but I've found that anything that bothers y'all, bothers me. So I hope you'll accept me as a brother in spirit. 

I just bought a home in a city near the SE coast in the hope that the weather and high salinity will help my persistent congestion and coughing fits. We're slowly setting up the house and during the course of some HVAC work, we were recommended to get duct sealing, fogging, and a Platinum UV air purifier. Based on my research, these all seem like standard/premium fare for suburban residential HVAC services. I couldn't find a lot of info on pricing but the quotes seem reasonable. The house was built in the early 50s, and is moderately dusty but I think a lot of that is just us moving in. They shared photos of their inspections showing the dust building up in the ducts. I have an indoor air quality monitor on order but it will be a couple weeks before it arrives.

I found some sources that suggested that some dust buildup in the ducts really doesn't matter as much, and suggested that these types of services in some situations are superfluous and oversold. 

Has anyone had these services done and did they seem to make a difference? Would really love to hear if you've had this done and it improved your air quality."

"Hello!

My asthma and allergies have been really intense lately. I had minimal side effects from the first and second dose last year, and I want to get boosted given COVID is so bad right now.

However, I got the doses in March and my allergic asthma has been really bad since October, despite using my maintenance inhalers, allergic pills, and albuterol.

I am going to start Singulair soon to see if that helps, but in the meantime would love the extra protection from COVID while I work on getting my asthma in control.

Has anyone gotten the booster whilst their asthma symptoms were bad? Should I wait until my asthma is a little better? Would hate to get COVID while I‚Äôm waiting for my new medication to kick in."

"I have had asthma for quite a while and use an albuterol inhaler. It use to work very well when I had bad wheezing and it would go away about 10-20 mins after using it. However, this past week I have been coughing and wheezing very badly. I have tried using my albuterol inhaler several times throughout the week but it no longer seems to be effective at reducing or eliminating the wheezing. Could this be due to my asthma becoming uncontrolled to the point where albuterol isn‚Äôt powerful enough to help? Or could another sickness accompanied with asthma be reducing the effect that the albuterol has?

I have already talked to my primary care provider about the worsening severity, I am just curious as to why the inhaler is no longer able to work as it once did."

We need you (18+ USA iPhone w/ Asthma)! We'll send you a free peak flow meter and an amazon gift card. Sign up a [flowdio.ai](https://flowdio.ai)
"So I have been suffering asthma like symptoms for 2.5 months after covid.  I had one pft test November 28th and passed so they said no asthma. I'm going to another pulmo the 27th for another test.  Anyway.  I have been taking peak flow measurements. At home it averages 500-530. At work It averages 530-550. I was thinking maybe I had a nice air filter at work perhaps or in fact I do have asthma hence the lower number at home from idk mold or something??

Thanks"

"Have any of you reduced the frequency of your Dupixent shots? 

My pulmonologist has agreed (after I asked) to move me from every 2 weeks to every 3, and see how I feel (I‚Äôve been quite stable for a while which is why I asked her if I could). Many of you use Dupixent so if anyone has done this I‚Äôd love to hear how it went/how it‚Äôs going. Thanks! (PS, I posted a similar Q on the eczema board as they have many many Dupixent users.)"
"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm suffering from night asthma and I've been reading that air purifiers can help a lot! I already own a (cheap) humidifier which has been helping a lot, but not completely.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if someone could suggest a valid air purifier and, maybe a silly question, where would be the best place to keep it. Should this be in the bedroom, where the major attacks happen?"
New pulm doc is ordering blood work so we can look at biologics!  Is it wrong to be excited about the potential of using biologics to help?

"45yo male, moderate asthma controlled. Fully vaxed and boosted but still had a breakthrough infection that started 3 days ago. Over all VERY mild, but experiencing a slight bit of wheezing. My O2 is fine.

"Recently I‚Äôve noticed a whistle sound (wheeze) when I exhale deeply , if I breath normally it‚Äôs not there . Symptoms are weird and hard to describe . Anyways I‚Äôm wondering if I have asthma and yes I‚Äôll go to the doctor very soon but I‚Äôm curious on why my wheezing and mild feeling out of breath goes away when I‚Äôm running ?

When and after running im breathing heavier then I would not running (obviously) yet I don‚Äôt hear the whistle/wheeze sound and feel like I can catch my breath easily . Why is that ? 

I‚Äôve also noticed that my ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù practically go away when I‚Äôm in public , don‚Äôt something else but when I‚Äôm thinking about it and at home that‚Äôs when they start to happen . 

It‚Äôs just weird so I‚Äôd love to hear your opinions . Thanks"

"I‚Äôve had exercise induced asthma symptoms for almost 10 years now. They have gradually gotten worse and vary DRAMATICALLY. I can go run a 5K and have little breathing issues one day then the next day get one block and feel like I get hit in the chest.  In 2018 I ran a half marathon with zero breathing issues.  The next run I got 1/4 mile and had to stop. I haven‚Äôt found anything that has consistently or even really made a difference. Extended warm ups and lower intensity doesn‚Äôt seem to do much. Medications don‚Äôt do much. It‚Äôs like I have to just start exercising and see what‚Äôs going to happen that day. I‚Äôm looking for more aggressive or last ditch effort suggestions that might help. At this point I‚Äôll try almost anything to be able to exercise and not have breathing be the limiting factor.  Below are things I‚Äôve tried:

- Albuterol up to 4 hits and up to an hour+ prior to exercise bouts
- Allergy test (seasonal)
- daily Zyrtec, Claritin, and Benadryl in case of random allergy
- Repeatedly holding my breath prior to exercise trying to ‚Äústretch/prep/warm up bronchioles and lungs (seems to help a little)
- extended warm up periods
- low intensity 
- selective weather conditions
- indoor only cardio"

"Hello! Anybody here take ADHD meds and asthma meds? If so, have you experienced any bad side effects?

I just started Flovent, which is great for my asthma, but I‚Äôm finding that I can‚Äôt concentrate *at all*. It‚Äôs so strange. It‚Äôs like my ADHD medicine has stopped working completely. In conversations, I keep asking people to repeat what they just said. I was listening to a podcast yesterday, and I had to rewind every 30 seconds. 

I‚Äôm also taking albuterol daily now because my asthma has been so bad. Maybe that‚Äôs affecting my ADHD meds?

I‚Äôd pause the asthma meds, except that then I wouldn‚Äôt be able to concentrate because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to breathe.

Anyway, if anyone has experience using asthma inhalers and stimulant medications, I‚Äôd love to hear their thoughts.

Thanks!"
Read there could be an interaction and that concerns me. Thoughts?
I know steroids typically make you gain weight but I seem to have lost weight during and after the steroid taper. I know I was very very anxious and jittery so I probably was not eating regularly. I have health anxiety and of course this makes me worried it could be something awful.
"I‚Äôm a 40 yo Dad of two, asthmatic, looking to get away from the cold dry air of Salt Lake City. Unfortunately the air quality has been greatly impacted by population growth, global warming (wild fires in the west) and above all Poor politics. I‚Äôm hoping to move to a place that allows me to get my health back. Have been doing some research online for the best cities for asthmatics in the US, but would love to hear from my fellow patients if this condition. My main triggers are colds, sinus infections that almost always end up causing problems with my lungs."
I should just continue taking it regulary right? or maybe take more puffs today? i think this might be the first time in years i totally skip a dose by accident...would love to hear from people who skipped a dose and nothing happened to them
"My doctor is pretty much refusing to see patients and I can only get appointments with his nurse practitioner who doesn't know a lot about asthma.

For the past year or two, my asthma has either been worsening or my maintenance meds have become less effective. I went from no hospital visits in 10+ years to at least one per year. The doctor added accolate to my medication regimen and although it helps, it has not yet gotten me back to where I used to be.

I've been on Advair since around age 8. I'm 25 now. It's very likely that my body is no longer fully responding to the Advair. However, I am terrified to try changing medications.

The nurse practitioner has pretty much made it sound like Trelegy is my only option after this. I don't know if this is accurate or not. I fear that if I start Trelegy too early, it'll end up not working too soon and I won't have other options.

**Has anybody switched successfully from Advair to something other than Trelegy?** The only medication I've tried before was singular as a child and I had terrible side effects.

I think I'm also afraid whatever new medication they put me on just won't work at all and I'll end up with another ER bill. However, I know that if I keep not changing anything, this will happen anyway.

**In addition, do you think a new doctor would be willing to see me and also help me switch medications in the same visit?** I simply do not trust the nurse practitioner to mess with my medications at this point due to past experiences with her handling my asthma poorly.

I'm just so stressed out trying to navigate this."
I‚Äôm getting over omicron (day 9 after testing positive) and I‚Äôm using my ventolin as well as my symbicort daily now to breathe normally (it used just be the Symbicort x 2 a day) does anyone know if this settles down after a while or does my medication need to be increased? I have a pretty active lifestyle so it‚Äôs kind of worrying me.
"Ugh, I hate air hunger. Oximeter seems ok, but it's jumping all over the place between 90 and 100. It sucks to feel like you can't get enough air.

"Hi there

I had covid last month and it knocked me on my butt. My asthma was completely exacerbated. I had asthma attacks, needed neb treatments daily and was short of breath. this is all new territory to me. 

Now I‚Äôm on Symbicort twice a day. A bit better but now I have lost my voice. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I walked into a dusty area in a school (I immediately needed my albuterol once I got my my car) or it‚Äôs my asthma in general, or it‚Äôs my inhaler. 


Any advice or info welcome. Thank you."

I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in 2020 and I have undergone 4 Chemotherapy and radiation  which after 3 months the cancer cells regenerate and spread to my liver with severe pains and lump, ever since then I have been looking for solutions on how to cure it naturally. I have spent a lot on hospitals and I have already lost hope in leaving. On a beautiful day when surfing the internet I came across a patient testimonial who was cured from Stage 4 Skin Cancer and Lungs damages. The patients speak highly of Doctor Salim Herbal formula and shared his information. I was curious because there are a lot of scams on the internet but decided to give the herbal specialist a trial, I contacted Dr Salim and after much discussion and questions I placed an order for his products which were more affordable than Chemo which he sent to my address through DHL service. He gave me directions on how to use the products. I was on his protocol for the first week and I discovered a huge difference in my health. The lump was gone after completing his first treatment for 21 days. I went for a scan which showed little protein cells on my breast. I was overwhelmed and I quickly disclose the result to the herbal specialist and he asked me to place another product which I did immediately which I used for another 21 days and after completing the treatment my enlarged breast was completely reduced, no lump no more pains and the sores went away today makes it a year I have been cured from breast cancer. I recommend him to anyone with;  Herpes Virus &amp; outbreak, type 1 &amp; 2 Diabetes, HPV, Fibroid,  Arthritis, Prostate, ED, COPD, Lyme Disease, Asthma, Psoriasis, Yeast Infection. His info.

"Hi, Im 21 years old and have vaped nicotine and flower as well as cigarettes for a few years and cannabis. I was smoking all of these heavily at the age of 16 till now. I remember years ago I would have bad breathing reactions to certain carts and vapes. I had asthma as a child but it disappeared. Anyways, would start to feel a heavy sensation on my left side of my chest at around 18 but thought nothing of it kept vaping, would stop for a couple months from a scare and then continue when symptoms were gone which was very stupid of me. Also have been to the ER multiple times due to peanut allergy. Smoking weed and vaping would make my left side of the chest to feel inflamed and tight, as well as heavy. Now this year is the worst year for me because I was exposed to a lot of sawdust while using an angle grinder in sculpture class without wearing proper protection. After this day my lungs felt so inflamed and a stinging sensation that caused me to visit the ER three days later. They put me on a nebulizer and some medication and I got better, stupid enough to start vaping. I would begin cackling up mucus like clearing my throat with a lot of mucus from the sawdust incident and vaping. Now I have stopped smoking all together and my doctor said I have asthma but never gave me a pulmonary test, put me on wixella and albuterol. Whenever I get a flare up even 10 puffs of albuterol doesn't work. I now get the random left side chest pains a lot. I also take GERD medication that doesn't help. Now three days days ago I contracted covid, had a fever one day, the next day had a really really bad exacerbation episode that led me to the ER. Left side still stung and hurt. Now its been three days and my lungs feel like how they did from the sawdust, just messed up, heavy. Hard to catch a breath. Lungs feel hard and different, cough feels really crunchy and hard and it clears out mucus, but I'm not really coughing I'm clearing my throat. Nebulizer doesn't really work. I feel bubbling sometimes and can also feel my lung throbbing sometimes. I have the cackling clearing of mucus sometimes as well. I really hope I can heal from this and I regret my smoking history so much. I am an aspiring artist at school and have always been so excited for my future. Im having unbearable amounts of anxiety right now thinking my asthma might be copd. Have a doctor's appointment tomorrow over the phone but just wanted somewhere to type. My mother passed away from lung cancer in 2018, she smoked when she was young, so I already have huge anxiety on that, I dont know why I kept smoking after that I kept thinking, "" vaping and weed isn't bad as long as its not cigs"". Im scared and stuck in my head. Can anyone relate with my symptoms? Is it even asthma?"

So what will be the type?

And i wanted to start working out. After about 20-25 min i start to feel uneasiness in my lungs so I stop. Any advice on that?

"So my twin and I had sever asthma as a kid, to the point we were hospitalized a lot for attacks and having to do those overnight treatments at home constantly. When we moved from NYC down to MD are asthma improved so much we forgot we had it. It was to the point that we didn‚Äôt even need are inhalers anymore. Fast forward to more then 12 years later and at 23 my asthma came back. I think I had a bad pneumonia or possibly COVID never got clarification as  at the time testing wasn‚Äôt being done‚Ä¶and my asthma came back . 

I also developed or at least became aware of my seasonal allergies in which I‚Äôm allergic to every pollen and tree, dust‚Ä¶you name it I‚Äôm allergic. 

now I have an asthma attack at least once a month we‚Äôre I can‚Äôt get away with not using my inhaler. My twin just recently had to go to hospital to do a treatment and get steroid. She hasn‚Äôt had an attack since.
I haven‚Äôt gotten that bad but I am feeling more chest pains and more fatigue.

 I did just recently get COVID  about 3 weeks ago and have recovered since  with only congestion at night. I think I only had one asthma attack while having  COVID as at night my oxygen dropped to 93 I used inhaler and felt better 20 minutes later O2 went up to 96. With COVID my 02 was at a steady 95 and went back to normal range which is 98/99 for me after a week. 

I did go to ER since I lost my inhaler a week ago and pretty sure I had an attack two days before but used coffee to help. However my chest felt flighty and tired. I was sure I was having a mild attack when at ER but my respiration was fine and the doctor didn‚Äôt hear anything in my chest. I got my new inhaler took it and my chest felt much better. 

Today I took it again and my chest felt better. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm having an attack I know what that feels like it‚Äôs more like my chest is feeling heavy and slightly burning. But I am constantly fatigued and this has happened to me before COVID. 

If my asthma is mild but developing to moderate how do I express this to doctor?"
"I'm going through a particularly rough flare up at the moment and keep getting bad headaches start whenever I've just had a bad coughing fit. Feels like my brain is wobbling around in my skull every time. üò©

"So I‚Äôve had asthma since I was three years old and I‚Äôd like to think I know how to manage it pretty well. Im currently sick and this doc at Kaiser said they only prescribe either albuterol for a nebulizer, or albuterol inhalers, but it will get ‚Äúflagged‚Äù if they prescribe both within a certain window of time. I‚Äôve never in my life heard this, I‚Äôve always had docs prescribe both so I have new ones for the year. 

She asked why I used a nebulizer and I was stunned. Am I crazy? I feel like the relief I get from the two when I‚Äôm actually sick is leagues apart. I use an inhaler when I‚Äôm on a hike and need it, not when I have bronchitis. She said she only prescribes inhalers typically. In fact, my nebz prescription is taking forever to fill, probably because they never prescribe it! Plus it‚Äôs some weird giant bottle with a dropper instead of individual vials, I feel like that‚Äôs going to be way less sterile for how little I need it."
"I have adult onset cough variant asthma. When I get an upper respiratory infection, I get bronchitis and then I end up with the adult onset asthma - takes a few weeks to get over the latter.   I had covid at the end of November, which turned in to wicked bronchitis, which then just completely wrecked my bronchial airway.   Yesterday, my asthma dr decided to add in a short course of dexamethasone to knock out the bronchial inflammation. He gave me 5 days at 6mg and said no need to taper.   

Should I taper??? About 15 years ago (I'm 52) I was given a short dose prednisone for the same thing, didn't taper and felt bad for several days after.   I'm going to talk to my doctor today about tapering, but is it possible to create a short taper starting on day 4 by breaking one pill in half for two days, then taking the last pill and breaking in 4ths for the next 4 days??? Any suggestions??? I know there are some asthma experts on here.  Should I just not taper???  Thank you."

"Hi! I was wondering if anyone has been positive to omicron and had different symptoms like a wet cough vs a dry cough. 

So, I have allergic asthma very much under control (so much so that I haven‚Äôt used my inhaler in forever) and seasonal allergies which cause rhinitis. 

I was on immunotherapy for 5 years and my rhinitis episodes basically went away. Well, severe ones anyway. 

But here‚Äôs the thing, I‚Äôm having what I call a severe allergic episode and it all starts with rhinitis: runny/itchy nose (super watery), constant sneezing, watery eyes, congestion, headache (because rhinosinusitis), itchy ears and general malaise. (Day one)

Then I get a scratchy throat and it hurts when I swallow.

Congestion continues and no more sneezing nor runny nose but still some mucus discharge and mostly post nasal. No more scratchy throat but still some discomfort. A feeling of tightness in the chest, no difficulty breathing and a mostly dry cough. 

After that, cough turns wet, and I start wheezing when I breathe until I cough and clear/swallow sputum. 

Finally crackling when I breath on top of the wheezing and wet cough.  

I never develop a fever so my treatment consists on antihistamines, ibuprofen and a nasal spray. If the wheezing and crackling is bad then I get an inhaler. In the past I‚Äôve needed a nebulizer but since the allergies and asthma have been under control I haven‚Äôt had the need for one in a long time thankfully.

So far the progression this time has been faster, I‚Äôm on day 3 and the wheezing has already started and I‚Äôve been concerned about omicron because the symptoms are similar to those of an allergic episode. Except for the wet cough and wheezing but I‚Äôm wondering if asthmatics experience these or not. 

I‚Äôve taken the necessary precautions in case it could be COVID but I don‚Äôt want to go get tested and expose myself to actual sick people. 

I‚Äôm 99% sure this is an allergy thing because I did something stupid: worked up a sweat walking/playing with my brother‚Äôs dog (to whom I‚Äôm mildly allergic), came home, undressed and turned on the ceiling fan to dry out until I got super cold. That night I started with the sneezing an itchy nose/ears. I‚Äôve also haven‚Äôt been in close contact with anyone except mom and brother and we‚Äôre all vaccinated. 

Neither my mom nor my brother have developed any symptoms. 

TLDR; I did something stupid and got ‚Äúsick‚Äù, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs allergies but I‚Äôm concerned about omicron."
"Hi everyone. I‚Äôve had asthma as a kid but it completely disappeared, would reappear sometimes during winter but now as an adult it‚Äôs back!!

"I started taking prednisone a few days ago (initially given 5 days 40mg). And I fucked up after 3 days and missed a dose. Took it immediately the next day but my asthma kicked back in. Saw another doctor (pcp not available) and she stated me on a 10 day taper starting at 50 for 2 days, 40 for 2 days etc. Since I missed the dose I have been feeling like crap. Headaches, body pain, trouble concentrating, endless appetite especially for sugar, anxiety, stomach cramps, insomnia, irritable, and I‚Äôm always hot and sweaty (my wife swears the thermostat is not broken and it really is 70 degrees as she lays covered under piles of blankets). 

I‚Äôve been on prednisone many times through my life. I‚Äôve had asthma for several decades. I‚Äôve only had this reaction once before. I was given a 3 day dose of 60 at the ER and no taper. Two days after I stopped taking the 60mg I felt like I was dying with the same above vague symptoms. I spoke to two separate doctors and neither would believe that I was experiencing withdrawal and they both ignored me and refused to prescribe anything. So I took leftover prednisone (I know, I know!) that I had and tapered myself and the symptoms went away. 

I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm experiencing similar symptoms (not as extreme as the withdrawal though) when I‚Äôve been back on prednisone for 3 days now. 

I was hoping for some personal advice or experiences with my situation, google hasn‚Äôt been too helpful. I‚Äôm not holding out a lot of hope for advice from a doctor but that will be my next stop if need be"
"I have what I call night terrors, which is just having serious attacks throughout the night, to the point I can't even remember most of them. Due to this I run out of rescue inhalers extremely fast.

I have a prescription for nebulizer fluid, and I was wondering if using them in a humidifier at night is possible so I can sleep easier?"
"I have really well controlled mild-moderate persistent asthma, and I'm kind of old hat at managing it - I'm 45 years old now and have had asthma since childhood.  I'm on lowest dose of Advair AM and Flovent PM for life.

I've started to have a problem with exercise tolerance every late summer through early winter for three years in a row now, and I know for sure (due to trips to the ER when this began) that some of it is hyperventilation, not asthma - but the attack mimics an asthma attack.  This was proven through blood chemistry.

I usually walk 4-6 km daily, but as this kicks up each year (ragweed?  new mold allergy?) I find I can't even walk without becoming short of breath, and it persists for 3-6 months!

I'm back to walking again, for about a month, and still getting out-of-puff on inclines or going at my usual pace of 9 minute kms, so I'm still closer to 10-11 minute kms and only 3-4 km a day, but I'm starting to feel pretty ready to move and start cardio again.

This week I have tried a rowing machine and an exercise bike on separate days and was unable to do more than 8 easy minutes on either before my throat (just above collarbone) starts feeling tight and exhaling becomes more difficult - HR is around 130 bpm and I am fatigued.  I cool down a bit, and spend the next hour feeling exhausted and then go back to normal!  Peak flow stays pretty normal - just slightly lower (10%, tops - still well within tolerance) because I'm tired...

Is this just plain middle aged out-of-shape sensations, or is this exercise induced asthma that's really fleeting and self-resolving?  When this happened a few months back (when the cycle began) I did take rescue inhaler after and didn't find it helped resolve anything.

Appreciate any input, ideas or shared experience!  Mostly looking for some hope that this will pass and I can get back into some kind of shape?"

"I hope I'm not alone on this, but I was born with bad asthma.  I used to need machine to help me breathe at night, but now it's gotten a bit better. The thing is it annoys me so much when people smoke and vape. They're willing to give themselves an issue that I wish I wasn't born with. It makes me really jealous I suppose. Also I hate how they always want to do it around me, specifically people who vape, after I tell them to stop because I have issues breathing and they don't care. The reason I say people who vape is because now a lot of smokers will just leave the room but with people who vape they don't care since they think people are okay with their blueberry smelling juice lol."
So my old pulm retired. He diagnosed me over a year ago with severe uncontrolled asthma after doing a PFT.  Most recently he switched me to Breztri before he retired and I saw a new doc.

Around 5 months ago, I ended up in the ER with some wheezing and the feeling of 'tightening' in the bottom of my neck. I'm 42F. After 5 days in hospital, they said it was possibly asthma and sent me home with a red and blue inhaler. Red inhaler 2 x puffs, 2 x a day forevermore.

Cut to 3 days before NYE, I start feeling the 'tightening' feeling again. Use the blue inhaler to no relief, other than severe jitteryness trying to get the right dose to open the tightening. I called the Dr, who prescribed prednisolone tablets and said to keep up with my inhalers. Tightening is now going away and coming back and has been doing so for the last 5 days. Blue inhaler isn't easing things. I'm concerned it isn't asthma as others describe breathlessness - mine is that my airway is tightening near the thyroid gland.
I get tired instantly when the tightness comes on, then I develop a headache.
No stress or anxiety causes it, it just comes on at random times.
I check my C02 when they come on and it seems fine. Does this sound like asthma to any of you? Do you feel like whatever it is behind your thyroid gland is closing up?

I'm exhausted with all this üòî

Thank you in advance."

"I am currently on prednisone for an asthma exacerbation. It‚Äôs already better, but my chest still hurts and sometimes I feel breathless. Have you ever had long exacerbations? For me it‚Äôs the first one that is taking very long"
" 

‚ÄãI am increasingly convinced that steroid inhalers create a dependency and¬† are somewhat of a catch 22, the more you take them the more¬†you will need them. ‚Äã I'm interested to hear others experiences of tapering down their inhaled steroid inhalers. My experience of tapering down dosages gradually is that there is an exacerbation/flare up immediately following the dose reduction, which will eventually die down after a few days/weeks. This makes me believe that the steroid inhalers withdrawal cause asthma flare ups which makes it very hard to break the cycle. It 's well known that topical steroids create a dependency and withdrawal flare ups and it seems highly plausible to me that inhaled steroids might create the same issues.¬†¬†

I've experimented on myself somewhat. Over the course of a year I have dropped my Beclomethasone dosage from \*2000mcg per day all the way down to 250mcg per day. That's an almost¬† 90% reduction by gradually tapering. The flare ups after each taper are uncomfortable but manageable. I would only ever taper down roughly 100/50mcg less each time across a days dosing, so 1000mcg to 900mcg for example and then stay at that level until the exacerbation stabilised for a number of weeks before dropping again. I wouldn't say it's easy, trying to continue on the experiment during the initial flare ups isn't fun and the temptation to just maintain at the level and not drop is constantly present. But I'm very pleased with my results. I know there are many types of asthma out there and this may not be possible for all but I'm interested to hear if anyone else has either tried this or also suspects their inhaled steroids dependency is causing more problems than they are solving.

\* - my 2000mcg beclomethasone¬†number is taking 'fostair 200' four puffs a day. Fostair inhalers and a few other brands such as QVar¬†have extra fine¬†particles. The manufacturer states that 100 micrograms of extrafine beclomethasone in these preparations is equivalent to 250 micrograms of beclomethasone in a non-extrafine formulation. 'Fostair 200' provides and equivalent¬† of 500mcg of beclomethasone¬†per puff when compared to standard non fine particulate¬†inhalers.¬†"
"It stops moving as the 20 mark approaches the red zero but it doesn't complete its cycle and I'm left wondering whether there's more doses left or not, it's not cheap so I can't risk leaving unused doses on it but last week I was choking and I took like 8 doses before I realized it probably ran out a day ago...
I've been trying to keep track of the doses I take on a post it note but I've already messed up the count I think, idfk you'd think for such an expensive medication they'd bother putting a decent counter.."

So starting Sunday I noticed my asthma was acting up a bit and started taking my inhaler more. Well fast forward to now (3:40am wed) and I can‚Äôt even sleep through the night without waking up every other hour coughing/ wheezing and taking my rescue inhaler. I also started taking my nebulizer during the day every few hrs. I‚Äôm starting to worry. I took Benadryl and allergy meds earlier and they dont seem  to be helping when they normally would. üò≥ only things I can think is that I was over a friends house who has a cat 3 days in a row (t/f/s) for a bit each day and I‚Äôm pretty allergic but idk why it would be affecting me this bad 3 days after?? I also had covid about a week ago. And I was an idiot and was hitting a nicotine vape a lot f/s nights.  Im scared what I may have done to myself. I‚Äôm gonna call my dr in the morning and don‚Äôt want to go on a steroid but idk what else my dr will say. Currently worried tho bc I can‚Äôt seem to get this under control when I normally can. It‚Äôs 3:40 am I shouldn‚Äôt be awake and wheezing rn üò≠

"Hi everyone, 

I have had self diagnosed exercise induced asthma for 5 years or so. If I run in the cold my lungs get tight and I cough up a lot of thick mucus. It resolves in a day or so and rarely happens. I have post traumatic headaches so started using cannabis again. I‚Äôve smoked weed on and off for many years with no lung issues at all. I bought a Pax 3 dry herb vape to be healthier (or so I thought)  and used it off and on for a year. My headaches got worse so I started vaping more consistently. A few times after vaping my lungs burned and I felt short of breath. This lasted for 1 day the first time. Got better. Second time it lasted for 10 days. I stopped smoking and vaping for a month. I vaped again a month later and the lung burning/shortness of breath has stuck around for 6 months. I quit smoking and vaping this entire time. I had a clear lung CT, clear chest x ray, and normal PFT since this started. I went back to my primary and he thinks it‚Äôs uncontrolled asthma. He gave me Pulmicort but I am holding off on using it since Covid is crazy right now and I‚Äôm worried about pneumonia and immune suppression. Has anyone had asthma that feels like steady lung irritation for an extended period of time? I always thought of asthma being more episodic. Thanks!"

"Good morning, 

I have a 10 year old daughter who has begun to complain about feeling ""like she cant breathe well"".  She can only describe her episodes as her check feels weird when she breathes in and it is hard to breathe out.  At first I thought maybe it was anxiety, but it is becoming more frequent and in situations where there is no reason for her to be anxious (i.e. just playing on her tablet).  

I would describe her experiences as very mild, but I don't want to ignore the symptoms as they seem to be happening more frequently.  I am just curious of the experiences of parents whose children have been diagnosed with mild asthma, what lead to your child's diagnosis?"

Stuck in throat and it constantly makes me want to swallow in an attempt to clear it. I have taken my inhaler twice, currently taking montelukast, tried a steamy shower/salt water gargling and none of it has been successful.

I wanted to add that I had extremely spicy food yesterday, and began to feel short of breath last night. I'm thinking acid reflux is a possibility but considering I got barely any sleep and inhalers don't seem to be working should I head to the ER?"

"Hey, all! I developed asthma about 4 years ago after going into anaphylactic shock from a bee sting.

I live in the Pacific Northwest, so it‚Äôs kinda miserable, but for the most part, I‚Äôve kept it in check. 

Until recently. I had work done on my attic 1.5 mos ago, and I believe that it released a ton of fiberglass into my bedroom and caused mold to grow. My asthma flared so much in the house, and particularly in my bedroom, that I had to stay in a hotel‚ÄîI had consistent SOB despite allergy meds + my rescue inhaler.

-First of all i used to love it because it was using dry powder. I still hate MDI cause I find them unreliable without an aerochamber. I love the fact that i could use a DPI whenever I wanted without worrying that I‚Äôm not gonna recive the full dose. My problem now is with the powder itself. I cannot use it without using a nebulizer beforehand because it‚Äôs making me cough like crazy also it‚Äôs giving me a dry throat. And the device is starting to act on me. Sometimes it would load up making a click sometimes it wont. I just dont like it anymore and it‚Äôs not efficient.

"I am 34, i have just been diagnosed with asthma. Ive always had severe coughing after smelling smoke, perfumes, etc but all the CT scans they did and the breathing tests were 'normal' all those years.

In the last year i gained so much weight, im sitting home all day.. Two months ago i started having attacks that felt like dyspnea. My oxygen also dropped. At first i was given antihistamines but didnt help. I have severe acid reflux, so i was given pantoprazole, but didnt help that much.. My attacks happened when i ate too much, or when i got stressed a lot or shouted (im an angry person), or at night. I wake up with nightmares and breathing fast and the whole package. So, my dads lung specialist said its asthma, probably because of my acid reflux all those years, and my 30 kilos weight gain. I dont wheeze, i dont have the very 'classic' symptoms.

"Hi, 

so as the title says, my question is about Asthma control. To be more percise, I'd like to know what good Asthma control actually means.

I got diagnosed with Asthma last summer and have been on a preventer (Fostair) and a reliever (Salbutamol) since. Reliever use decreased significantly after the Fostair really took effect (after about a month) and my Asthma has been pretty well controled so far. 
Except for one major exacerbation recently. 
I was just getting ready for bed, I had been watching a movie and munching tortillas until quite late at night (I think it was around 11 p. m.) I noticed a slight wheeze. I ignored it at first, because a tiny bit of a wheeze is quite common for me and most of the time goes away on its own.
It didn't that time, so I took my Salbutamol (the regular two puffs) and waited a few minutes. 
The chest tightness and wheezing did not disappear, even got worse. So I took another two puffs of Salbutamol and waited. Things however, still progressed and I took another four puffs of my Salbutamol. At that point I was relly scared and thought about calling 911. After my reliever still not working I took four puffs of Combivent (Ipratroprium Bromide + Fenoterol) I had lying around, which finally ended the Attack. Of course I was shaking massively and I could not sleep for the rest of the night. 

So back to my question. From what I have read this single incident would mean bad asthma control and the need for a change in my treatment. Is that true?

Also should I have called an ambulance? I was thinking about that and just barely got the attack under control before doing so. But when is the point I should call for help and how do I know I am at that point?

Obviously I know I should talk to my pulmonologist, which I will do, however my next appointment (due to the pandemic) isn't until February."

"I got my first dose of Pfizer today, and I feel like my chest is a bit congested. Did anyone else feel the same way?"
"So I had asthma as a child, but it went away after a few years and only recently have I been experiencing breathing issues (I'm 26). I am only experiencing breathing troubles once every two months or so, but these attacks last 2 or 3 days. They always start late at night, and the only symptom I really have is struggling to catch my breath (no wheezing). I can still breathe in deep, but it's like I can't get a satisfying breath out of it most of the time. 

The weird part about it is that if I am distracted with something, in a conversation, or doing light physical activity, my breathing actually improves. I'm very confused on if this is asthma or just anxiety I am experiencing. I do not smoke but live with smokers, I have also used my o2 oxygen reader and I am at a steady 98-99% all the time.

 Any ideas?"
"you would think being set the beach,  people smoking shouldn't bother me. i was down wind from 2 dudes that started smoking after we pit down our chairs and stuff. I smelled the furst whiff quickly, looking around for the source. 30 yards upwind there they were. i had to move my chair farther up the shoreline to stay out of their wind. I doubt want to have to move the entire family.  I am very sensitive to cigarette smoke and immediately got short of breath. Asthma and smokers suck."

My pulminologist has put me on Brio Elipta after Symbicort was giving me issues.  The issue is that after being on Symbicort for 2 weeks it feels like my asthma has gotten worse so I'm a little concerned trying Brio.   Does anyone have any experiences with Brio Elipta?   Does anyone else have experiences of their asthma getting worse after using a steroid inhaler?
"I had my first dose yesterday. I do feel like I noticed my coughing lessen \[was a mess beforehand yesterday, it was constant\], but by the time I went to bed I was having a massive, life-ruining headache. I even woke up and struggled to go back to sleep because the headache was following me even in bed. My blood pressure was up, but not enough in my mind to be the cause of said headache and might of in fact resulted from said headache and lack of sleep.

I've seen that headaches might improve within a week or so of being on montelukast, but this was so terrible I'm not sure if it's even worth it to suffer through it that long, and some of the other things I'm seeing about mental health issues/depression/suicidal thoughts scare the bejeezus out of me.

What are your experiences with montelukast? I'll definitely be consulting my doc about this but in the meantime was curious."

"My asthma:

I got asthma when i was 4 months and it was very severe. My parents called 911 every month for the first the first 5 years of my life. My parents have told me that i was close to dying a couple of times where doctors had to be by my side in the ambulance when i got transfered from different hospitals. 

When i was around 9 i could controle the asthma with medication without any severe attacks. 

When i was 16 the asthma was almost gone and i wanted to join the army but got rejected because of my asthma. Even tho i still was medicated i told my doctor that i didnt take the medication anymore and he wrote in my journal that my asthma was gone. I join the army and everything was great.

When i was 20 i started getting small asthma attacks again but didnt have any medication for it(justice for being stupid). But it wasnt something fresh air couldnt cure.

Now im 26 and in the shape of my life but im starting to get severe attacks again.

"Thanksgiving weekend I got sick with RSV. It turned into bronchitis and a full blown asthma flare up where I went to the ER SEVERAL times because I couldn't breathe. 

Little did I know RSV also made my GERD worse. Which in turn made my asthma worse on top of the infection. 

I was put on prednisone twice, a nebulizer, increased my maintenance inhaler, and was put on antibiotics. 

I finally started feeling better with the coughing and chest phlegm a week ago. But I was still having a cough, shortness of breath, and couldn't go more than 4 hours without the nebulizer. 

I visited my doctor who we agreed to finally try singulair. We also discussed my GERD which had gotten so bad I actually thought at one point it was a heart attack. 

So he switched my PPI. 

A few days after being on singulair and the new PPI and I can FINALLY go 8 hours without the neb. A HUGE improvement. 

I still get winded going up and down stairs, and can't walk far like at a grocery store. 

But HUGE improvement still."

"My mom is currently making a cat scratcher with sisal rope. It's already caused an asthma attack, and I'm wondering if anyone else's asthma is triggered by sisal, and if it'll quiet down once we stop handling it and sending those fine fibers/dust into the air. I tried searching for info on sisal as an allergy trigger, but most of the links I saw were suggesting it as a hypoallergenic alternative for carpeting.

If you have reactions to sisal, what alternatives do you use for things like cat scratchers? Or do you find that it's less of a problem as long as you aren't handling it?"
"I decided to make this post with the hope of finding out if anyone else has similar issues. 

At the beginning of the pandemic, I almost died from Covid and was bedridden for about 2 to 3 months. 

The fever subsided in 2 weeks, but I was afflicted with extreme fatigue, difficulty breathing (especially in the morning), occasional shortness of breath, etc for the rest of the few months. 

I got my energy back when I began to take vitamin supplements and felt even healthier than I had always been prior to being sick. 

However, around October 2020, I suddenly got knocked out right in the middle of a conversation when I was talking to my girlfriend who was smoking on the balcony, and fell asleep for 12 hours or even longer (she quit smoking ever since).

She had always been smoking next to me before that, but that was my first time suddenly falling asleep in response to the exposure to the smell of cigarette. After that, I started showing symptoms similar to the ones of Allergic Asthma whenever I got exposed to cigarette smoke, and they seemed to have gotten worse and worse. 

Now, I can detect a smell of cigarettes faster than anyone, even if the smoker is really far away, and once I get exposed to it, symptoms usually kick in a day later, starting with sleepiness, and then asthmatic symptoms. Sometimes, I get a stomachache. Those symptoms last for days, usually.

The more amount of cigarette smoke I get exposed to, the worse the severity of those symptoms gets. I have been doing my best to avoid it, so I have only been exposed to a small amount. That actually scares me to think what would happen, if I directly got hit by cigarette smoke. 

Another thing, I noticed about my condition is that I can jog for a while. And when I was doing it on a daily basis, my lung capacity was significantly improving. I had to stop, because, one day, when I was running, a guy walked past me smoking, and I got severe symptoms next day. 

With that said, I don't seem to get those symptoms after working out or jogging. Exercising seems to help me feel better. The only thing that activates those symptoms are cigarette smoke and vape cloud. 

I seemed to have developed allergies to my dog's saliva and chocolate after I got sick from the virus, but they faded away eventually. 

Do any of you have a similar condition?"
"Hey gang so yeah the gist of it is I have been diagnosed with asthma and a panic disorder which is just a lovely combo. 

So right now I am taking pantoprazole, breo (relvar) ellipta 184/22 as well as srivasso (spiriva) 18 mcg daily and my doc told me to use a salbutamol reliever if needed. For my panic disorder I am scheduled for a therapist, but that's in January at the earliest.

 Yesterday evening I felt sort of like I was in 'manual breathing mode' if that makes any sense. So I could breathe fairly fine, no wheezing/coughing but it just feels like I am more aware of every breath I take. This went on for hours and at 2am I finally took the salbutamol reliever for the first time which I haven't ever used before. I didn't feel like it had a noticeable impact but fell asleep regardless. 

This morning I woke up and almost immediatly had the feeling again, again no wheezzing or coughing  or not even a feeling of tightness around the chest per se. Just this feeling of 'laboured breathing' where I consciously need to take breaths and felt a little dizzy. at 11am (2 hours ago) I took my second puff of the reliever but it doesn't seem to do much as I still have this feeling. I have a pulse oximeter and oxygen sats are always around 97/98.

&amp;#x200B;

 So yeah now I am pondering going to the ER but I'm sorta scared to go. What do you guys say?

"I hate asthma. After about 2 years of being pretty well controlled, a minor little cold that gave the rest of my family the sniffles has me wheezing and coughing up phlegm.

But my question is, for those of you that experience the same thing when you have a cold, do you find yourself trying to constantly cough it out or do you just deal with the wheezing? I wonder if I‚Äôm trying to cough stuff up too much and if I just need to let myself wheeze until I feel it loose enough to get out. The wheezing is annoying, but maybe I just need to learn to live with it so long as I‚Äôm getting enough O2 (which my sats are fine).

Any advice?"
"If you take Singulair, please read this criminally delayed FDA warning about an increased risk of depression, suicidal ideation, and other similar side effects.

"I have recently been diagnosed with asthma. My doctor only prescribed me a rescue bronchodilator inhaler, but no maintenance inhaler. For the past few days, I have had moments where I feel short of breath at rest and then it goes away on its own. I was wondering if others experience this, or if maybe something else is going on? When you have asthma flare ups does your shortness of breath always continue to get worse without medications or does it sometimes go away as I‚Äôm describing?"

"I‚Äôve been on singular for two weeks. It‚Äôs been amazing for my breathing. Prior to it I was using my rescue inhaler and still needing my nebulizer daily. However, the side effects are terrible. I feel sedated most of the time and the dreams are SO vivid and consistent. I can manage that. It‚Äôs the constant brain fog though that‚Äôs destroying me. Prior to starting the med I had low level brain fog due to multiple concussions but this makes me feel like I‚Äôm a 90 year old mental patient. I‚Äôm not sure how much more I can take to be honest. Has anyone else suffered from the brain fog ?"
"Hello All,

I was diagnosed with asthma about 7 years ago at age of 35. Never had a hint of breathing issues before. Now it plagues me all the time and I have so many drugs. I end up on Prednisone several times a year. I can't seem to pend down how to keep it under control. 

Any advice? 

Mostly I am trying to determine what triggers my asthma so I can either prevent it or plan accordingly. I think it may be tied to the weather ( I live in Minnesota) 

Does anyone know of any good apps to help track your symptoms? I tried Doppler and I am not a fan."
Hi y‚Äôall! What are your thoughts of flutter devices? Is it worth it and are you seeing any benefits? Thanks
"Some background: I am currently off any controller since I need to get tested for steroid allergies before I can maybe hopefully be put back on again. My appointment at the allergy clinic isn't until mid-January, though, and I've been off my fluticasone for a month now (used to take 2x 250 micrograms daily). I've also had an allergic reaction to Montelukast so that's out as well. I'm not looking for medical advice but for personal ""this helps me"" accounts.

What I'm already doing: I take my rescue (salbutamol) before going to bed and after waking up, I air out the bedroom right before going to bed, and I sleep with a HEPA filter running all night. Our mattress, pillows, blankets are all encased in dust mite encasings, and all our clothes are stored in plastic boxes. Bedroom is properly cleaned regularly at least once a week, and my dust mite allergy is doing just fine in there.

My problem: Despite all the measures I'm taking, I've been struggling to get enough sleep lately, and I've been waking up with laboured breathing and a tight chest. This morning, my peak flow was unusually low for me after my asthma had woken me up after less than five and a half hours of sleep. My asthma is out of control without my maintenance steroid, I know that, my doc knows that, there's just not much we can do about that right now. So anything else that helps you to keep your asthma at bay over night and in the mornings? I'm just trying to see whether there are any ideas I haven't yet thought of and tried, anything that might make this time a little easier and make me need my rescue a little less often (as I'm afraid it might start messing with my heart if I take it too much since a LABA last year sent me to the ER and then cardiologist check-ups due to bad side effects)."

"First a little bit of back story: I've had asthma since I was born. It was pretty bad when I was small, but it has been improving ever since. Now I'm ""fine"": no major attacks, ocasional use of the inhaler, no biggy. However, I've had asthma all my life, and I'll have it until I die. I'm used to it, it doesn't excessively interfere on my day-to-day.

Occasionally, once every month or so, I'll just be chillin' and, out of the blue, I'll take such an amazing breath that I'll almost get high from the oxygen. I feel my chest expanding as it never has. I literally visualize my lungs filling every single pore with air. A flash flood throughout my body. Like if my lungs were ""wtf is asthma?"" for a single breath, just to immediately continue with my usual shitty breathing. I am so used to my normal breathing that it freaks me out each time it happens. Do non asthmatics breath like this 24/7???? That must be.... well... great. I wish I could control those amazing breaths. But I can't. I limit myself to enjoy them.

Just a small thought. Have a nice day :)"

Iv always been on 2 puffs morning and night with a preventer but last year I had a flare up and since the whole year had shortness of breath that comes and goes but I went up to 4 in morning and night for another flare up and my breathing issue went not completely but helped. Then I stayed on for a week and was fine no side effects but I then went back and shortness of breath came back. I thought of just staying on 4 iv not been told to or prescribed it idk what to do tho I either stay on 4 or go to 2.

"I‚Äôm sure this will get removed but I‚Äôm in a bitchy mood, and I have to say it: is anyone else just SO sick and tired of the smokers on here with asthma? The asthma forum on here is flooded with people asking the same dumb question over and over - is it ok if I smoke even though I have asthma? Is it ok to smoke weed, vape etc even though I have severe asthma and I‚Äôm coughing up black phlegm from the pits of hell everyday? 

I get that these *idiots* are just looking for validation and some other dipshit will no doubt come along and tell them how great they feel despite smoking, but ugh‚Ä¶ it just hurts my soul a little bit to read these same posts. 

I try and do everything I can to control and manage my asthma so that I can feel hopefully, slightly normal, and then these idiots are just smoking every day like it‚Äôs no big deal. 

I personally hate smoking and find it very triggering. The worse is when I‚Äôm walking behind someone and it‚Äôs a busy street and I can‚Äôt get away from them and they blow all that nasty smoke back to me. It brings on an instant coughing fit and chest tightness. Second hand smoke is a nightmare.

It doesn't feel increases by deep breaths but I have this odd sense that it is the right lung. 

It's not a sharp pain but just enough to want to reach to it and then it's gone.

This breathing issue carried on, I couldn't finish sentences, struggling to walk. Couldn't exercise.
Doctor diagnoses asthma and proceeds to treat, although badly to begin with. 
It helps a bit and doesn't. Had the usual antibiotics, steroids, inhalers etc.
Never had spirometry testing. Two lung x-rays all clear.
Since it all began I have to spend up to 3 hours a day coughing phlegm out of my lungs.
I'm onto the third doctor now because she listened to my chest and didn't think it sounded like asthma. Not exercise induced, not worse at night etc. She's going to do spirometry for me and take it from there.
I'm so exhausted and at the point of tears with this new life. 
I've started doing more cardio but I'm worried about the future because of my breathing issues.
I'm worried it's not asthma and something else is going on.
Using steroid inhalers as preventors does nothing. Albuterol does nothing.
Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice/info to take to the docs when I inevitably end up back there would be gratefully received"

Hey there! So long story short after getting covid(fully vaxxed tho) I developed asthma. I‚Äôve been smoking since I was 12 now im 16 and i‚Äôve always had problems with my respiratory tract. I quit smoking 1 month and 4 days ago. My pulmonologist said that it may be a combination between smoking/genetics/covid. I‚Äôve been taking my symbicort/montelukast  for about 2 weeks now and i dont have any flares throughout the day. I used to take Lithium for my bipolar disorder a while ago and in these 2 weeks i‚Äôve felt like my world was about to fail. I cannot describe how miserable I feel for some reason. So my question is: What was your experience smoking on asthma? I just want to smoke one cig but i‚Äôm afraid that it would trigger another asthma attack

"I was diagnosed with asthma at 5yrs old and I'm now 31. 
When I have an asthma attack it very rarely wheeze. The problem is it makes it very difficult for doctors to take it seriously.

Last time I went to hospital I was sick with a cold and as usual my asthma went into overdrive. I was constantly taking my rescue inhaler but I was still struggling to breathe. 
The doctor checking on me initially said they couldn't hear an audible wheeze so they weren't too concerned. Meanwhile as my body was getting more and more tired trying to shift air, I instead end up taking shallower and shallower breaths. 

Does anyone else have this type of asthma?"
"Hey! High school teen here asking dear advice. 

As long as I remember, I‚Äôve always had like minor minor asthma attacks after some exercises since I was little ( again, not so serious ones ). But recently, things got little out of control; I can feel tightness in my chest. I pretty much sort of gasp for air daily basis and it is annoying the world out of me. I am not obsessed by all means or have any other medical conditions. Inhalers don‚Äôt seem to help that much. I don‚Äôt know if this is a temporary thing that will go away or if it is something I should take some actions. This is embarrassing but I do feel scared af sometimes. Thank you!"
"In November 2020 I was exposed to a high level of a chemical irritant and my respiratory system hadn‚Äôt since been the same. 
Im taking advair 200/50 twice a day, singular and have even tried antihistamine nose sprays, but nothing seems to make my symptoms go away completely. I wheeze every single day, especially while I‚Äôm in bed at night. 
I constantly am clearing my throat and coughing up mucous. I‚Äôve never had issues like this before but now I‚Äôm dealing with these chronic symptoms, as well as a dry cough that doesn‚Äôt go away and sounds unlike a cough I‚Äôve ever had before in my life. My airways are constantly inflamed and I‚Äôm not sure how to make it stop. Abuterol definitely helps with the wheezing. 
Im a very fit person, cardiovascularly speaking, and it doesn‚Äôt really seem like much has changed in terms of my
Lung breathing capabilities/capacity. 

Im posting to see if anyone here has gotten asthma from occupational hazards/irritants and to see if you‚Äôve been able to manage your symptoms. Revisiting my doctor next week - I‚Äôm really just feeling hopeless and looking for success stories instead of ppl telling me to see Dr. thanks."

I have pretty bad asthma. I take symbicort and have a rescue inhaler. I guess I was wondering is there a asthma treatment that is the strongest? Like the last line of defense that almost always works?
"I'm pretty sure I had an asthma attack after a sport match, I wasn't really able to talk, my chest felt tight, I was hitting my chest for air and felt like fainting. My coach asked me if I wanted an ambulance and if I had asthma, I really don't know tbh with Covid going to the hospital isn't really easy and there's so many patients so I don't want to make it more difficult.

I don't have any medications so I kind of just deal with it, or try to not care too much when on a daily basis sometimes I can't talk or just walking feels so difficult. Dealing with it means being sick for 1 day or 2 (normally just the evening-night if it's not serious), that day I went out with a friend and I felt sick all day long and had a hard time sleeping. 
In winter, the cold air makes my lungs/chest feel tight(?) and I'm quite prone to having colds and severe coughing (a whole month coughing, or coughing till vomiting and not sleeping) but I have always atribuited my symptoms to just having colds. 

I always think of my symptoms as not really important (been like this since childhood), but I know that it's damaging my health. Should I get it check out or its not much of a deal?"

"My 4yo daughter has recently started getting asthma, caused by the common cold.

Looking at websites like aafa, I see that asthma seems to be more prevelant in certain cities more than others.

We have been intending to move anyway, so I was wondering if it would be better to look for a less asthmatic city.

However, recognizing that the asthma is being caused by the common cold, I wonder if moving will make a difference at all, since the common cold appears everywhere, including the warmer cities."

"I'll try to summarize briefly: never had an asthma attack until I was 33, caused by exposure to an irritant, which was handled well by albuterol and a quick prednisone taper. This happened once a year until 2020, always a clear irritant. Then I had my first 1.5 mile run after not running in a while in 2020 on a cool day, and had exercise-induced asthma for the first time. Got serious about things and started using a controller like it was my new religion: went from QVar (not much effect) to Symbicort (decent improvement, but not as good as my doctor or I hoped, and the formoterol side effects were not missed) and finally Trelegy Ellipta (200), which I've been on for most of 2021 that finally got me symptom free. Not quite top marks on a PFT, and I wouldn't care to go running on a winter day, but I was even able to exercise vigorously again without issue. It was working so well that my doc and I were in talks about 10 days ago about tapering down.

Then it happened: cheat tightness last Monday. It doesn't go away. Sometimes it's higher, sometimes its lower, sometimes it seems there's a bit of phlegm, sometimes dry and burning. Albuterol only helps a small amount. My home PEF/FEV1 meter show pretty much the same results I had even when I was symptom free. No fever, no cough, no wheezing, and indoor exercise doesn't make it worse. It was also 3 or 4 days after my COVID booster.

My PCP and Pulmonogist said not to worry about it given as I've been describing it, use thr Albuterol, and give it some time to go away by itself. Maybe this is all normal among you guys, and I'd like to hear your experiences. (Don't worry, I am also going to see another pulmnologist for a second opinion). The fact that I have already been hitting this with the triple cocktail (ICS, LABA, and LAMA) for many months and it's not enough right now has me very nervous."
"Hi, 
I got diagnosed with Asthma (mostly Exercise Induced) last summer. However, from what I've read (and experienced up until now) is that symptoms usually set off after at least several minutes of (mostly vigurous) exercise, like sprinting. 
However lately I'm like getting a full on attack after only mere minutes of doing something, like sprinting to catch a train, after which I sit there, gasping for air like some maniac. My reliever has helped in these situations, but I really don't want to overuse it.
Up until now I used to be in perfect shape and have dabbled in lots of different sports, biking, swimming, tennis, horse back riding, fencing, you name it. 
I haven't had a problem until April of this year, after having had a bad chest infection. 
Anyone any idea what could be causing this? I suspect it might be the cold air, as there shouldn't be any allergens around outside this time of year and so far I haven't been known to be allergic to anything. But then again, is EIA normal to be set off so quickly?"
"I have allergic asthma, for which I use a preventer inhalator, and a hiatal hernia. Until about 10 months, my GERD only caused heartburn, but recently I detected that my GERD is also causing me asthma symptoms, mainly dyspnea and sputum. I wake up during the night with the sensation of having to yawn. Sometimes I am able to yawn satisfactorily, sometimes I don‚Äôt, and my asthma symptoms are not easy to manage anymore.

I am thinking of undergoing surgery to fix the hiatal hernia and my GERD.

What are your symptoms? Have you thought of GERD surgery?"
I've seen a couple posts at least about flare ups at night... After I talked to my doctor I was informed that during sleep you body produces less of the chemicals that inhibit inflation. I do use a controller before bed sometimes and it started to help me from waking up and midnight with difficulties breathing. If this is what you are experiencing then go see your doctor! I hope this helps some of you.

"I know I literally just posted here but i need some help lol. Basically the title. but if you want a more in depth explanation, see below. tldr: had an asthma attack on Tuesday, can't get a doctors appointment until next year, what the hell am i supposed to do? I've had asthma my entire life. 


long version:


So I had an asthma attack on Tuesday. It was my first in 7 years. I've had asthma my entire life (21 years). I believe it was triggered by a combination of having someone around in my home covered in cat hair and dander which I am severely allergic to, running the 20 year old heating system in my home that is def covered in mold and who knows what else, and finally the ever changing terrible weather of Texas. 


Welp, on advice of my doctor, I'm taking nebulizer treatments with abuterol every 4 hours and trying to up it by an hour everyday. Yesterday it was 5 hours, but today my asthma has gotten worse and I had to downgrade it to 4 again. Like the title says, I can't get an actual doctor's appointment until next year. They're apparently booked until mid January. Awesome, I know.


So im wondering: until then, how am I supposed to deal with this? It's bad, but not bad enough to warrant an ER or urgent care visit fortunately. I found that a hot cup of coffee takes away my asthma symptoms for at least an hour, but then it wears off and suddenly I'm out of breath again. I've also found hot showers and hot drinks in general help a lot as well as isolating myself in my room away from everything. I'm already on symbicort, Singulair, zyzal, fish oil, and magnesium which were all prescribed. I also have a rescue inhaler with levabuterol and my nebulizer is abuterol. I'm not sure what else I can possibly do."
"I didn‚Äôt get enough sleep for 2 weeks and got pretty sick for 10 days. The past 2 months have been stressful, too. I get really sick if I don‚Äôt sleep enough. I used to have bad asthma but then it regressed in adolescence. I‚Äôm an adult now and it seems to be coming back.

 The problem is this:

 It‚Äôs been 1.5 months and I still have a wheeze and shortness of breath. I didn‚Äôt have COVID-19, tested negative many times, and I have a booster. I‚Äôll admit getting adequate sleep is a problem still, and I need to get back into exercising more since I‚Äôm on an exercise dry spell.

Is this normal? If not, what do you recommend? Does sleep and exercise really help a lot? I never encountered these issues previously regardless of exercise dry spells or lack of sleep and my asthma used to be almost nonexistent."
"Hey gang, so since pretty much a week I've been prescribed relvar (breo) ellipta 184/22 for my asthma, and since about that time I have noticed that my BP values are starting to climb.

"My 5yr old son has been in hospital and icu since Friday night. He had RSV and has a history of asthma. He is on 8 puffs of ventolin every 2 hours. They‚Äôre saying his lower airways are closed and his oxygen levels have been anywhere from 89-97 but usually around 91-94. Every time they give the puffer his oxygen drops. They listen to his lungs before the puffers and they said he sounds great (especially when we try to stretch it 3-4 hours before ventolin). After the ventolin they say they hear wheezing and oxygen levels drop. They keep saying his airways open with ventolin and then the oxygen goes there but it‚Äôs been 5 days no and no improvement. 

He‚Äôs had rsv since last Monday. So he‚Äôs 1.5 weeks into it.

My asthma is so bad that just GETTING OUT OF MY CAR TO PUMP GAS is triggering my asthma. My chest is locking up, wheezing, fatigue. I‚Äôm so oxygen starved that when I get my albuterol I start shaking and hyperventilating for a while. I am on an ungodly amount of steroids to strengthen my lungs and NOTHING. IS. WORKING. 

Am I just going to die? My house is the only place that‚Äôs warm enough to not trigger asthma.

"My almost two year old son recently got diagnosed with asthma. I have it also so I‚Äôm familiar with treatment. 

My question is for any parents with experience who can offer advise for helping him during an asthma attack. He hates the nebulizer and mask, even though it‚Äôs one of the small, handheld, almost silent ones. When he‚Äôs having an asthma attack we have to literally pin him down (it takes two of us) and even then it‚Äôs incredibly hard to keep the mask up to his face (no way we can get it on him).

He screams his head off the whole time which obviously does not help him calm his breathing. I stay calm as possible throughout to help him see it‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of but I‚Äôm feeling totally helpless

Currently the only way to give him is maintenance meds is when he‚Äôs sleeping.

I‚Äôve tried using the mask myself in front of him, letting him hold it, having his 5 year old brother wear it, putting it on his lovey and nope, he‚Äôs just not having it.

Any advise gladly taken, I just want to be able to help him when he needs me most :("

"Can you have an awesome full pulsar function test and still have asthma? I have been suffering asthma like symptoms and went for a full lung fibrin test with spirometry, lung volumn and diffusion and passed with flying colors.  Can I still have asthma?"

It's been 3 weeks since I've exercised and I'm going INSANE."
"Had an asthma attack which led to a panic attack, which lead to even more asthma issues and now I'm just trying to calm down. My nebulizer treatments make my heart rate skyrocket too, so that didn't help at all.

Hello asthma community,

I've started a blog series which will explore the rise of modern disorders such as food allergies, IBS, eczema and asthma.

As someone grappling some of those disorders, this blog series will follow my story as I try to figure out what went wrong and how I can fix myself - all the while exploring why these disorders are increasingly prevalent.

It is written in a light-hearted style, in an attempt to keep it engaging.

Do give it a read. I would really appreciate your thoughts and shared stories as the blog progresses.

Sending love in the meantime!

"In light of the surge in omicron in my area, I‚Äôm torn on whether it‚Äôs a good idea to travel for the holidays. I live in the mid-Atlantic region of the US and would be traveling by plane to Florida. I have asthma and my weight also puts me in a risk category for COVID. I also am vaxxed and boosted with Pfizer. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone similarly situated has any thoughts about the safety of holiday travel?"

"I moved from the northeast to the south about 14 years ago. With the move came what I original thought were fall/winter seasonal allergies causing asthma. I recently finally saw an allergist who helped me see that I'm only mildly allergy to some things I've never heard of, but not the heavy hitters for the area: ragweed, pine, or oak. Come to find out, it's the cold, dry air causing my annual problems.

Anyway, over the years I've tried Rx and OTC Flonase, Albuterol, Allegra-D, and Zyrtec and nothing really works. I was recently prescribed Singulair for the first time by a new PCP and have yet to take the first dose. So far, the only thing that's worked is wearing a non-medical N95 mask and a warm air humidifier. 

The PCP wants me to see an ENT specialist. The problem is that I have a high deductible health plan and about 2 grand to pay out of pocket before my insurance starts to pay anything. Two visits to the allergist has me owing over a grand and the PCP visit will cost another couple hundred. Is it worth it seeing an ENT, or should I just get used to wearing a mask and using a humidifier throughout the fall and winter each year?"
"Hey there! So i got diagnosed with asthma about 3 weeks ago and i got prescribed flixotide inhaler and some 3% saline water to nebulize. Long story short my body didn‚Äôt like flixotide and my attacks were getting worse and more frequently so i got put on Symbicort and Ventolin.
I love Symbicort and really helped me to manage my attacks but i still get (not as bad as they were) but still bad attacks. So im supposed to use my Ventolin inhaler but it is not working for some reason. I‚Äôve read online that it should work in about 10 minutes but when im using it, it feels like my attack is getting worse on the spot and after about an hour it starts to calm down.
 -Has anyone experienced this with ventolin? It is really annoying and im scared to use my symbicort as fast acting reliever"

"Okay so this may be a shot in the dark here but hear me out~ I‚Äôve been on singulair for over 15 years. I have really bad allergies and occasional asthma flare ups but nothing too bad. Come to find out after years of struggling with anxiety ,depression, ocd etc that singulair has been linked to causing mental illnesses. Even so much that it has a black box warning. All I ask is if any of you have had any experience with this ? And if stopping singulair helped your mental health? Like I said I‚Äôve been on it 15 years. The damage may already be done."
"Hey all - I haven't been on here long, but I appreciate this community.  I've got asthma, and have had more problems in recent months with cooking oils &amp; related. I quit using olive oil to sautee, looked up the 'smoke point' on all cooking oils, &amp; found out that avocado oil has a considerably higher smoke point, so I bought some of that, but have been kind of scared to even try that with sauteeing - so I've mostly just used a little water.  Made some pancakes today for the first time in a few months, using some butter in an iron skillet, and it set me off.  Maybe I needed to have the heat lower, or maybe I need to try a tiny bit of the avocado oil.  Have any of you been through any of this?"
"I‚Äôm just curious if any of you have moved because your allergies/asthma are so bad? Was it better? Or was it only helpful for a short period of time? 

We live on Ky (the Ohio Valley) and I am so over it! I take Xolair, Singulair, Mucinex, Trelegy, Xyzal, Zyrtec and allergy shots. I finally hit the blue vial on my allergy injections and felt great until November hit. Now I am taking a 5 day course of prednisone because the mucus is so thick and my lungs burn constantly. I can‚Äôt get a allergy shot like this. I‚Äôm so frustrated with feeling terrible when I an so medicated with allergy meds.

We have talked about going West, but I have read on here that the wild fires can causes asthma patients issues as well. 

Any luck for any of you!? 
From one allergic asthma patient to another, thanks for your time!"

"Visited the doctor with symptoms of shortness of breath, and tight chest/mucus. She hypothesizes it's asthma after doing an EKG, X-Ray and allergy test. Apparently brought on by allergies (which apparently I have many, just never manifested... But still don't believe it). Does anyone have any experience in this? What will happen if i ignore it? I've never had to try an inhaler and it gets me annoyed I'll have to have another worry to add to my life."

"I‚Äôve pretty much dealt with cough variant asthma during the winter months for as long as I can remember. Once the air temp drops into the 30s, at some point in the following weeks, I develop a small, annoying and nagging dry cough. Then the irritation and mucus, and self-perpetuating coughing fits that follow. 

This year was particularly bad and my Qvar didn‚Äôt help control the cough at all. My doc switched me to Dulera and it worked like a charm. My cough improved within a day and was all but gone within 72 hours. 

The only downside so far has been ridiculous muscle spasms in my lats ‚Äî across my back and on top of my ribs under my arm. I feel like any small, random movement (grabbing a toothbrush, rolling over, etc.) has potential to cause a muscle to seize up and for me to double over in pain until it eventually releases. Sometimes it‚Äôs within seconds but there have been some bad ones. My second day on Dulera, I woke up with near-debilitating spasms that pretty much kept me from doing anything but working on my computer lying down. Several days of muscle relaxers got me back to even.

Has anyone else experienced this and/or has anyone found anything to help manage or eliminate these spasms? 

TIA!"
"I have asthma and allergies that flare due to many triggers and i currently have a glucorticoid nasal spray. I have a theory any help it could bring my allergies and asthma from the glucorticoid is negated by the synthetic chemical SCENT.  I need an over the counter nasal allergy spray preferably with a STEROID or GLUCORTICOID with NO SCENT to help me breathe and sleep at night, i am constantly in a zombie state and heavily reliant on caffeine to function.

 I ALREADY have a specialist appointment with a pulmonolgist in a few months but i need something to help me till then, again unscented. I try to reduce the things I am triggered by however, just staying away from my triggers is not really possible as I have so many of them unless i stay home 24/7.

TLDR; need recs for glucorticoid unscented nasal spray OTC.

thanks."

"My asthma‚Äôs been flaring up over the last few weeks after visiting family over Thanksgiving. Their house was dusty and it really aggravated my asthma when I was there. 

I was just put on prednisone, but have plans to fly to visit family over the holidays and stay in an Airbnb for a week. The Airbnb doesn‚Äôt have carpeting &amp; it has a no pets policy (I‚Äôm allergic to cats), but I‚Äôm not sure what the conditions will be like. I‚Äôm planning on bringing dust mite covers for the beds and am thinking about also picking up an air purifier. I‚Äôll also be on prednisone the whole time I‚Äôm there.

"So, I'm a long diagnosed asthmatic (18 yrs old diagnosed at ~10) my athsma atm is currently well controlled, very few symptoms can perform exercise like a normal person etc etc

However recently I've been having infrequent but long lasting episodes of fast heart rate and constant yawning with little breathing issues. My last GP Visit yesterday came with a normal blood pressure and heartbeat/breathing. And my last lung scan a week ago came clear

Is there anything I should be worrying about asthma wise or am I just hyper anxious."
"I just want to know if anyone can relate to this.  
My breathing issues are better some days and worse others. When I do manage to get it under control and almost breathe normally i honestly get a huge morale boost and.. Well feel powerful af. But then something makes it worse again, I spend more sleepless nights, struggle to breathe throughout the day and the stress is always so, so much unbearably worse and tends to manifest as less then pretty anger and fustration. I find it really hard to seek solutions knowing my life isn't generally in danger if I don't and that stress will invariably always come back. I do want to live my best life ofc but I don't know how to deal with the swings."

" 

I saw people post online 13 years ago about toxic laundry detergent, softeners, and dryer sheets.¬† After 13 years, we're still talking about it,¬†no laws ban it.¬† Our voices are too weak to be heard, or they do hear but they don't care.¬†¬†I¬†contacted¬†the American¬†Lung¬†Association; they replied to me that¬†they can't stop people from using scented laundry products.¬†¬†With such an¬†attitude, how they can protect people's lung health.¬†  


In fact, the artificial fragrances¬†in many of laundry products do not provide any cleaning benefit but do contribute to¬†asthma,¬†cancers,¬†migraine headaches, dizziness,¬†rashes, multiple chemical sensitivities, sinus allergies, and other respiratory illnesses.  


A study from Washington¬†State University¬†([https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723134438.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723134438.htm))¬†reveals that scented laundry detergents and dryer sheets are laced with two carcinogens such as benzene which¬†has¬†a¬†somewhat¬†sweet smell and acetaldehyde¬†both of¬†which the EPA says should not be inhaled¬†and¬†can raise your cancer risks.¬† Through the dryer vents, at high temperatures, the toxic chemicals are emitted¬†into the outside air, becoming even more lethal, even¬†if¬†we close¬†our windows,¬†the smells are still coming in and lingering in the air.¬†¬†  
We can pick up different¬†food,¬†but we have no choice but to share the same air, even it's lethal pollution.¬†People¬†have been inhaling¬†toxic chemicals for much of their lives.¬†¬†We are literally being poisoned and killed softly, slowly by these emitted chemical products.  
   
Workers in¬†factories¬†with¬†pollution have very¬†high cancer¬†rates.¬†Workers at¬†power plants,¬†chemical plants,¬†and¬†paper manufacturing plants commonly have liver cancer, blood cancer, lung cancer,¬†and¬†pancreatic cancer,¬†as well as other health issues.¬†¬†I believe¬†that¬†cancer rates in the laundry detergent¬†factories¬†must be very high too.  
Some people might think it's nothing, but they should understand that it really is a big deal.  
Please think about¬†all the¬†people getting sick¬†unnecessarily.¬†¬†Cancers, asthma, lung fibrosis,¬†and other¬†health issues could be prevented.¬†¬†Prevention is the important thing. Instead of¬†dealing with¬†these diseases,¬†often¬†not even knowing how we got them,¬†we should take¬†precautions as a society and rid¬†our neighborhoods and our world of these dangerous and unnecessary¬†chemicals.¬†  
   
Here is a link to¬†Dr. Anne Steinemann's website on this subject.¬†¬†[https://www.drsteinemann.com/home2.html](https://www.drsteinemann.com/home2.html)  Dr. Steinmann is Professor of Engineering at James Cook University, Australia, and Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Melbourne, Australia.¬† Hopefully, after you've¬†read what she writes,¬†you'll change your mind and fight back together.  
A bill should be sponsored that would restrict the use of scents in consumer¬†products (especially where they serve no purpose except cause health risks).¬†¬†  
In order to protect our environment and our health as well as our children's,¬†here¬†are two petition links. I¬†hope you can support signing so I don't feel I'm alone.

"Hi,

My asthma has been very poorly controlled for years, I am taking symbicort which stops asthma attacks but mostly rely on the blue inhalers to keep the breathlessness away. A couple of weeks ago I had an asthma review and was offered a more environmentally friendly blue inhaler which I agreed to. My old inhaler ran out and I picked up a new one yesterday - it looks exactly the same as the old ones, all the text on the canister is the same but it is offering me no relief whatsoever. I can see on the NHS app that my prescription changed a few days ago from ‚ÄòSalbutamol 100micrograms/dose inhaler CFC free‚Äô to ‚ÄòSalamol 100micrograms/dose inhaler CFC free (Teva UK Ltd)‚Äô but these sound like the same thing?!? I feel like I am going mad, it‚Äôs 5am and I‚Äôve been struggling to breathe since yesterday afternoon"

"Hi all!! Not asthmatic but rather a partner to someone who is asthmatic. My partner struggles with his feelings of reliance on his maintenance inhalers and worries about the long-term affects of the steroids. Recently, he saw a commercial for Dupixent injections which claims to be able to reduce or eliminate steroid use for asthma treatment in adults which sounds almost too good to be true. We of course intend to discuss with his pulmonologist to get their opinion as well but I‚Äôve always found the advice/experiences posted on this subreddit to be super helpful to me in trying to understand what my partner goes through so we‚Äôre also crowdsourcing it and would love to hear if anybody has any experience with this medication!"

"hey there! I got diagnosed with moderate asthma about a week ago after getting covid(i was fully vaxx btw) and my doctor prescribed me to nebulize Flixotide every 12 hours to treat my symptoms. But here‚Äôs where it got worse: After doing it for about 2 times, my symptoms got way way worse like i would have attacks 3-4 times a day it was unbearable so i stopped using it for a couple a days and continued to nebulize 3% saline water and things started to get better. But yesterday I thought to myself to try to do Flixotide again and right now im worse than ever. Has anyone ever experienced that??"

"went to a pulmonologist who confirmed I definitely don‚Äôt have restrictive lung disease, but also said he didn‚Äôt see signs of asthma and that gasping was not a symptom.

Well, it‚Äôs still been informative, nonetheless."

"I have eosinophilic asthma that was pretty well controlled until I caught RSV from my nephews a few months ago. As time went by, I steadily got worse and worse, with brief stints of steroids making me feel better, but not back to pre RSV control wise, and within 2 days of stopping the steroid bursts, I'm back to almost dying if I so much as walk 20 ft to my bathroom. Now, I also have sarcoidosis, but that next to never causes issues in my lungs, and when it does, it's usually only caught incidentally because I was never symptomatic with pulmonary involvement, only extrapulmonary. 

I had to go to the er last month because I just couldn't breathe well at work, a job I've been doing for 8 years. If I'm allowed to sit down for a couple of minutes, I can get my breathing under control. Naturally, I sat in the er for 30 minutes before being called back. My best friend's mom was with me because I felt like this time, I needed someone there. Boy was I right. They told me to change into a gown and they'd be right with me. Even changing got me severely short of breath, but it took them another 30 minutes to come back in and hook me up to machines to monitor me, by which time I had been sitting for long enough that I was able to catch my breath and the wheezes stopped. 

They took blood, left an iv start in my arm for just in case, then a higher than a nurse, lower than a physician's assistant came in. Listened to my lungs, decided I was fine. Didn't listen when I tried to tell her I couldn't get dressed without becoming short of breath, couldn't walk 10 feet without my oxygen dropping, I needed a nebulizer treatment. She just dismissed everything I said. All she had to do was have me walk to the door and back and check my o2 levels again to realize I was *not* ok, but she just brushed me off. I have a digital diary of my o2 levels going back to when I caught rsv, showing that my o2 drops to the low 80's for just a short walk. I was desperate at that point because my regular dr can't do anything as I was under the care of my pulmonologist, but my pulmonologist can't get me in until my appointment in FEBRUARY!!! 

The kicker comes when she calls my pulm., you know, the one that diagnosed my asthma? And he ""apparently"" told her I didn't have asthma, the diagnosis he fought my insurance to get me put on fasenra for, because he tested everything else AND IT WASN'T ANYTHING ELSE!!!! And said it was sarcoidosis and he had told me to go to the Cleveland clinic to see if they could help me. So now she's looking at me like I'm lying, despite it being a diagnosis FROM HIM in my chart!!! She told me to stop taking my rescue inhaler because my heart rate was fast and that I would not be getting a breathing treatment, and left. My heart rate is always fast. There is a history of that in my chart, the rescue inhaler makes it go faster for maybe 15 minutes, but it was hours after I had taken it, the side effects had worn off, and my respiration rate was in the 30's trying to compensate. But nevermore that I guess? 

Now, it's also important to note that I'm asplenic, so while being asthmatic already puts me at higher risk of pneumonia, that heightens it even further. I don't get fevers with it either. The minimum that is supposed to be done when I go to the er with shortness of breath is an x ray, but that wasn't done. The whole trip was a cluster fuck, but what happens next might just take the cake.

The nurse she was working with came in to start an iv for solu-medrol. I can't have that. One of the well known and dangerous side effects is high blood pressure. And wouldn't you know it, I get that one! And it was this very same hospital that discovered it! See, I'd been in about 6 months prior for an asthma attack and was treated with a breathing treatment and solu-medrol. It was almost comical how immediate the side effect happened. My blood pressure went from normal to 186/119. Even 2 doses of blood pressure medicine wouldn't lower it and they wanted to admit me, but my chest wasn't in a vice anymore and I just wanted to go home, but was given strict instructions to go to my regular doctor ASAP. Who sent me right back because my blood pressure went up to 210/130. And naturally when they still couldn't get it under control i was sent back home, but with the acknowledgement that I was never to be given solu-medrol. So it was a known to them issue. But it came as a surprise the poor nurse who was told to give it to me when I told him under no circumstance could I have it. And this pissed miss high and mighty right off and she made no effort to hide it before she left again. But now mr good nurse comes back in, says my kidney function is a bit off so he needs to start me on some fluids. He does that, leaves, and back comes lady high horse ""you're in acute kidney failure, schedule an appointment with your doctor about it, when the fluids are gone you can leave."" And she left again. Lovely bedside manner. No explanation, just a curt, ""your kidneys are failing"" and back out the door. 

My best friend's mom is stewing in hatred and anger, I just wanted to get the fuck out of there because it was clear I wasn't going to get any kind of help and I'd probably end up getting hurt if they did decide to ""help."" 
My regular doctor was in complete shock over the notes left about my visit, as she knows I have a diagnosis of asthma. She ordered more blood work, a urine panel (which wasn't done at the hospital and would have caught the blood in my urine) and a CT. And here's where I get part 1 that proves it's asthma, my lungs are clear! No sarcoidosis in them. Fucking. Clear. Part 2 is she caught a wheeze herself. I got fed up and bought my own stethoscope and *I* can hear the fucking wheezes too, and I'm not trained to! If my doctor could hear them,  if I can hear them, how the *hell* could that lady not? How the fuck am I supposed to get taken seriously??? I finally got prescribed a home nebulizer with duoneb medicine, but it only works for 2 hours tops before I'm struggling again, and I can only take it every 6 hours. My job requires me to be on my feet and moving around for 5 hours a night. I've done this job for 8 years, it's not something new, but all of a sudden, I'm struggling and have to sit down multiple times a night. I can't walk to work anymore, something I've done for 8 years, I can't workout anymore, something I had done with a massively enlarged spleen. Something I'd managed to do at 216 pounds, something I'd done to get down to 145. I can't do my 4 mile walks anymore, and all my hard work is gone, I gained back 20 pounds and all of my muscles have turned back to fat. I worked damn hard to get where I was, but because I can't get my lung doctor or the hospital to take me seriously anymore, I have to watch it dissappear. Do I have to die before they realize I'm not making this shit up? Because I don't want to do that. I worked hella hard to get healthy before it was ripped out of my own hands. My regular doctor is doing her best, but it feels like that hospital and that doctor are working against us. 

Tl;dr lung doctor, hospital ""doctor"" aren't taking me seriously when I tell them my breathing is getting worse and worse. I'm getting desperate and long past been scared. This is the only hospital in town too, to make it worse."
"I get pretty bad allergic asthma because I live in Houston and we get extreme pollen and mold constantly.  My allergy shots have seemed to minimize this a lot after being on them for almost two years.  I'm still on them at least another year or two I think.  

Anyway, my girlfriend recently got really into collecting and testing perfumes.  Sometimes i feel like the scents are triggering attacks but some people online say this is just imaginary and that i might be mentally reacting and somehow causing my brain to trigger an attack.

Does anyone else find that perfume triggers attacks?  It's' just weird because i'm not normally sensitive to fragrance or chemicals.  My asthma is always related to allergies and only specific things.

I have no issue with deodorant or cleaning sprays."

"Anyone else have experience with getting denied for some asthma meds despite having moderate asthma? 

I'm so tired y'all. I have pretty disruptive asthma and allergies, and I was on a regiment of allergy shots to control the allergies in addition to three daily allergy meds. However, I had to stop allergy shots because they were making my asthma worse. I also take the maximum dose of daily inhaler (Dulera), which still does not fully control my asthma.

My lovely doctor, who's been a great advocate for me, had the idea to put me on a strong, immune boosting injectable asthma medication (Dupixent). This would conceivably allow me to restart allergy shots once my asthma is under control, allowing me to take 2 different shots a week. Sucky, but worth it!

Until I found out today that I got denied for the injectable asthma medication because my asthma is not severe enough for my insurance company. Pulmonary function test showed that I a So now, I can't take injectable asthma meds (it's several thousand a week out of pocket) AND I can't take allergy shots, because my asthma is still bad enough that they can't risk making it worse by putting me through allergy shots. 

I'm waking up every morning with a painful chest and have tons of phlegm in my chest and throat. And cardio still causes me to wheeze. And yes, I've tried other inhalers, and they weren't any more effective than my current one. 

It's been a rough time and I feel like I'm at my wits end. Anyone have experience or success in a situation like this?"

"Hello, I am asking for my partner who have a severe asthma. He uses ProAir HFA (albuterol sulfate) for years and that inhaler is effective for keeping his asthma attack under control. He is a heavy user of his inhaler as he uses it 10+ times a day (20 or more a day if the environment is dusty, smokey, and/or cold). Generic inhalers are somwhat effective and could need to increase the puffs to be on the same effective level as the ProAir HFA. 

Before the pandemic, he normally gets a script for three inhalers for a month. This way, he will be able to have a backup in case if his primary inhaler ran out or cannot be found at the moment. He has one at work and two at home (one on his end table and one for immediate need use). Recently the script changed to single inhaler and only can receive one at the time. He asked his doctor about this change and the doctor told him they only can prescribe one at the time. 

This is risky for my partner because if he gets asthma attack and his inhaler ran out, he will need to go to the ER to get treated immediately. He tries to explain this to his doctor and his doctor said ‚ÄúSorry, I only can prescribe once‚Äù. It didn‚Äôt made sense why it suddenly change recently to a single inhaler whereas in the past it was fine to get 3 ProAir HFA in a single prescription. I tried to find the information on this change. 

I know California changed their regulations on Schedule I/II Drugs by allowing to use E-Script instead of going to the doctor to pick up. I wonder if their change also effects on inhalers or anyone have a clue of why the sudden change?

If anyone is curious of the location, it is in California, USA."

"Hello,

In my case I have some wheezing sound only when I inhale and only through my nose. If I inhale through my mouth..no sound. As well as if I exhale through whichever..no sound.
Just curious to hear how others have it ?

Thanks"

The Spring season is at its peak. The flowers are in full bloom, and the trees have turned lush green. All of this is welcomed. But what is not welcomed is the pollen and allergies everywhere! The Spring season is exceptionally hard on people with asthma and allergies.  


As this season arrives, people often mistake allergies for asthma. Both of these are linked in many ways, the most obvious thing in common being the feeling of misery. Let‚Äôs see below why allergies are often mistaken for asthma.   


**Allergies And Asthma**  
Asthma is a disease that affects your lungs. The main symptom of asthma is a persistent cough that mainly occurs at night or early in the morning. Other symptoms include wheezing, tightness in the chest, and shortness of breath. Asthma occurs primarily in children, but adults can get affected too. Kids developing this condition may be a likelihood of family history.  


Allergies develop when the immune system mistake substance such as pollen, mould, or dust mites as harmful and binds with the allergen. Just like asthma, allergies can affect children of all ages. The symptoms of allergies include nasal congestion, runny nose, and itchy eyes. Similar to asthma, allergies can be a likelihood of family history.  


**Allergy Treatment**  
There is no permanent solution for allergies, just like asthma, but proper medication can lessen the effects. Nasal sprays and antihistamine pills can reduce symptoms of both asthma and different allergies.   


Moreover, allergy shots (immunotherapy) can provide long-term relief from both asthma and allergies. The answer to how does it work is that these shots gradually reduce the immune-system response to allergy triggers. [**EpiPen Auto-Injector Online UK**](https://www.pharmacyplanet.com/epipen-auto-injector.html) is the best if you are looking for allergy shots.  


**Key Takeaway**  
Both allergies and asthma cause breathing difficulties, which makes people mistake these two together. Both these conditions can be triggered by the same things, such as pollen, dust, and mould. Even though most treatments are designed differently for asthma and allergies, a few treatments can still help with both conditions. [**Rhinocort Nasal Spray Online UK**](https://www.pharmacyplanet.com/rhinocort-budesonide-nasal-spray.html) can help treat the symptoms of both allergy and asthma."

"I don‚Äôt have a nothing works story but it‚Äôs pretty damn close. I can‚Äôt use dry powder inhalers because they have milk, which I‚Äôm allergic to. And I‚Äôve tried every single steroid inhaler out there other than alvesco and nothing works other than advair hfa 230-21. Advair cured my asthma practically, I don‚Äôt need any rescues anymore, regardless of anything, as long as I take advair."
My asthma flared after accidently breathing in deodorant ( I put it on me but a load of the sent of it went in my lungs) I have been having shortness of breath tonight it's been better I haven't had an asthma attack or might of has a mild one and not noticed but obviously my lungs are inflamed so how long till they go normal so I can breath better and normal again
"so i‚Äôm a pretty heavy smoker but i smoke weed and vape (occasionally a cigarette) , also have asthma. i had been fine until i started getting a lot of lung infections and they put me on the breo inhaler and prednisone for 5 days the last time i went to the urgent care. i‚Äôve had a cough for months now but the doctors never seem to be too concerned. i‚Äôve noticed that my left lung vibrates and my roommate put her hand on my back and could easily feel it. am i just getting sick from a weak immune system and asthma or should i go see an actual lung doctor? i‚Äôm only 18 so copd isn‚Äôt a concern for me but i‚Äôm starting to worry lol"
"I‚Äôm 32 and a life long asthma sufferer (diagnosed before I was 4). Medication I‚Äôm on daily is 1 pill singular daily and 4 doses (puffs) of my Symbicort when I‚Äôm feeling fine. Also Ventolin (blue puffer) as a rescue which is seldom used when I‚Äôm doing well. My asthma gets extremely aggravated when I get a cold usually. Even if the cold symptoms only stick around for 2 to 3 days my asthma symptoms will stick around for 2 to 3 weeks. When I feel a cold coming on or the beginning of asthma symptoms being flared up I‚Äôve been instructed by my doctor to increase my Symbicort to 8 puffs a day the more spread out the more effective. 

With Covid, masks, and sanitizer Myself and my family had been very healthy for the last two years as far as the common cold goes. But right after Halloween my two oldest daughters caught a cold which I inevitably caught about a week later. The cold itself was quite mild symptoms lasted about five days just sore throat runny nose basically. My asthma symptoms on the other hand have been quite flared up even using the max dosage of Symbicort daily for the past 6 weeks along with multiple uses of the blue puffer rescue inhaler. It seems to have fluctuated as far as severity in this past six weeks but never goes away as soon as I think I‚Äôm getting better and try to drop down the Symbicort dose it gets worse again. 

Has anyone had any similar experience with this if so was there anything that you could do to improve!

Thanks"
"Hi,
How can we differentiate between Asthma and bronchitis?

Doctors here in our country are so busy with patients they hardly diagnose the condition properly and simply do trial on patients. It works fine else they recommend something else, without even listening to the symptoms fully they fill up the sheet with lab tests."

"I started getting symptoms about 7 years ago. But went to doctor first time about 6 years ago.

Back then they thought it was ""an asthmatic-kind-of reaction to having a cold"" so they sent me on my way with a rescue inhaler.

4 years ago I had my first lungfunction test. My doctor told me that while she recognised my symptoms as being asthmatic, I was very close but not diagnosed with asthma and again sent home with only a rescue inhaler.

Two years ago I moved, switched doctors, had to use my rescue inhaler more than the maximum amount per day. So I went to my new doctor, who was shocked I was still functioning. But since coronavirus was already everywhere, no tests were done and I got sent home with actual medication. Wasnt perfect, but had to use my rescue inhaler significantly less.

Cue to last september, things were getting better in healthcare in my area so finally got tested! Told the lady who was testing me ""I'm always worried when I go to the doctors, nothing seems to be wrong."" ""Well,"" she said ""something is definetely up, don't you worry ;)"". Anyway, got diagnosed with asthma and now on symbicort. 

We tested a little bit with the dosage, but now I can go weeks without my rescue inhaler! And now that my lungs arent holding me back anymore, my whole body is screaming ""you didn't do shit for the last 6 years and we don't want to start working now!"" Which is frustrating but something I have to work on I guess.

Do you guys have any tips for a recent diagnosed asthma patient? I feel like I'm struggling more in the cold air. Any tips are very much appreciated! Also glad to have found such a nice community üòä"
"I'm curious what other asthmatics do or would do in this situation. 

I've been diagnosed since I was 4 years old and am now 35. I know my asthma pretty well at this point and my triggers. Every time I go to my in laws' house, I invariably need to use my inhaler. Something in their house aggravates my allergies, and thus my asthma. I suspect dust and mold since they are borderline hoarders and can't/don't clean well because of all the stuff.

I am currently in the middle of an exacerbation, wound up on prednisone and the doctor increased advair dosage. With Christmas next week, I offered to host my in laws at my house. They have flat refused, citing the importance of  ""memories."" I'm now trying to decide what I should do. My options right now, it seems, are go and probably have an asthma attack or stay home and send my partner and kids without me. Neither of these are my preference, so I'm wondering now if I'm an asshole, making a big deal out of nothing. But breathing is kind of important to me, soo... tell me, if you are inclined, what would you do?"
Does anyone else feel like almost every new food they try exasperates their asthma?
So apparently my hormones may be making me havjng breathing issues more so during my time of the month. I have allergy type symptoms all year around. I do have gerd as well so that doesn't help. I seen a pulmonologist for the first time ever today and he put me on singulair only to be taken during my period and if needed a rescue inhaler. stopping my advair which was irritating my gerd anyways. has anyone ever been on singulair as a on and off certain time medication? I can usually handle my allergy symptoms with simple allergy meds but when I'm in my cycle everything is a bit much
"Hi everyone,

I'm putting up this post to gather some information from fellow asthmatics. I'm 26, 75 kg, and a long-time asthmatic... for many years (around ages 15 - 21) I was very inactive, smoked a lot, and did very little (or no) exercise. In recent years I've been trying to get fit and improve my overall health. I have a deviated septum which leads to a lot of mouth breathing and I take 1 puff of Symbicort (lowest dose possible) before I go to bed at night.

I started running in the gym and can now run for around 30 minutes if I take a single puff (power inhaler, terbutaline) before exercise. HOWEVER, if I don't take my inhaler before running, even for five minutes, I feel quite breathless and winded, my head feels quite 'poundy' and I feel quite weak. Is this typical for somebody who is asthmatic? I'm concerned I have some sort of heart problem, although I don't have chest pain or anything along those lines.

Many thanks everyone."
"Hi everyone just wondering how long different people use Symbicort or similar inhalers for mild or severe asthma?

"Have you guys ever noticed massive fatigue and weakness from your inhalers? I got put on Spiriva a month ago, and since then have been getting more and more fatigued with muscle weakness.

I‚Äôm currently on Fostair 100/6 (which my body tolerates well) and Spiriva."

"Hi first post here. I'm 18 I have asthma, vocal cord dysfunction, gerd and allergies (dog, cat, ragweed) which all interact and trigger each other. I have 2 dogs and very very many cats ( been trying to find them new homes).

 Anyway almost every single time I shower I have an asthma attack shortly after or even during the shower. I can only shower about once a week due to my other disabilities but it's still extremely detrimental. This used to not be a trigger for me, even  6 months ago and hot showers were actually very helpful when I was younger. I try not to exert myself as much as possible while showering and I use a shower chair. I always shower with the vent on and the door open. I can't seem to figure out why showering specifically has become such an issue. Cold showers are not an option because it's a major spasticity trigger. I'm using my inhaler basically weekly at this point after showering and it's exhausting. Any advice???"
"I bought my first ever real Christmas tree this year because I'm hosting Christmas dinner. Haven't really bothered in the past. It is a standard pine tree, very pretty. But my god has it fucked with my breathing. I'd largely had the asthma under control and now it's back with a vengeance.

Keen to hear from you if you use a fresh tree (potted or cut). Is there a species that is less triggering? The internet has suggested Blue Spruce, Norway Spruce, Norfolk Island Pine. What's your low allergy go to?

Maybe this is a southern hemisphere thing as Christmas coincides with some tree pollen seasons. 

Respect those who choose plastic trees but I'm trying to reduce the amount of unnecessary plastics in our household."
"Hey all.

Great to find this sub and I hope everyone is doing well. 

So, for years I've felt that when I drink Diluted Juice or 'Squash' it makes my asthma flare up. Luckily it's just a very mild flare but I always get caught off guard by the tasty drink.

Any ideas why this would be? Is it something in the drink? Anyone else?"
"I know I should probably go to a doctor but just want some ideas from some of you guys.

I have had a slight wheeze when breathing out slowly all my life and have never gone to the doctors about it. 

I‚Äôm just wondering what sort of symptoms you guys get. Should I try an inhaler?

I only really have the wheeze, if I exercise in the cold it does really end up hurting my throat.

I‚Äôve honestly got no idea so any help would be appreciated. I‚Äôm 20M if that‚Äôs useful."
"Anyone experience the same? My chest gets tight after I eat, especially if I don‚Äôt take my time. Ugh."
"Hey guys, I made the stupid mistake of dropping my space halfway through using flovent. I feel I didn't get the full puff so I did another one. Now I'm scared it's going to mess something up :/

I only need one puff twice a day of 110mcg. Will this 3rd use screw me up somehow or am I good as long as I don't do it again? My asthma's controlled really well with the flovent otherwise."

"I just can‚Äôt do it. I get shortness of breath for weeks after just an hour with a mask on to visit my dr. My inhaler does barely anything to help. 
I breath easier in a smokey bar than I do with a mask on. 

Even my dr told me to try not to wear a mask when I could. They get covids a risk but if my asthma gets worse from it what am I supposed to do? Half the city I‚Äôm in doesn‚Äôt care anymore, the other half has every vaccinated person still wearing a mask and distancing 6ft. 

Idk wtf to believe or do anymore, but all I know is I can‚Äôt breath and it fucking sucks. My asthma has never been this bad and I don‚Äôt want to make it any worse. üòû"
I went to urgent care last Monday and got diagnosed for these things.  Despite meds I am still dragging and not sleeping through the night.  So I am taking the day off work and seeing a doctor this afternoon.  Please keep me in your thoughts and send emotional support.  Thanks.
I'm just full of so many questions!
Kind of freaking out. New to asthma and this inhaler (my other one I don‚Äôt need to shake)

I saw people post online 13 years ago about toxic laundry detergent, softeners, and dryer sheets.¬† After 13 years, we're still talking about it,¬†no laws ban it.¬† Our voices are too weak to be heard, or they do hear but they don't care.¬†¬†I¬†contacted¬†the American¬†Lung¬†Association; they replied to me that¬†they can't stop people from using scented laundry products.¬†¬†With such an¬†attitude, how they can protect people's lung health.¬†  


In fact, the artificial fragrances¬†in many of laundry products do not provide any cleaning benefit but do contribute to¬†asthma,¬†cancers,¬†migraine headaches, dizziness,¬†rashes, multiple chemical sensitivities, sinus allergies, and other respiratory illnesses.  


A study from Washington¬†State University¬†([https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723134438.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723134438.htm))¬†reveals that scented laundry detergents and dryer sheets are laced with two carcinogens such as benzene which¬†has¬†a¬†somewhat¬†sweet smell and acetaldehyde¬†both of¬†which the EPA says should not be inhaled¬†and¬†can raise your cancer risks.¬† Through the dryer vents, at high temperatures, the toxic chemicals are emitted¬†into the outside air, becoming even more lethal, even¬†if¬†we close¬†our windows,¬†the smells are still coming in and lingering in the air.¬†¬†  
We can pick up different¬†food,¬†but we have no choice but to share the same air, even it's lethal pollution.¬†People¬†have been inhaling¬†toxic chemicals for much of their lives.¬†¬†We are literally being poisoned and killed softly, slowly by these emitted chemical products.  
   
Workers in¬†factories¬†with¬†pollution have very¬†high cancer¬†rates.¬†Workers at¬†power plants,¬†chemical plants,¬†and¬†paper manufacturing plants commonly have liver cancer, blood cancer, lung cancer,¬†and¬†pancreatic cancer,¬†as well as other health issues.¬†¬†I believe¬†that¬†cancer rates in the laundry detergent¬†factories¬†must be very high too.  
Some people might think it's nothing, but they should understand that it really is a big deal.  
Please think about¬†all the¬†people getting sick¬†unnecessarily.¬†¬†Cancers, asthma, lung fibrosis,¬†and other¬†health issues could be prevented.¬†¬†Prevention is the important thing. Instead of¬†dealing with¬†these diseases,¬†often¬†not even knowing how we got them,¬†we should take¬†precautions as a society and rid¬†our neighborhoods and our world of these dangerous and unnecessary¬†chemicals.¬†  
   
Here is a link to¬†Dr. Anne Steinemann's website on this subject.¬†¬†[https://www.drsteinemann.com/home2.html](https://www.drsteinemann.com/home2.html)  Dr. Steinmann is Professor of Engineering at James Cook University, Australia, and Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Melbourne, Australia.¬† Hopefully, after you've¬†read what she writes,¬†you'll change your mind and fight back together.  
A bill should be sponsored that would restrict the use of scents in consumer¬†products (especially where they serve no purpose except cause health risks).¬†¬†

"What do you take when you have bronchitis (or other acute respiratory illnesses)? I‚Äôve been taking my ventolin, but it‚Äôs not helping (I do have asthma)."
"Hey guys , I have had asthma for the past 15 years since I was 9 ish and been doing reasonably well building up the strength in my lungs through exercise this past year. 

I recently caught what I believe to be the flu, my flu symptoms have been gone for around 2 weeks now and my chest did seem to clear up quite well however I have found that since this I'm out of breath all the time now and symptoms are flaring up pretty much daily but when I use my oximeter it reads between 97-99 with a normal bpm and my peak flow is sitting between 400-430 ; ( I believe my personal best was around 480) so it is a bit lower but I'm relatively sure that's still classed as being in the ""green zone"" and not needing to see a doctor. Do you think this will clear up on it's own and I needn't be worried or should I speak to a Doctor ?"
When I was 4 I had pneumonia then it went to asthma iv just found that asthma caused by pneumonia is severe In the 4 stages. Will my asthma always be severe and will it ever go away sometimes my asthma gets bad sometimes it is mild and sometimes I go months without it
"three days ago I had a severe attack, which thankfully my inhaler helped with (after four puffs or so). probably the worst attack I've had so far. By the time the paramedics arrived, my readings were normal but I was still having some trouble, and felt like I was going to pass out. They took me to the ER to monitor me, and I ended up going home a couple of hours later because I felt better. Have been in bed for three days. I did have a very mild attack the same day, but it didn't last very long and only required one puff. my lungs and chest started feeling strange the next day, as if they were weakened and irritated. This lasted for an entire day. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on recovering from a severe attack. Also, has anyone else experienced a strange sensation in the lungs and chest after an attack?"
"I know this a stupid question. But I usually think of wheezing as this loud dramatic sound. So I say no, everytime a medical person has asked me do I wheeze.

But I do have whistling from my throat occasionally. And couching. Is whistling wheezing just at a different pitch?"

My mom‚Äôs birthday is today.  I am staying home to rest.   I have been on antibiotics for 5 days.

Our workplace has us work one week in the office, 3 weeks from home.  Last week I worked from home as it was my week but tomorrow starts my week to go in.

I am going to ask if I can WFH while I am still coughing as our office is nervous (understandably) about sick people being there.  My doctor does want me to get more rest so I may call in sick tomorrow.

It is hard to be sick around the holidays.  I am glad to have the WFH option and I hope the boss will let me do it this week until my cough is better.

Thanks for listening; support appreciated.  Thanks"

"My doctor told me every 4 hours. That's what I did to start with byt yesterday and today I solved it out using it 12 hours apart during the day and 4 hours apart at night. 

He didn't really give me good instructions. Does this seem like a good schedule? My peak flow is improving"
"It became really obvious this winter that dry air is a major trigger for coughing and post nasal drip. Sometimes together, sometimes just the coughing. If the humidity drops in the house my lungs feel like they were run through an air fryer.   


The only time I get any real relief is in the shower with the exhaust fan off. I can run multiple humidifiers in the house and a pot of water on the stove until I have steam on the windows. It helps but I am still dealing with bits of post nasal drip and coughing. Saline spray doesn't seem to significantly help besides using it to clear out mucous.   


Anyone found a good tactic that helps besides what I have already been doing?"
"I'm going through an exacerbation for the last few days, I have already seen my pulmonologist who prescribed me levalbulterol nebs every 6 hours plus my usual meds. I have prednisone in case of an emergency. I'm going to have my covid booster tomorrow so I'm holding off on the steroids - my pulmonologist is aware. Anywho, I had a GREAT day yesterday where I went to the store, built furniture, cooked, cleaned, just everything I wanted to do. I was coughing but nothing terrible. Today I wake up and my peak flow was normal, but I had chest tightness so I nebulized and that made it worse. I was able to get out of it and I feel much better now. My question is, has anyone had very good days while having an exacerbation and then back to feeling shortness of breath and coughing? I also added mucinex which seems to help a lot. I'm afraid of using my nebulizer again."

"This is one of my first posts in this page, I have some extra time this evening and I would like to pass down some information that has changed my life with Asthma.

Background - diagnosed with allergy and cold induced asthma at the age of 4 and then exercise induced at 12, been through all types of medications since then like Albuterol, xopenex. You name it i've used it. In and out of the hospital at least every other year as all the way up until 16. 

When I turned 16 I made the decision to try and get into the Marine Corps. I was set on it and willing to try anything. So I did. I started with running and afterwords I refrained from using an inhaler and instead practiced Pursed Lip Breathing. I believe that running helped strengthen my diaphragm so I could breathe through the symptoms. It worked. Next I practiced using a free diving app which taught me how to hold my breath and practiced square breathing techniques. This got me comfortable with having a lack of oxygen and trained me mentally when it came to situations where I was feeling clogged up or couldn't breathe too well.
Then I started swimming and practicing breathe holding, crossovers and combat breast stroke. I believe that breathing against the pressure of the water further strengthened my diaphragm. Lastly I started wearing an altitude mask whenever I could to train my mind and body for lack of oxygen and to strengthen my diaphragm. 

All of this training I did started off very easy and over the months got progressively more difficult so I never reached a point where I was comfortable with the training for more than a couple sessions. I felt more confident that if my symptoms came up that I could stay calm, relax and breathe through it. Panicking as we all know makes it worse.

Some things I still have to avoid are allergies, and getting sick. You can't train allergies away even with allergy shots which I also got for 4 years. 
I NOW HAVE A CONTROLLER THAT I CAN TAKE WHEN THINGS GET OUT OF HAND. I want to stress the importance of having your medication even if you think you are fine. As most of us know it can come up out of nowhere and hit you like never before.

All of this being said I made it through boot camp and got sick with a cough and got the proper medications from the doctors while there. Not once did I admit i've been diagnosed with asthma before joining, as some of you know that will disqualify you.

I wrote this for those who may need some guidance on how you might be able to overcome some of the aspects of asthma and I hope that these things work for you too, follow your dreams and overcome as much as you can while being safe about it!"
"Hello and thank you for doing this.
I was on spiriva and fostair and I was changed to Trelegy. I‚Äôm not sure what I think so far I think it‚Äôs given me a chest infection. How long should I leave it before I tell the doctor? I‚Äôve been on it 3 weeks today. Thank you"
I was just prescribed Albuterol. I have the inhaler but am very nervous about using it. I'm mostly worried about the side effect of it closing my airways or making my heart do strange things. How common is this? I have an anxiety disorder so I overthink things like this very frequently
"Today is realised that for the past year my asthma was only bad twice qnd I'm just hyperventilating all the time.

In December last year I had an asthma attack that got worse over 5 days to the point where I couldn't breath. Now around 4 months later I was deep breathing constantly cause I was scared to have this attack again. I took my inhalers right and blue inhalers most of the time but they never worked.

But it seems I have shortness of breath every few hrs a day and sometimes chest pain but no mucus coughing or wheezing iv not had that since last year. I always blamed my asthma till I thought I was hyperventilating which I'm 99 percent sure that is what's happening

Is this common with asthma just to worry about my breathing all the time that it makes me feel like I'm short of breath all the time"

"Hello r/Asthma, I'm a respiratory therapist.

Feel free to ask me anything you'd like.

I mainly run, manage and optimize ventilators in the hospital. However, as a profession like mine deals with your disease process fairly often, I figured I'd see if I can clear up some discrepancies in your information base and help you take better care of yourself. 

Asthma affects people of all ages, lifestyles and ethnic backgrounds, and there are several subtypes within the umbrella of Asthma. Don't be ashamed, let's talk. As a patient advocate in the clinical arena, my boxing gloves are up to get you the best resources that I can.

A better plan and knowing what to do (in your power) are key to a successful and comfortable lifestyle with what can often be a difficult and debilitating condition if not properly managed. I find that a lot of my patients know what an inhaler is and roughly how to use it, but miss key details like when to use it and how often they should be using it to keep it working right.

Let me know how I can help. I want to keep y'all out of the hospital for exacerbations as often as possible because the more exacerbations you have, the less effective the medications we use to treat you will be."
"Im so nervous . my last pfizer shot i woke up and not even within 15 minutes i had an asthma flare up , my inhalers worked and i was okay but i had chest pain that lasted days and a lingering cough . Eventually i got scared and booked with an emergency clinic and was put on flovant 250 FHA ( works amazing havent had a flare up since ) but i did notice ‚Ä¶ my symptoms in general did worsen a bit , nothing serious but there was a bit of a decline , so now if i dont take my preventer my asthma acts up , before i could easily get away with it . so im a lil nervous for the booster shot however i do hope to remain positive , as a child i had real bad asthma so if there is more of a decline i am going to tell myself ‚Äú this has happened before and i am okay ‚Äú its just i am living on my own now so its a bit more scarier .  so please let me know how your experiences went , i am getting the shot regardless , my dad is immune compromised and my dads over protective of my health lol"
Anybody use Breo? My doc just gave me it but I don‚Äôt want it to give me bad side effects. Does it make you go red or dry skin or give you acne? I have taken symbicort in the past so is it harsher than that?
"So, basically, I haven't had a mild asthma attack for around 6 years now and strong ""I feel like I'm gonna die"" asthma attacks haven't struck me for almost a decade now (When I was around 12~).

What I would usually do during my teenage years is when as asthma attack strikes, I usually just ignore it and it'd go away after a day or two. Only thing an attack prevents me from doing is running and doing any strenuous activities.

Now, I always have a nebulizer ready just in case it does get worse or if I just want to quickly get rid of it immediately (i.e. If I REALLY want to go biking today but a mild attack is preventing me from doing so).

But anyways, will there be any long-term effects from ignoring an asthma attack? Or is it totally safe to just ignore it whenever possible?"

I saw people post online 13 years ago about toxic laundry detergent, softeners, and dryer sheets.¬† After 13 years, we're still talking about it,¬†no laws ban it.¬† Our voices are too weak to be heard, or they do hear but they don't care.¬†¬†I¬†contacted¬†the American¬†Lung¬†Association; they replied to me that¬†they can't stop people from using scented laundry products.¬†¬†With such an¬†attitude, how they can protect people's lung health.¬†  


In fact, the artificial fragrances¬†in many of laundry products do not provide any cleaning benefit but do contribute to¬†asthma,¬†cancers,¬†migraine headaches, dizziness,¬†rashes, multiple chemical sensitivities, sinus allergies, and other respiratory illnesses.  


A study from Washington¬†State University¬†([https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723134438.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723134438.htm))¬†reveals that scented laundry detergents and dryer sheets are laced with two carcinogens such as benzene which¬†has¬†a¬†somewhat¬†sweet smell and acetaldehyde¬†both of¬†which the EPA says should not be inhaled¬†and¬†can raise your cancer risks.¬† Through the dryer vents, at high temperatures, the toxic chemicals are emitted¬†into the outside air, becoming even more lethal, even¬†if¬†we close¬†our windows,¬†the smells are still coming in and lingering in the air.¬†¬†  
We can pick up different¬†food,¬†but we have no choice but to share the same air, even it's lethal pollution.¬†People¬†have been inhaling¬†toxic chemicals for much of their lives.¬†¬†We are literally being poisoned and killed softly, slowly by these emitted chemical products.  
   
Workers in¬†factories¬†with¬†pollution have very¬†high cancer¬†rates.¬†Workers at¬†power plants,¬†chemical plants,¬†and¬†paper manufacturing plants commonly have liver cancer, blood cancer, lung cancer,¬†and¬†pancreatic cancer,¬†as well as other health issues.¬†¬†I believe¬†that¬†cancer rates in the laundry detergent¬†factories¬†must be very high too.  
Some people might think it's nothing, but they should understand that it really is a big deal.  
Please think about¬†all the¬†people getting sick¬†unnecessarily.¬†¬†Cancers, asthma, lung fibrosis,¬†and other¬†health issues could be prevented.¬†¬†Prevention is the important thing. Instead of¬†dealing with¬†these diseases,¬†often¬†not even knowing how we got them,¬†we should take¬†precautions as a society and rid¬†our neighborhoods and our world of these dangerous and unnecessary¬†chemicals.¬†  
   
Here is a link to¬†Dr. Anne Steinemann's website on this subject.¬†¬†[https://www.drsteinemann.com/home2.html](https://www.drsteinemann.com/home2.html)  Dr. Steinmann is Professor of Engineering at James Cook University, Australia, and Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Melbourne, Australia.¬† Hopefully, after you've¬†read what she writes,¬†you'll change your mind and fight back together.  
A bill should be sponsored that would restrict the use of scents in consumer¬†products (especially where they serve no purpose except cause health risks).¬†¬†  
In order to protect our environment and our health as well as our children's,¬†here¬†are two petition links. I¬†hope you can support signing so I don't feel I'm alone.

"Her asthma changs when theres a sudden change in weather (like from cold to warm)

is there anything we can give her to help with her breathing control?"


"I have had asthma since I was 4 I got it after I had pneumonia 
Iv been noticing recently at this time of night my asthma or breathing gets bad deep breaths and that's it but in the day I'm ok with a few breathing difficulties that I think are related to my anxiety not asthma.

Is there something triggering asthma at night I'm not wheezy only if I breath out with force but peak flow is around 600 highest is 650."

I accidentally left my Ventolin inhaler in my pocket and it went through the washer and dryer is it okay to continue using?

I‚Äôm worried to sleep with asthma since I‚Äôm new to it always worried I‚Äôll stop breathing
"Starts as a small cold that goes through my family, go on prednisone for post-nasal drip cough for 5 days, at end of 5 days coughing even more so go back to find I now have a sinus infection, get put on antibiotic, at end of antibiotic feel even worse, go back to doctor, find I now have walking pneumonia and the sinus infection somehow got worse, get put on different stronger antibiotic and prednisone taper. Then, when I'm finally done with all my prescriptions and back in school, get undescribably painful oral thrush from all those inhalers. I've been sick for a month, fuck my life."
"This past weekend I helped my dad chase some horses, which really only required some light jogging, but afterwards I was struggling to breathe. I could barely speak a few words without having to inhale, my throat felt tight, it was hard to swallow and my chest felt heavy whenever I breathed. It was like that for almost 8 hours before I went to the ER, where the doctor said I was having an asthma attack. 
I specifically asked if it could be because I was just out of shape, but he very firmly stated that it was abnormal and should it happen again I was supposed to come right back to the ER. He thought it was exercise-induced asthma.
He prescribed an inhaler and told me to go get a doctor's appointment, which I had today.

The doctor I met only just listened to my lungs and said nothing was wrong with me, when really I was supposed to be there for getting some breathing test that never happened. Obviously I wasn't struggling to breathe after just waking up.
He said it was probably just the cold that caused it.

Does that make sense? Is it normal to struggle to breathe after barely jogging after some horses in the snow? I have struggled to breathe before in similar situations, maybe not as cold, but it usually calms down after a few hours."

"I haven't used an inhaler in years. I'm 17 currently.  Some days I can run and feel like I can run a marathon with infinite breathe. Then the next day I feel like I can't breathe. (lungs closing up and that kind of feeling). So do I need to go get one again?   


And when when I can't breathe, running while breathing lightweight hurts."
"I searched the sub and didn‚Äôt see anything too recent about this. 

I just ordered a propeller tracker for my rescue inhaler (Ventolin HFA) for free from them after seeing an advertisement from AstraZeneca that they were doing the promotion. The only for my maintenance inhaler (Advair HFA) would be $80 if I ordered it &amp; it‚Äôs only available through Walgreens. 

The app seems great for tracking attacks and rescue inhaler use to help identify triggers, keep it logged for discussing it with your doctor, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has used the device/app (specifically for maintenance inhaler use) and if it‚Äôs worth the price tag? 

It looks like they have lots of models for all kinds of inhalers now, even though I think this promotion is only for some inhalers, I‚Äôm hoping if it‚Äôs more widely used now there might be some more opinions out there"
"i know this isn‚Äôt the place for a diagnosis or whatever, i would just like some advice from likeminded people. basically, i contracted what i assume to be bronchitis during late august/early september, and then coronavirus in late september/early october. during my bout of bronchitis, i noticed my flat had grew mould in various places and honestly i thought nothing of it so i just cleaned it. it‚Äôs probably worth mentioning, i‚Äôm a regular smoker (i do have asthmatic siblings, but i haven‚Äôt had issues myself before this year) and most of my coughs i chalk down to smokers cough however, not one of my coughs have lasted as long as the one i currently have. for weeks now i‚Äôve experienced coughing fits that i can‚Äôt control which are followed by me coughing up mucus and/or wheezing depending on what started it. the mould has also come back, and i assume this is a bad reaction to it (allergies maybe) but factors such as laughing or smoking or exercise can set me off. my doctor is convinced i have a chest infection despite me explaining that the mucus i cough up is clear, i have no pain and otherwise feel well besides feeling exhausted after a coughing fit. i can‚Äôt explain how they make me feel other than that feeling you get when you get into an ice cold bath and you gasp for a breath, except it lasts for minutes instead.

so, am i right in being stubborn with my gp in requesting asthma tests? he‚Äôs ordered me a chest x ray but won‚Äôt see me for asthma for another month should i still have symptoms by then. he reckons adult onset asthma from mould is unlikely and honestly i feel like i‚Äôm being dramatic or making it up so i guess i just need some opinions because i don‚Äôt know what to think, like, i‚Äôm 22 and i‚Äôve never had these sorts of problems before."
"When I was 2 and 3 years old I had asthma. If my parents hadn‚Äôt told me i would have probably never known. I know it for about 2 days now and I‚Äôm very surprised, i never knew that I have a chronic disease. Since being 3 years old there‚Äôs never been a day where I had symptoms. I was treated back then with inhalers a young child. But now for above 17 years I am symptom free. How is this even possible?"
"Next semester, I'm gonna be going to in-person college and my college is in a shitty downtown area filled with lots of smokers in every way you go. 2.5 years in the college left (all these years are in person). The air is probably gonna be filled with a bunch of tobacco everywhere, and its unfortunate my college is in such a shite area, but will this lead to me developing COPD? The last thing I want is more lung issues. I could take pretty much anything but the one thing I cannot handle is more lung issues. I really hope not. I will try to stay away from smoking people as much as possible, but for those who haven't been to  downtown area, I must say... pretty much everyone there left and right does drugs :( . I'm thankful smoke doesn't give me asthma attacks, I'm just kind of concerned on the COPD element of things."
"Hello All

"I'm getting over an exacerbation, finally today was feeling slightly better. Went to the supermarket, double masked, and I swear to God every step I took felt like my heart was going to explode. I've been walking around the house and up and down stairs, and going for short walks while having this exacerbation so I don't understand why it felt like I was going to have a heart attack (I had my heart checked this year, stress test, echo, Holter, everything was fine). Does this happen to anyone else?"
"Hi, first of all, I have no idea if I have an asthma, but I was scrolling through some allergies posts and was redirected to this one. 



I‚Äôve had allergies for my whole life, they wouldn‚Äôt give me any reactions to a really easy ones. But few years ago I‚Äôd start coughing badly and feeling like I‚Äôm out of breath, it would last only few seconds and then everything was back to normal. 



Since the covid started, I‚Äôve had these moments of breathlessness again, my doctor suspects I had a covid and it‚Äôs a result of it (I was sick for almost two months and had an inflammation in my lungs). 



And now occasions Id start coughing, but it lasts longer and I‚Äôm feeling like i‚Äôm out of breath and it makes me panic. I went to the ENT and he said it‚Äôs just allergies but didn‚Äôt prescribe me anything at all. I have mo idea what are the triggers(I do have a really fluffy cat and cat allergies but I got some medicine and it helps but I still caught a lot). 




Some of my other symptoms are runny nose when i‚Äôm not sick, weird feeling my throat like there‚Äôs something in there and i have to cough and occasionally my lymph nodes get swollen."

"I went to the urgent care center Monday with wheezing and a cough.  I was diagnosed with an asthma flare up and bronchitis and prescribed nebulizer treatment, an antibiotic, oral steroid, and cough medicine.  I am starting to feel better gradually.  A Covid test was negative.

I am working from home but need to go into the office next week.  I will call in if I am too sick.

I hope to get well soon.  I was hoping to join my family for my mom‚Äôs birthday Sunday and to see people in the office.

I am 54F, diagnosed with asthma at 23, history of acute bronchitis.

I wondered if anyone else was getting sick.  I have been working from home for the past 3 weeks and have not seen many people.

Thanks for listening."
My almost 3 year old was diagnosed with asthma recently. I‚Äôve heard both stories about asthma getting better with age and it getting worse. What was it like for you? Is your doctor able to say if you‚Äôll outgrow it or not? Thanks !
"I feel like I am doomed and the situation is hopeless. I have allergic asthma to both cigarette and fireplace smoke. My asthma is not well controlled because I am only using moneleukast and my inhaler (Atrovent). I was using inhaled steroids but it keeps giving me constant fungal infections (no matter what I do). And my primary has checked, there is no reason for a compromised immune system. I have swished, brushed teeth, probiotics, yogurt, etc. 

But I can‚Äôt seem to escape smoke! When I live in non-smoking apartments, people still smoke outside and it wafts in through the vents. Or they smoke inside against the rules. 

So I rented a house, but multiple neighbors use wood stoves for heat where I live. I‚Äôve caulked the windows and we have two true hepa air purification filters that should easily clean the square footage. 

But still I am reacting to the neighbors smoke. It is obvious because it gets worse when they get home from work every day and the fires start going. I start to have trouble (mainly pressure in my sternum, not wheezing as much) about 30 seconds before the red light on the air filters come on! So I am somehow more sensitive than they are! I don‚Äôt know if this is common. I have been wearing an n95 around the house on the worst nights. 

Is there anything I can do now? This is how people heat their homes, and they don‚Äôt have other options, so they can‚Äôt stop. 

And what about in the future? How can I buy a house? We‚Äôve been looking to try to buy a place far away from other homes but that is challenging due to cost. It is also hard because we need to remain in a colder climate and near-ish to a major hospital but other than that, I don‚Äôt really care. 

And while I usually react right away, what if there is lingering third hand smoke in the house that I buy that I don‚Äôt realize immediately? Does anyone have experience or tips for this? 

But honestly, I just don‚Äôt know what to do. The fungal infections are horrible. But so is having daily bad asthma attacks."
Peak flow at 550 the night before 430 tonight. Feeling blocked up in nose. Think this is gonna be a hard winter
I‚Äôm a 14 M and i recently got a dog. I‚Äôm allergic to dogs but we had gotten a hypo allergenic dog hoping it would be better for me. Over the past week it‚Äôs started getting worse where i‚Äôve been using my inhaler very frequently inside the house with my dog. I‚Äôm fine outside of home but it‚Äôs getting to a point where my chest is hurting and i‚Äôm coughing nonstop. I don‚Äôt want to get rid of my dog as it would make me feel bad but i don‚Äôt wanna keep her till the point it gets worse and worse. What can I do?
Any?
"Hi, 

I‚Äôm afraid of dying. I‚Äôm in so much pain and wondering if I can ever breathe normally again. My family member got a dog knowing I would have severe asthma attacks. She won‚Äôt keep the dog somewhere else. Ever since that day, I use my inhaler every hour. My body hurts and feels very sick. My energy levels are always low. I‚Äôm too poor to move out and not in a state to work. I have an air filter in my room, and the dog is never allowed in my room. I wish people will consider not harming other people, especially when it is family. I feel that I can die if I go much longer like this. 

Many workplaces in my city allow dogs. I‚Äôm losing hope. I feel hopeless as I don‚Äôt have opportunity, my health, or hope. Anyone have any ideas or suggestions on what I can do?"
"Hi all - had a pretty frightening attack happen yesterday. I had been feeling a mild chest tightness / need to cough for about a week, but symptoms subsided with my inhaler. Yesterday, I was at work, sitting outside (foggy and humid weather, which changed suddenly from the dry and cold weather we have been having, but i am used to it here in Florida) when I felt this same feeling come on. I coughed for about 2 minutes, then excused myself to my desk to get out of the humidity. I took another puff and felt relief for about 5 seconds, then the tightness / cough / wheezing returned. A medical professional who works in our building came and took my O2 levels, which came back at 73%. My superior immediately called an ambulance, who immediately gave me a nebulizer treatment, and I was in and out of consciousness until I was in the hospital. Once there and received a second treatment, I started to feel quite a bit better. They said that my O2 and CO2 levels were extremely low in the ambulance and they believed i was beginning to experience respiratory failure. Once becoming resolved (and conscious,) i started to panic about the situation, hyperventilating, which made me feel even worse. Does anyone have any tips to not panic in this situation? I have never had an attack that was so bad it sent me to the ER, and the doctor there told me it was very fair to panic, but I would hate to find myself in this situation again at all. Any advice helps!"
"Today I came to my friend's house for the night.
After years of packing my inhaler wherever I went, I made a mistake. I took a different bag than my normal one this time and forgot to place the inhaler. 

The dust triggered my asthma and now I realise where my inhaler is. Can't afford to buy a new one suddenly. Will have to spend the night taking manual breaths before I can goo back home in the morning and take a puff. Oh god."
"Has anyone experienced stomach issues after taking Symbicort turbuhaler, I was under the impressing it only went into your lungs , it‚Äôs the first dry powder inhaler I‚Äôve tried and my toilet situation got so bad I‚Äôve had to stop taking it , are normal inhalers different to dry powder ones in that aspect"

"Has anyone heard/experienced this?
I‚Äôve had Asthma for 30 years- it was well controlled for most of that and got even better after I switched from Advair to Breo.
About 3 weeks post-delivery my asthma flared and hasn‚Äôt been the same since(3 years later).

I have an appointment with a Pulmonologist in a month as my GP can no longer help me, but in the meantime I use my nebulizer daily and wake up in the morning unable to take full breaths/ walking around stores gets me winded now.

My GP said asthma changes were normal post- delivery but resolve within a few months."
"My asthma is controlled with a maintenance inhaler and rescue for exercise 

I got sick a week ago with flu/cold symptoms. 4 days ago it got worse. I started having to use my rescue at night, wake up to take a steam shower, and use a humidifier. 

I went to the doctor 3 days ago and he gave me steroids and benzonatate. 

I woke up to a coughing fit tonight and couldn't stop. My rescue didn't work. The shower didn't work. I was seen at the ER where my pulse ox was consistently between 93-96. 

They gave me oral antibiotics and a nebulizer treatment. Pulse ox rose to 95 - 100 during treatment. Coughing got better but didn't stop

"Hi everyone, I'm 37 yr old male 160lbs 5'8 height I have no where else but here to go as I live in Canada and having access to Doctors specialist is almost impossible. Even if you're a millionaire you still can't find specialists because we have a social public crappy system.

So I need your opinion on my issues. I started doing the allergy shots in October 2020 which went well and I wasn't really getting any side effects. This was advised by my Allergy Doctor (who is never reachable).

6 months later I started having all kinds of issues that I didn't have before. First I started having dry eyes in March 2021 which could be due to me being all day in front of the screen for work. So I started doing all kinds of treatments but I'm still stuck with the problem. So I really didn't make a link with the Allergy shots.

Then at about the same time I started having bad acid reflux issues that never occurred in the past. This was foreign to me because it was the first time in my life that I felt heartburn. Again I thought maybe this was due to me drinking alcohol and having a really bad diet. So I changed my diet, stopped alcohol/cigarettes/coffee and lost 30 lbs. I somewhat manage the acid reflux/gerd well.

But now I have developed really bad asthma 2 months ago. I had an asthma attack in summer of 2021 which was again foreign to me. I never experienced that before. I wasnt using any inhalers and I took an antihistamine then and I was fine after. So now I have a feeling that I need to be on Alvesco forever because if I don't take the pump my shortness of breath is unbearable. Also I get really bad chest pain along with the shortness of breath.

I got one test for asthma in the summer (spirometry) and it came back negative. I'm having other tests in 2 weeks. I was checked for my chest pain and nothing was found in a scan. My Allergy doctor thinks I have asthma. My other general practitioner doctor thinks it's due to anxiety which I don't believe.

So my question is, do you guys think all of this might be due to the allergy shots? I have always been extremely sensitive to every medication I took in the past. I know allergy shots are not medication but maybe it messed up my immune system in some way and created all kinds of inflammation in my body. Disregulated my body in some way. Every single Doctor says that it can't be. But I feel we're still not that advanced medically. And everyone reacts differently to everything anyway. I took the decision today to stop the allergy shots."
"Hi everyone, I (23F) have a high pitched whistling sound upon exhale that never fully goes away. I am not diagnosed with asthma. 

It is typically very faint and sounds like soft multi-note whistling. Most times I can only hear it when it‚Äôs very quiet or I place my hand over my mouth and direct the sound to my ear. Other times it is so loud that those sitting next to me can hear. I am not currently aware of any triggers that may exacerbate the issue. 

I don‚Äôt use it very often, but I do have an albuterol inhaler that either minimizes or completely eliminates the noise. The whistling will return after a few hours and otherwise remain persistent. 

I‚Äôve searched the internet and it seems that there‚Äôs not much information about a whistling/wheezing that is active at all times. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any experience with this or any type of wheezing, and what attributes to it. Do you mind sharing your experience?

I had a Pulmonary Function Test, and a Laryngoscopy, both came back normal. Multiple doctors have listened to my lungs with a stethoscope, and they don‚Äôt hear any wheezing. 

I‚Äôm posting in the forum alongside a few others to hopefully hear about your experiences with wheezing, so I can draw better insights about this issue.

Background information: 

I am a former smoker and vaper. I smoked cigarettes and weed on/off for nearly a decade. I was more ‚Äúoff‚Äù than ‚Äúon‚Äù adding up to a total of about two years of daily use. I vaped daily for two and a half years, until I quit my nicotine addiction over a year ago.

I got very ill with a persistent, dry cough around the time I was vaping. This cough was resistant to cough syrup and felt like a whooping cough, often leaving me gagging and gasping for air. I also experienced a very itchy chin and jaw during the cough attacks that felt like a tingling rash on my skin but without any visible redness or marks. It seemed to get much worse if the air was dry, and a humidifier helped a bit. It lasted for months, subsided, and returned a few months later. I had a brief doctors appointment after months of debilitating cough attacks and was prescribed with antibiotics and the inhaler for ‚Äúatypical pneumonia‚Äù. The doctor made it very clear, however, that she wasn‚Äôt sure if that‚Äôs what I had and that its urgent for me to get a chest X-ray. I was out of insurance at the time, and couldn‚Äôt afford the $1000 chest scan, so I unfortunately never got it. I started taking the antibiotics and inhaler at the same time. The cough attacks disappeared within a few days and I don‚Äôt know which medication helped the most. Around this time is when I noticed the wheezing. Although I was no longer ill, I had a mild, persistent cough up until the time I quit vaping. I smoked weed nearly daily for a few months after quitting vaping but did not have any cough, and currently I have no cough as well. The wheezing persisted throughout, and is present 24/7 even now when I don‚Äôt smoke or vape."

Hello to anyone reading this. So I got diagnosed with asthma 12 years ago and got started on corticosteroids. Problem is when I started using this medication I got a rash known as Perioral Dermatitis which is a reaction to corticosteroids. At first I didn't know what caused the rash but got diagnosed 2 years ago. This rash has really been affecting affecting my well being. 

So my question to you is, does anyone else on this forum had this reaction to this medication and what did you do? I am also wondering if it would be advisable to discontinue my medication. I have been talking to my doctor and she says that my asthma is really quite mild (I have 84% in fev1). I have never had an asthma attack and my doctor also said I probably never will. So what do you think is it safe quitting my medication because my rash disappears?

Ps:Sorry for the long text and also any spelling or grammatical issues that may occur english is not my first language."
"I‚Äôve had asthma since i was about 4 and my mum is well aware of this since she was always there with me at the doctor‚Äôs office when i was having my tests. However when i stopped going swimming and running, my mum could no longer see how my asthma affected me since the only way she could tell before was that i would lose my breath during the sports. That meant that she just believed my asthma ‚Äúgot better‚Äù despite me telling her that no, the cold and strong scents and any form of exercise etc. make me unable to breathe, and she threw away all of my inhalers. On top of that, she now burns incredibly strong scented candles and incense for hours on end in multiple rooms in the house despite me asking her politely to blow them out because i literally can‚Äôt breathe. Yet she acts like i‚Äôm overreacting! She says that her candles ‚Äúaren‚Äôt that bad‚Äù so i should stop making such a big fuss over it because she‚Äôs ‚Äúonly had them burning an hour‚Äù, and even when i tell her that my lungs still don‚Äôt work just like they never have done so i can‚Äôt handle the scents that she doesn‚Äôt believe are strong, she just gets annoyed at me and ignores the fact that i have coughing fits or hyperventilate for hours due to her ‚Äúnot that strong‚Äù candles. I‚Äôm just so sick of her completely ignoring that i have a condition i can‚Äôt control and trying to blame me for it."

"My 5 year old is sick right now. In the middle of the night she wakes up coughing and doesn‚Äôt stop until she throws up. Last night it was white mucus, the night before it was dinner. After she throws up she stops coughing and falls back asleep. 

Any tips for stopping this? She only wakes up coughing while sick with a cold. She is on albuterol and flovent. I‚Äôve increased her albuterol and I also give this to her when she wakes at night. She has an air purifier and humidifier in her room."


"Hi all, I'm looking for some advice please. A few weeks ago I brought a warm mist humidifier to try and make the dry winter months a bit better for my partner who is asthmatic. I clean it throughly with white vinegar once a week to keep it clean, however the cleaning instructions mention using bleach also, I'm nervous to disinfect with bleach though as my partner is sensitive to chemicals and I'm worried if I can't strip the bleach properly it will come out in the mist and irritate their asthma further. Does anyone here use a humidifier? And what have you found to be the best way to clean it? Am I worrying too much? Any advice appreciated. Thank you."
"I've only been using Advair on a regular basis for a few months.  Thought I was rinsing enough after use, but obviously wasn't - although I've read sugar can be a factor as well - and had the thrush develop.  Used Nystatin liquid for a week (the Rx said 7-10 days)... should've done the full 10 days, but it seemed to be gone, was busy, and didn't keep it going.  Not sure how many days later it was, but it came back.  Am doing Nystatin again, plus had 1 refill.  Am obviously rinsing more now, also using a salt &amp; baking soda rinse sometimes. Anyone else have this experience, and do you have any tips on keeping it from coming back?  Thanks."
"I am currently in the process of being diagnosed with asthma, most likely exercise induced, after making an ER trip this weekend when I was struggling to catch my breath for 8+ hours. I was prescribed an inhaler before I went home and told to schedule a doctor's appointment for some testing.


My question is this; should I consider getting some sort of Medical Alert bracelet? The asthma attack(that's what the doctor called it)that I had was not so bad that I couldn't speak/explain what was happening, so I'm not sure if there's a need to get one.


Sorry if this sounds dumb.

"I‚Äôve always been having random moments where my chest is tight and I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs asthma. By chest tightness I mean that it‚Äôs hard for me to inhale and exhale deeply without it causing a ‚Äòspiking‚Äô pain. 
Is this asthma?"
Have you ever checked your blood O2 saturation when laying down? What are your lows and highs?
"Over the last two weeks I have used my inhaler multiple times a day for several days. I have allergy induced asthma and was around dogs when I should not have been which deeply affected my breathing for several days after, which it usually does. I am now sick, but it is a weird sickness; I have a mild cough and a headache and body fatigue mostly on my back near where my lungs would be. This is not the first time this sort of illness has come about, after having a bout of overusing my inhaler. 

I tested for covid and came out negative so that is definitely not it. 

It could be just a regular cold or something coming on that I caught from the general public but I wondered if this has happened to other people???? Would an overdose manifest for several days like this? 

Since I have experienced this before I thought it could be related to abusing my albuterol inhaler. 

Sorry if these are stupid questions I just really don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶"

"I was more recently diagnosed with allergy induced asthma in my adult life. It was never too bad and a puff or two of the rescue inhaler could solve my mild symptoms. Until one weekend night I couldn't sleep, and was having a pretty bad asthma attack which I never had before (I think a lot of my triggers were present the day or so before). Long story short  I got on some steroids (Prednisone), but once it wore off it acted up again so I was prescribed an daily steroid inhaler similar to advair. I've also been on monlukast and things to help with allergies. 
But my concern is that things might not be better even after weeks of consistent medication. My %spO2 ranges from 95%-97% which is in the OK range so my specialist think I'm doing fine (along with some breathing test). However I don't feel back to normal and I can't seem exercise or even walk very long with out feeling out of breath. And I'm pretty sure my spO2 was higher before this. 

This is very disheartening to me and I feel kind of hopeless and depressed that things progressed downward so fast... I guess my question to y'all is what should I do? Or what helped you if you were in a similar situation? My doctor mentioned that x-rays might be the logical next step, should I push for that?

PS, I've been doing breathing exercises, which feel nice but don't seem to create effects that make my breathing progressively better."
"All those which are form the UK. I would love some advice. I was told by the Covid 119 helpline that given I am asthmatic I am high risk and so eligible for a booster. 

I had my second dose back in May and so I'm keen to get the booster. They told me I should reach out to my GP as they should send me a letter of eligibility for the booster. However, I have not and when I called the GP she said I am not eligible on their system and they can't change it from their end? 

I am 22 years old. Is any one else in a similar situation? Please can you advise?"
"Hello Reddit!

I am a 19 year old male who has had asthma and allergies my whole life and I am checked by a pulmonologist. Since April 2021 I have been suffering from tightness and chest pain, a feeling of a dot in my throat as well as sudden fatigue when it happens. I am here to ask for help, and for that I think I need to quickly summarize the situation.

During my teenage years, the symptoms of asthma almost completely disappeared for me. I was on Relvar 92 mcg and Rhinomaxil 100 mcg but it was like I didn't have asthma, I didn't even take my rescue inhaler with me anymore. I just forgot what asthma was.

I started smoking when I was about 16 (I feel so bad about it, what an idiot) but it didn't change my relationship with asthma. At this point it's 2018, I smoke a little on weekends until 2020 and covid, where I'm home from confinements. At this point I start smoking a lot, more and more. This lasts until January 2021.

At this time I notice that after smoking I have difficulty breathing, not much but I feel it. I take out my inhaler that I had forgotten, take a breath, go to sleep (I always smoked in the evening, late) and the next day it was forgotten. But the same pattern repeated itself in the evening. This continued until April, with the difference that little by little the blocking sensation got worse. Instead of just taking my inhaler, I also take my Relvar treatment (which I don't have to do at all outside the prescribed doses). It helps me, I go to sleep and in the morning I feel better. But I still smoke.

But in that same month, one night, it doesn't help me. I stress and google. I imagine myself dying, and that triggers my first big panic attack. I call the emergency services and they take me to the hospital by ambulance and I undergo multiple tests: chest scan, blood work, double covid test, electrocardiogram, blood oxygenation. Nothing abnormal, I am fine according to them. I haven't smoked since.

Over the next three months, I went to see my doctor and my pulmonologist. They modified my Relvar treatment by increasing the dose and gave me antihistamines and I had an MRI of the thoracic cage which gave nothing.

The problem is that it doesn't help me, I have a permanent thoracic oppression which gives me sometimes pains in the same place and I am always like swollen, I have difficulty to breathe, I am sometimes breathless, I have like a point in the throat which appears from time to time which makes me yawn enormously and tires me much. 

I put it down to anxiety, but I just don't believe it anymore. I'm looking for reasons and especially solutions, asthma is number one. Do you have any ideas to help me? I am in so much pain, I want to get out of this. In April I thought it would be over after the summer, but it's almost Christmas and it's been the same since.

Sorry this is so long, I'm not sure how to word my message for help so I summarized as much as I could but it's still a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Permanent chest tightness, difficulty breathing, from time to time a spot in my throat that makes me yawn and tired, appeared after smoking for 3 years. I stopped since then. Several medical tests without results. I am asthmatic on medication, I am looking for solutions. Thank you for your help.**"
"I had covid over a year ago and havent needed an inhaler since. My Asthma was typically induced by cold excersize and dogs/cats. I still get allergies from pets but I haven't ""needed"" an inhaler in over a year. I use to use it daily/weekly year round and more often in the winter. Did I grow out of asthma or did covid change something with my lungs?"
"Obviously, I need to talk to my MD and I am waiting for a call back but has anyone experienced that montelukast has just all of a sudden stopped working for them? I'm back to my inhaler once a day.  Waiting for a call back from my doctor but wondering if anyone has had a similar issue? If so, what did you change that worked for you? I'm not sure if the change into the cold weather is the culprit but montelukast worked for me in the summer."

"Looking for advice about dealing with mold with asthma. We just purchased a house, but won't be able to move until February. In the meantime (and while we were house hunting), we are renting a room in another house. Unbeknownst to us, the house we are currently renting/living in has a mold issue. At first we thought it was just bad ventilation in the bathroom and we scrubbed all the mold out with commercial grade cleaner. Now we've discovered mold coming through the air vent in the middle of the house. 

Obviously the best course of action is to not be exposed to mold at all, but we're already paying 2 rents/mortgages and can't afford a 3rd, so we're stuck until we can move in February. It seems unlikely our landlord is going to do anything about any internal mold damage in the house anytime soon. 

So I'm looking for advice if there's anything you have found to help reduce your symptoms from mold allergies/asthma? I am unfortunately highly allergic and my asthma has gradually gotten worse each month we've lived here and I'm pretty sure I have a constant chest infection at this point. My doctor changed my inhaler (which helped slightly), and I'm also currently on antihistamines, nasal spray, lung health supplements, CBD gummies, and occasionally benadryl, and we also invested in an air purifier, but I'm still wheezing and coughing. Anything else you would recommend trying? Or any other suggestions for limiting the mold in the house?"
Ive not been diagnosed with asthma but I have been having a slew of weird symptoms that suck and I recently started using Xopenex and it helps with some of the chest pain and sob. But I have also been getting a tingling in my chest when I breathe. Especially when trying to sleep. I was just curious if anyone with asthma experiences this.
"Hi guys, I have quite a weird case imo, but thought maybe someone had smth similar.

So, I didn't have any problems previously, after covid in nov 2020 I had some chest tightness which resolved after breathing exercises, then in feb I did xray and spirometry, my xray was fine, but spirometry showed mild obstruction. I didn't have any issues as such, it didn't really bother me, just some occasional difficulties breathing here and there which disappeared fast, but in june I had to take abx and after 3 days my breathing started to get progressively worse. It was so bad I couldn't be in heat, couldn't sleep, felt tired very fast and light-headed and dizzy. No medication so far helped me with this issue, I was prescribed glucocorticoids but the difference was almost not noticeable. Pulmonologist sent me to get tested for parasites as well, but I haven't done it yet. It isn't like an attack, I just have persistent trouble breathing and it won't go away. What also strange is that I did spirometry in feb when I felt okay, and in july when it was bad, and my indicators didn't change as such, however I feel WAY worse.

I now will get checked for parasites and hpylori, because some ppl with this bacteria also had trouble breathing. 

PS: I didn't have covid in june, I had CT scan and it was all fine. So far I'm diagnosed with ""lung obstruction of unknown genesis"". 

Any ideas what it can be? Really appreciate. After 5 months I almost don't believe I'll be able to breath normally ever again. Really makes you check your values. Sorry for a little vent."

[ Asthma increases whenever humidity in the atmosphere increases. Asthma worsens in damp conditions and after eating anything related to water.

"My daughter was having an asthma attack, she currently has a cold. I rubbed 4000mg hemp lotion aka CBD on her neck, throat, chest and back. It was probably about a tsp overall. Her attack instantly stopped. That‚Äôs a first. She had already taken her albuterol and couldn‚Äôt have another dose for three more hours. Anyone else use CBD to treat asthma?"
Does anyone have any recommendations for getting the humidity up indoors? Even with a vaporizer going 24/7 the air in my room is still too dry and my airways are suffering because of it.
"Im pretty sure I have asthma and am going to the doctor to get tested/diagnosed for asthma next week. So when I get tested, will I find out how severe or mild my asthma is? Also, what tests do I have to do when they check to see if I even have asthma?"
"Seems like when I use albuterol regularly, I end up craving it/feeling like I need it regularly.

I recently was using a primatine mist inhaler because I couldn't get an albuterol, and I found myself using it quite a bit less than my albuterol.

Does anyone have experience with this? I feels like the more I use albuterol, the more I feel like I need it, to the point of overuse."
"Has anyone had a bad reaction to the meds they give you? I was born in the 80‚Äôs and was born with asthma and have been on/off steroids, inhailers, and the neb my whole life. As I got older I noticed my teeth starting to died i guess is the best way to put it. I found out that the meds had caused my teeth to become extremely weak and now I need dental implants due to my teeth just shattering as I grew older."
"I started using Advair last summer after a run in high humidity gave me a month-long exacerbation that didn‚Äôt respond to prednisone. Since then, my health insurance (USA) has been giving it to me at a copay of around $20, while continually threatening to up the price to the ballpark of $160-$230 (each time they sent me the notification, it was a different amount). I finally went to pick it up earlier this week and found the pharmacy wanted to charge me $187. The pharm tech kindly pointed it out to me (in case I hadn‚Äôt seen) and did clarify that this was after running it through the insurance. 

Well, my medical care is all associated with a local public hospital network, and they kept mentioning to me that their pharmacy is cheaper, and I‚Äôve used them a couple times when I was in the building anyway, but overall their location isn‚Äôt very convenient for me. But now that they wanted to charge me over a hundred bucks for one month of one medicine, I had my prescription transferred over to them. It‚Äôs going to cost me $14. That‚Äôs right, 1/10th the cost. Socialist medicine within a capitalist society for the win! 

So to anyone who has high copays on medicine after insurance, check out if you have any local hospital pharmacies nearby, especially if the hospital is a public hospital. And if that doesn‚Äôt help enough, also try GoodRX (that was going to be my next stop after the hospital pharmacy). 

Good luck!"

"About 6 weeks ago, I switched from Zenhale to Alvesco and Oxeeze Turbuhaler because of systemic effects from the Zenhale.

I use a spacer for the Alvesco but can‚Äôt with Oxeeze (I think?), practice good oral hygiene, rinse my mouth after use, etc. I am going to be trying Biotene mouth wash for rinsing to help with the apparent dryness.

Yet, in winter, I cannot stop it. I don't smoke, I'm as healthy as a chronically ill person can be, and I keep my social circle very small to avoid scaring people: yet it isn't enough.

Yes, I know it is deep and heavy sounding. Yes, I know it's scary for your to hear. No, I do not have covid. No, I am not sick with anything contagious. No, I am not a goddamn plague rat like you think I am.

I just wanna be able to go out in public without being glared at and yelled at for existing with a lung disease. Fuck me for wanting to go sit in a coffee shop like everyone else- must just be a bad person who's spreading the virus. Fuck me for going out for a walk on warmer days- must wanna infect my neighbors.

How do y'all deal with the glares from everyone? At this point I just go to work (where my coworkers know I have asthma and are very chill about it) then come home because I'm so sick of being looked at like I'm a plague-carrying monster. I even order my groceries and uber eats my food if I wanna treat my partner and I to something so we don't have to sit in a restaurant and risk those looks. I just wanna be able to go outside again without fearing being yelled at by random people because none of them wanna stop and consider that maybe, just maybe, there are problems besides covid that people deal with.

I'm so tired."

"I've had COVID-induced asthma for the past six months, so I'm still trying to figure out how to manage it. I hadn't had any asthma attacks for a month straight (which is unusual for me). Last I got a bit too caught up in angry emotion. I was alone, and took it out on my pillow. Just had to let out some pent up stuff, as one does. But for some reason it triggered an asthma attack. I guess I just got too worked up. It wasn't a severe attack, only moderate. But it was bad enough that I felt like I was going to die (thought that was probably just due to feeling panicked). Took me a while to feel normal again. I'm wondering, Has anyone else noticed that getting too emotional (angry) can trigger an asthma attack? Usually my triggers are strong scented cleaning agents (especially rubbing alcohol/swabs), cardio exercise, lifting heavy things, and sometimes singing. I'm afraid of having another attack if I need to release anger upon my pillow again in the future. It was the worst attack in a while, and I really want to avoid having another like it. I use Albuterol, which is definitely helpful (but could probably benefit from meds)."

Hi guys I just wanted to post to this thread about a wheeze that has been bothering me so much! I went to a pulmonary doctor about a year ago and he gave me a spirometery test and I completed it when he came back with the results the machine stated that I had asthma but he then went on to tell me that he thinks it‚Äôs allergies and not asthma. Both of my parents have really bad allergies so I guess that can make sense in a way but I also have really bad health anxiety so after I left the pulmonary doctor I was fine for like a month and then I kept hearing the wheezing and went to a normal doctor this time and he told me the same thing that he believes it is allergies because he couldn‚Äôt hear wheezing from my lungs. My only symptoms I have is a wheeze on exhale and clear/white phlegm in the mornings and I get a stuffed up nose hear and there it comes and goes. it‚Äôs recurrent wheezing and he also stated the he believed that the wheezing was coming from my trachea/throat so my question to you guys is do you think it‚Äôs asthma or allergies does anyone here with allergies or asthma have the same symptoms? I‚Äôve also never felt asthma attack nor do I know what they feel like so that‚Äôs another reason why I think it might be allergies and not asthma.

I am a moderate-to-severe asthma sufferer and I am just about to move to a new apartment with 100% wool carpeting (low pile). For my medical condition I am allergic to dust mite and mold. I have seen contradictory information online regarding whether wool is asthma friendly - some state that wool can  prevent the accumulation of dust mites and some suggest that wool carpet could be dangerous for allergy sufferers. 

Has anyone asked their doctor on wool carpets or is anyone with asthma current living with wool carpets?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much!"

"My asthma flared last week with the arrival of snow in England, and today and Monday I have had brown phlegm along side normal asthma symptoms. Has anyone else had this?"
"Hi all,
I am a 26f, previously completely healthy but for the past 3 months I have suffered from dyspnea, tight chest, very deep dry cough (like a life long smoker, even though I don‚Äôt smoke), fatigue, when it gets too bad then also trouble swallowing (guess when you can‚Äôt breathe, you can‚Äôt swallow). In a moving car (even as a passenger) the chest tightness gets much worse. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs anxiety, I‚Äôve been a driver for many years. It started about 3 weeks after my second covid vaccine (and I also had different side effects after first and second vaccine which thankfully went away). I am not here to wage war against the vaccine but it‚Äôs a possible cause so I am mentioning it.
When I sleep, everything‚Äôs more or less okay. I‚Äôve been to many doctors (ORL, cardiologist, neurologist,‚Ä¶) and hospitals with no results but still waiting for lung CT and lung tests. I think most of my symptoms point to undiagnosed asthma but I have no wheezing and maybe that‚Äôs why the doctors haven‚Äôt thought about it yet. But I also read that silent asthma exists.
What do you think? It‚Äôs severely impacting my life (I don‚Äôt leave the house anymore, and I can‚Äôt drive because of the symptoms) and I need some reassurance. Thanks! :)"
"I would like to go and just live there for a few weeks/months and get treated. Is there such a place in Europe? like a ""spa/retreat"" for asthma people?"
"I was diagnosed w/ adult asthma 2+ years ago and it‚Äôs been a bewildering journey. I have an excellent pulmonary doctor and have been feeling well for 6 months until 3 days ago. Fumes  from the over took my breath away and I‚Äôve been coughing ever since. Days of non stop coughing and lungs are in pain. I feel weak, break out in cold sweat and bed ridden.. 

This is the first time I‚Äôve been triggered by fumes. Wondering if this is a normal reaction for  asthmatics to feel wiped and bed ridden  after asthma attacks? Btw, I have nebulizer, prosit, symbacort, and Singular. Thank you."
"Hey all, I figured I‚Äôd make this post taking about this allergy treatment. I didn‚Äôt know something like this existed till recently and it‚Äôs helped cure my allergies. I am not sponsored or anything but it seems like a lot of people don‚Äôt know about it. 


Anyway the treatment is offered in only certain places. It pretty much consists of you picking 3 allergens (only 3 non food related). For example cat dander, pollens and dust mites can be picked. Once you have them picked out (you‚Äôll have to do an allergy test to determine what you‚Äôre allergic to obviously) they‚Äôll have you get off of any allergy pills for three days. 


The treatment itself will consist of you coming in. Taking your pants/ undies off and with an ultrasound they‚Äôll look for your lymph node in your inner thigh (think where your leg and your crotch meet). From there they‚Äôll inject the allergy serum and that‚Äôs the end of the treatment itself. You‚Äôll have to bring an epi pen just in case bc you might get a reaction and they‚Äôll observe you for an hour to see if you have any reactions and that‚Äôs it. 


You‚Äôll end up coming in around like 3 times total and if you still have a retraction to those allergens they‚Äôll just schedule you for subsequent treatments. According to them that doesn‚Äôt happen often. Also around 80% of people are curable but not all. 



The treatment is around 2500 plus additional fees for allergy testing done prior but that part might be covered by your insurance. The treatment itself is not covered by insurance. Also if you want to treat the other allergens you might have you have to pay an additional 1500 and that will take care of 3 more allergens. 


As for my symptoms I‚Äôm pretty much cured. I had a cat that was killing me. None of my meds were working and it was to the point I was considering giving her back. Thankfully this did the trick and I can pretty much rub my cat all over with zero symptoms and she gets to stay. 


If you guys have questions let me know and I‚Äôll be happy to answer them. 


Also as a side note this does not cure any food allergy. Food allergies are treated differently."
"Hello! My wife was recently pretty sick (Covid negative) and that is what made me look up and join this group, in order to gain some knowledge about her health issue. Her triggers are cats, dogs, some seasonal, colder weather and ESPECIALLY respiratory viruses. 

We end up in the ER or at a walk in clinic 1-2 times per year. She is on a preventative and a rescue inhaler and does well on them. When things get ‚Äúout of hand‚Äù and she can‚Äôt get things under control she needs 1-2 prednisone and she snaps right out of it and she‚Äôs back to normal. 

With her recent respiratory virus that she had it took her multiple days of taking prednisone and we assume she was having some reactions to the other medications that she was prescribed (mucus medication and ib profen) so she stopped taking them and it cleared up by the next day. 


Anyways, enough background. I‚Äôm obviously no doctor so I can‚Äôt diagnose. I also have little knowledge about asthma but I notice a few things every time we end up at a hospital or walk in. She always has 99 oxygen sat, her lungs are clear, no wheezing and the doctor always looks a little surprised/stunped(?). I guess I should mention that when my wife is having a hard time breathing that it is not in her lungs, It‚Äôs in her throat. So my questions are - does anyone experience something similar? Is it possible that she should see a specialist in an attempt to better understand what‚Äôs going on or do you have any recommendation/advice? 

Thanks in advance to the responses, I‚Äôm looking forward to better understanding what‚Äôs going on and sharing your responses with my wife."
"**disclaimer: this is not for/about me. this is general curiosity. my asthma is not bad enough to need this, but i am involved in the dog community, so it‚Äôs interesting***

does anyone have a service dog for their asthma? what tasks do they perform? how ‚Äúbad‚Äù is your asthma to have wanted one?


FYI: there is no regulation/registry for service dogs. all a service dog has to do is directly assist you with a disability by doing 2 or more tasks. your disability has to be severe enough to affect at least 1 major life tasks."
I was JUST diagnosed yesterday and I'm still getting the hang of this. I accidently inhaled through my nose for split second and then blocked my nose immediately to inhale properly. Should i be worried? I sent a message to my pharmacist friend but he hasnt responded yet. I panic easily.
"I‚Äôve long suspected it but hadn‚Äôt thought of it actively until today, when I ended up in tears in the nurse‚Äôs office because a kid chucked a pencil at my head. 

I get these awful spasms when I cry that make it difficult to stop, like hiccups almost. Today in the nurse‚Äôs office, I managed to recall that suspicion and asked for an inhaler, and it helped but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because using it forced me to slow my breathing or because I was actually having an ‚Äúasthma attack.‚Äù

Do y‚Äôall know anything about this?"
"I have exercise induced asthma and I play high intensity sports in the cold a fair bit. I was wondering if anyone has any tips to prevent my asthma acting up? I was thinking of bringing a thermos of hot coffee which could maybe relieve my symptoms?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
Stressed out and purchased the wrong symbicort inhaler at my local CVS. Wrong prescription and cost 120 dollars. They wont accept a return so anyone looking for one or know what I can do about it that would be helpful. Thanks
"I have grown up with asthma my hole life but it was always triggered by something (being around smokers, being around cats, running, etc.). I haven't had an asthma attack in about 6 years because I've removed all the triggers from my life. My last attack was at a party of a friend of a friend. I didn't realize they had a cat in the house and I ended up having to leave after about 20 minutes. 

I would like to get a cat as a companion and was just wondering if anyone has had any luck with allergy shots? Do they help with asthma triggers?"
"Growing up, asthama was a close friend. No cold-drinks, no ice-cream, no curd (reactant in my case) and the worst - NO FRUITS! It was bad. Also included was no playing in the park after 6-7 (during winters). A lot of these restrictions stayed with me till I reached late mid-teenage. It has been better now. I almost didn't need an inhaler for 3-4 years! I have since played outdoor sports to my heart's content, saved up and bought my favorite fruits, and the elephant on my chest had now moved to a unattended corner of my mind. Until 2019. I moved to a city to continue higher studies, and the air quality didn't do me good. I was reunited with wheezing and coughing. Also, I got lost in studies and got disconnected from sports totally, so my stamina went crashing down (can't jog half a mile without almost fainting). I gained some weight, but my immunity took a plunge. Since 2019 end, I've had to start using inhalers regularly (upto thrice a week). And all the feelings of restriction and 'doom' have returned. I've since finished my schooling and moved away from that place. In my village, fresh air is a blessing. 

But all in all, through all those nights of me not being able to catch a breath and my mom by my side, worried sick, comforting me, my dad on the phone the whole night (when it was paid by the minute!), going to sleep in my bed, and the next thing I remember I have an oxygen mask on; I found sympathy and I found love. But I never found someone to relate to. No one I knew other than me had Asthama. And since I've joined Reddit, and started having breathing problems again, I found this sub. It's wild to instantly find other people who have had similar, if not the same life experiences as me. Maybe we have different triggers (one I have is cockroach poop), maybe we are on different medication, surely we're of different age groups, and the intensity of our suffering is also varied immensely, but what I do know is at some point we have all tried our best but failed to take a damn breath in. And it sucks. 

But hey, atleast I don't have to explain it to you."
"I take wixela 250/50 twice a day and my asthma is generally well controlled with it. I almost never need my inhaler, except for when I run where I usually get asthma attacks. I definitely take puffs of albuterol before (I've even tried using a nebulizer before) but it doesn't stop the attack from coming. The good thing for me is that once I get asthma, albuterol will eventually stop the attack and after 20 minutes from initial onset I'm fine and now won't get another attack for basically the rest of that run/exercise session. 

Still, it's tough to have to stop after running for 2 minutes due to asthma, particularly when I had been running without asthma successfully earlier in the year and even significantly improved my cardio so that when I don't have asthma I can easily run a 5k.

Would biologics help? A higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids? Something else?"
"Hi everyone for the last two months I‚Äôve had this cough and it isn‚Äôt a sick cough and I haven‚Äôt been sick. I talk to my doctor about it and he said it‚Äôs due to my anxiety so I thought OK it‚Äôs my anxiety. 
But now that I‚Äôve been on my anti-anxiety meds for about two months my anxiety has lessened but my cough just keeps getting worse and it‚Äôs more like a wheezing cough. 
I feel like it gets worse at night and in my house when I‚Äôm out and about it‚Äôs not that bad. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs asthma or may be an allergy like my cats or possible mold. I‚Äôve never had this issue before but it‚Äôs starting to freak me out. 
I go to the doctor on Tuesday to get a diagnosis because I told them it‚Äôs definitely more than anxiety. I‚Äôm 25 and have never had issues like this before is it possible to get asthma later on in life?"
"Hi all, i‚Äôve been asthmatic for about 2/3 years now it was before covid and i became asthmatic by a illness (really bad viral infection).

Long story :
I was took into hospital and they thought i had meningitis and thankfully it was not that but it turned out it was a bad viral infection and got let out do hospital and spent the next weeks throwing up and coughing and wheezing but never thought anything of it but when i went to do sports i could not breathe so i got tested and was told i an asthmatic"
"I have my 4th chest infection of the year and was sent to A&amp;E yesterday by my GP where they did nebuliser treatment and I was sent home a few hours later with Prednisolone. Every time I have it, I get so so nauseous and dread taking it. I have mentioned this in hospital a few times but they keep giving it to me. Does anyone else experience this?"
"Hi! I just came back from the doctor, where we discussed my new lung function test. It's at 75%, and I've had issues with asthma since I was 11. This time the doctor told me that I don't have asthma, but just 'impaired lung function' (is that the english word? lol) I was surprised, but he told me that since my issue i breathing IN, and in asthma the issue is breathing OUT, it wasn't asthma. But now that I've gone home and thought more about my symptoms, I'm confused:

My breathing gets worse when I'm around cats and when I get allergies from dustmites. It gets worse when I do physical activities, especially in cold weather. I have difficulties breathing when I've been laughing too much. I often cough, and it might be slimy lol. 

This all seem very asthmatic, as far as I understand the symptoms. Should I contact my doctor again? I feel dumb for forgetting to mention all these symptoms, but he didn't ask.. Have any of you been told the same?"

[ What is the Relationship Between Asthma and Hay Fever? ](https://preview.redd.it/em5mt15kg4381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2b3fe623d5b7349c20060a363117fbba6e38a25)

The arrival of spring brings joy for many of us, but it also brings allergies! As the lawns bloom with colors and the trees become greener, the allergies also start kicking in people. But the real struggle is for the people who get allergens that trigger hay fever also trigger asthma in them.  


You may wonder what allergens that cause hay fever have in common with asthma other than being miserable. The answer is a lot. The substances that trigger hay fever can also cause asthma signs and symptoms in some people.   


**Relation Between The Two**  
When antibodies mistakenly identify a harmless substance, such as tree pollen, as an invader, it binds itself to the allergen to protect you. This causes hay fever symptoms, which include nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes, and skin reactions. In some people, this also leads to asthma symptoms. This is also known as allergic bronchitis.   


**Chronic Bronchitis**  
Inflammation around the lining of bronchial tubes that carry air from the nose and mouth to the lungs is called Bronchitis. Similarly, asthma is a lung condition that causes breathing difficulties and causes inflammation around the bronchi. Symptoms of hay fever can trigger asthmatic bronchitis.  


**Asthma Treatment**  
There is no permanent solution for asthma, but various medications can help in reducing the symptoms of asthma. Most of the asthma medications are in the form of inhalers or nebulisers.   


These treatments allow the medicine to go directly to your lungs. If you have allergic asthma, ensure that you use an inhaler regularly and check in with your local pharmacist to get Clenil Inhaler Online UK as we get into hay fever season.  


**Key Takeaway**   
Allergies can be annoying, but what is more annoying is getting asthma with allergens. As the spring season is loved by most, it is not the best time of the year for people who get infected easily. If you are one of those people, take precautions and talk to your local pharmacist for the best inhaler. [**Spiriva Inhaler Online UK**](https://www.pharmacyplanet.com/spiriva.html) and [**Symbicort inhaler online**](https://www.pharmacyplanet.com/symbicort-turbohaler.html) can be great for you in the season of allergies."
For example: stopping Flovent and starting Symbicort. Should taper off Flovent before starting Symbicort or can use Symbicort after 12 or 24 hours after stopping Flovent?
"2 months into taking Singulair, had an overwhelming sense of fatigue and tiredness during the day. Been off it for 2-3 days now and while the physical fatigue is more or less gone, this massive depression has hit. The last time I was this depressed was a chemically induced depression due to antibiotics messing with meds for a brain tumor. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? I‚Äôve been reading that a lot of people got depressed while on them, but haven‚Äôt seen much about people getting depressed after being off them."

"Honestly not sure if I just have bad allergies or if it's asthma or what.

As a kid I had a problem where when I would get sick I would recover after about a week or so but my lungs would take literally months to return to normal. I would be coughing up a storm, especially when I exercised. But then it would go away for a while only to return when I got sick again. It never felt overly dangerous levels of coughing but my teachers would always be pretty worried about it, because the coughs sounded like I was dying lol. Anyways that kind of went away during my teen years, I still got pretty bad coughs when I would get sick but it wouldn't last months and it wasn't anywhere near as bad as it was as a kid.

Now I'm 25 and about two years ago I started getting lung problems, like shortness of breath, coughing, and occasional chest pains. The coughing and shortness of breath would always appear pretty suddenly, last about an hour or two then go away. It's never super bad to where I am overly worried but there has been a few times I thought this could be scary if it got any worse. My nose also tends to immediately become runny once the coughing starts, and I do cough up mucus pretty frequently during this.

I have had my lungs checked for cancer among many other things and the doc has said, I either am getting recurrent inflammation, have bad allergies or I might have asthma. What do you guys think? Does this sound similar to your experiences? I'm debating whether I should see a specialist instead of my GP and if I should be worried at all."
"*Asthma symptoms during exercise/cold weather/when sick but no official dx (aka no meds)

However, we did a team building exercise today during our staff meeting (scooter boards meets dodge ball), which triggered a coughing attack ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Never a good thing during COVID times. No one said anything but I did get a lot of looks."
"I only have tightness when I breathe in, is that asthma or something else. I can breathe out just fine but it‚Äôs like I can breathe in but then there‚Äôs a lock on my lungs"

I remember someone posting about the ‚Äútrifecta‚Äù of allergy meds outside our asthma meds.  I can‚Äôt remember what it was. Any help?

" 

I saw people post online 13 years ago about toxic laundry detergent, softeners, and dryer sheets.¬† After 13 years, we're still talking about it,¬†no laws ban it.¬† Our voices are too weak to be heard, or they do hear but they don't care.¬†¬†I¬†contacted¬†the American¬†Lung¬†Association; they replied to me that¬†they can't stop people from using scented laundry products.¬†¬†With such an¬†attitude, how they can protect people's lung health.¬†  
In fact, the artificial fragrances¬†in many of laundry products do not provide any cleaning benefit but do contribute to¬†asthma,¬†cancers,¬†migraine headaches, dizziness,¬†rashes, multiple chemical sensitivities, sinus allergies, and other respiratory illnesses.  
   
A study from Washington¬†State University¬†([https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723134438.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080723134438.htm))¬†reveals that scented laundry detergents and dryer sheets are laced with two carcinogens such as benzene which¬†has¬†a¬†somewhat¬†sweet smell and acetaldehyde¬†both of¬†which the EPA says should not be inhaled¬†and¬†can raise your cancer risks.¬† Through the dryer vents, at high temperatures, the toxic chemicals are emitted¬†into the outside air, becoming even more lethal, even¬†if¬†we close¬†our windows,¬†the smells are still coming in and lingering in the air.¬†¬†  
We can pick up different¬†food,¬†but we have no choice but to share the same air, even it's lethal pollution.¬†People¬†have been inhaling¬†toxic chemicals for much of their lives.¬†¬†We are literally being poisoned and killed softly, slowly by these emitted chemical products.  
   
Workers in¬†factories¬†with¬†pollution have very¬†high cancer¬†rates.¬†Workers at¬†power plants,¬†chemical plants,¬†and¬†paper manufacturing plants commonly have liver cancer, blood cancer, lung cancer,¬†and¬†pancreatic cancer,¬†as well as other health issues.¬†¬†I believe¬†that¬†cancer rates in the laundry detergent¬†factories¬†must be very high too.  
Some people might think it's nothing, but they should understand that it really is a big deal.  
Please think about¬†all the¬†people getting sick¬†unnecessarily.¬†¬†Cancers, asthma, lung fibrosis,¬†and other¬†health issues could be prevented.¬†¬†Prevention is the important thing. Instead of¬†dealing with¬†these diseases,¬†often¬†not even knowing how we got them,¬†we should take¬†precautions as a society and rid¬†our neighborhoods and our world of these dangerous and unnecessary¬†chemicals.¬†  
   
Here is a link to¬†Dr. Anne Steinemann's website on this subject.¬†¬†[https://www.drsteinemann.com/home2.html](https://www.drsteinemann.com/home2.html)  Dr. Steinmann is Professor of Engineering at James Cook University, Australia, and Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Melbourne, Australia.¬† Hopefully, after you've¬†read what she writes,¬†you'll change your mind and fight back together.  
A bill should be sponsored that would restrict the use of scents in consumer¬†products (especially where they serve no purpose except cause health risks).¬†¬†

"I have been using my Wixela inhaler twice daily for a couple months. I went to the doctor and got them to refill my prescription. The pharmacy filled my other prescriptions and then said that my Wixela prescription required Prior Authorization and would take longer. I contacted my doctor, the pharmacy, and my insurance multiple times to try to figure out why insurance wasn't covering the medication. The doctor's office said they sent everything they needed when I first called. Then the pharmacy said they hadn't received anything paperwork related from the doctor's and said the doctor's had been ignoring their calls. My insurance (Cigna) told me on the phone they need to prescribe Advair inhaler first to cover the brand name and not the generic version Wixela. I'm confused because I was prescribed Wixela in the past and never ran into these issues. Online through Cigna's website it says they don't cover Advair and only the generic version Wixela, which seems to conflict everything they told me on the phone.

So pretty much 3 weeks has gone by since my visit to the doctor and they still haven't resolved the situation. Doctor has ignored pharmacies calls. Prior authorization hasn't been taken care of yet. They said they put in a note and it may take up to 14 days (said the same thing the last time I called as well) but said they would try to expedite it since I had been waiting and it's urgent and causing me daily asthma attacks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm feeling pretty hopeless. Having asthma attacks everyday. Why do I need prior authorization for an asthma inhaler that is life saving medicine?! This is outrageous. Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? 

Am I able to sue my doctor/insurance for causing daily asthma attacks for their negligence for 21 days?"


"21F. Today I woke up with mild shortness of breath and chest pain, although my other symptoms seem to be improving. My oxygen levels are at 98% and a nurse came and listened to my breathing (I'm in college so in isolation housing) and told me it sounded fine. However, I'm a bit concerned about this since I had mild asthma (haven't had bad asthma in years but I take an inhaler as needed and was hospitalized for it a few times as a kid-the last time was in 2010). I was out of my inhaler prescription when I tested positive, and I didn't get access to the inhalers until today. I just took the inhalers but honestly I feel slightly worse, although the shortness of breath is still fairly mild. I'm not sure if I'm worrying too much or if I should get in contact with a doctor. I'm 21 years old, ran a half marathon, no conditions other than my mild asthma, double vaccinated. Honestly, this disease is so scary."
"Hello, new here.   My 3 1/2 year old song has started showing signs of what i belive to be asthma. The doctors are not keen to diagnosis it as this due to his age etc.    They have however given me a orange inhaler with Ventolin to be taken just before bed only.   Things started to get worse over the next few days, after he runs around for 5 mins he starts an uncontrollable cough untill he is physically sick. Called the doctors again and got the go ahead to give him Ventolin if it was to get to the stage where he cant stop caughing.    Seems to help.   I have video for evidence to take to the doctors next time.    Could i share the video here and get peoples thoughts on it?"
"My son is 13 and has asthma. I would say its mild - moderate. Mostly only a problem if he gets sick with a cold. Then its a few days of cold symptoms and then the asthma kicks in where he is wheezing and coughing for another week or 2. Now he's having trouble sleeping. He says he just wakes up all night. He's asking for a sleeping pill - like a Tylenol PM. Or maybe Nyquil? I have let him have one occasionally but I'm worried about giving it while he also is having trouble breathing? He's been taking his nebulizer every 4 hours and he's also on Qvar but he is not very good at remembering to take that. I try to remind him, but I'm not perfect at remembering even though I leave his inhaler right on his desk so he has to see it while playing video games every day...to be clear he's acting fine and even though he stayed home from school he played video games all day long. So its not like he's near death or anything, I just can't send him to school when he's coughing in these Covid times. I did bring him for a Covid test just in case, but will have to wait for those results.

Just looking for ideas on helping him get some sleep. Maybe try sleeping with his head elevated a bunch?"
"I just recovered from a really awful bout of bronchitis that lasted a few weeks, and was using my nebulizer during that time. Should I throw out the tubing, masks, and medicine cups that I used during that time, just to be safe? Or should I just really thoroughly clean them? The last thing I need is to get sick again. I was washing them in a large bowl of soap and hot water, but I feel like that might not be enough."
The last month or so I‚Äôve had an ongoing flare up. At times it would go away and I‚Äôd feel like my normal self but then I‚Äôd wake up in the middle of the night needing my inhaler and this pattern would continue for a few days. My doctor has decided to up my Advair dose from 100/50 to 250/50. Part of this feels like a failure but I know that‚Äôs a silly way to look at this. Anyone else had their dosage go up recently? Mostly just looking for support
"Hi, all. I had my first ever PFT today (and didn't bring my inhaler because I was not instructed to do so üôÉ). Below, is the pulmonologist's interpretation. In layman's terms, what is hyperinflation, gas trapping, FRC, and residual volume? And what does this mean for my breathing?

""No evidence of obstructive lung disease noted on spirometry. Bronchodilator responsiveness was not evaluated. Normal mid expiratory flows present. Gas trapping present. Significant hyperinflation present. No evidence of restrictive lung disease. FRC and residual volume are significantly elevated. Diffusion capacity is normal, corrected for hemoglobin. Flow volume loops are acceptable for interpretation. Conclusions: No evidence of obstructive lung disease except for significant gas trapping and hyperinflation. Correlate clinically for asthma.""

Thanks!"
"Nebulizer is making my lips chapped and my nose dry. I know about the water soluble nasal moisturizer stuff, but what stuff is okay to put on my lips/the skin around my mouth? I use the nebulizer mask and I‚Äôm nervous to put products around the mask area because I use the nebulizer 4x a day and idk if lip products/moisturizer could do something bad. Should I be washing my face before I use the nebulizer? 
I‚Äôve never used a nebulizer and the instruction packet is kinda confusing. Possibly because the new meds are making me so jittery it‚Äôs hard to think. 
Should I be brushing my teeth before/after I use it? I think I‚Äôm over complicating things but idk."
" Hey gang so yeah question is in the title.

I have been diagnosed with asthma last week (61% PEV, 81% lung basically I am laying in bed right now and for the first time I can hear a sliiiiiiiiight wheezing while exhaling, almost not noticeable but it's there. 


Pulse oximeter shows 98/99 but yeah I feel like it's kind of hard to breathe and the doc didn't prescribe me an emergency med so I'm not sure if I should even use the relvar again. (I'm kinda scared too since I have a diagnosed panic disorder)

Thank you in advance for your help!"

"I wanted to ask if y'all had any advice for how to ascertain if your chest pain is coming from your asthma? Vs some other issue. My doc seems to think chest pain I've been experiencing is from my asthma (which was laying dormant for years until only quite recently!), but since I have several things that cause chest pain, like anxiety, acid reflux, etc, I wanted to ask if there was specific ""tells"" that tell you when it's asthma specifically induced pain."
"Struggling through a long flareup rn, trying to keep a better track of symptoms. 

Do normal, non-asthmatic people wheeze if they exhale forcefully enough? Or is any wheezing always a sign of asthma or other pulmonary process?"
"Im just wondering if symbicort is the usual long term medication for controlling asthma, how long have you guys been on it and any problems? Also what is your dosage for long term? 1 puff twice a day?"
"stupid question but i can‚Äôt find much about this on google and i‚Äôm newly diagnosed and it‚Äôs 4am so it‚Äôs not like i can speak to my doctor. should i use my reliever inhaler to get rid of a small wheeze? 

my asthma is triggered by allergies and at the moment it‚Äôs poorly controlled. every night when i lay down to go to sleep i start wheezing a little and occasionally get slightly tight chested. the wheeze isn‚Äôt much of a problem at all, it‚Äôs only when i breathe semi-deeply through my mouth and it‚Äôs not that loud but it‚Äôs a bit of a nuisance so usually i just use my reliever inhaler cos it gets rid of it. i‚Äôve already used my reliever inhaler 3 nights in a row for this now so i‚Äôm a bit hesitant to use it again as i don‚Äôt really wanna overdo it since i know it‚Äôs only meant for emergencies.

does a slight wheeze like this seem like a good enough reason to use it or should i just push through and ignore it?"
Do you need to clean the mouthpiece and medication bowl every single time you use it? I just started using the nebulizer and it says I need to clean everything except the tubing and the machine part with soap and water and then let them air dry every time I use it. I use it 4 times a day. Would it be a big deal if I only cleaned the medication bowl after use and then cleaned the mouthpiece at the end of the day?
"Who uses them? Are these even accurate? Anxiety is really bad sometimes and can't tell when  I need to go to er or if I'm ok

My asthma is generally well managed but come winter and it gets really bad. Just inhaling cold air when outside gets me. Any suggestions on what to do short of moving to a warmer place.
"I‚Äôve been able to control my asthma most of my adult life (outside the occasional flare-up or illness), but I moved into a new house in June and since we‚Äôve been using the heat, my asthma‚Äôs been non-stop. After being away for a day with my symptoms improved, I came back and got worse.

So I think it‚Äôs the house, and something about the heat but I‚Äôm not sure what. Renovated before moving in ‚Äî new HVAC unit, new filters. I have a humidifier and a big air filter. Taking meds and they‚Äôre not having their normal impact. I‚Äôm out of ideas and can‚Äôt breath. Does anyone have any recommendations?"

Not allowed to keep or take my nebulizer at work anymore- anyone have a good portable nebulizer recommendation? Preferably one from Amazon but if you have one that's worth it lmk! budget is 50-80 USD if possible.
"Hi everyone hope you're doing well:) 
I've recently been having some issues and one of my referrals was to a pulmonologist for what I thought was just a sleep study. She tested my breathing and sent me for blood work. The results saying I have high ige in the range of 1800. Next step is an immunologist. She also gave me the brio inhaler and I'm supposed to use it the next few weeks and then re test.  I'm just curious how it is connected to the ige when she's sending me to an immunologist for allergy testing. Plus if you use the brio have you had side effects? I searched the sub but only found a few posts. I'm extremely tired but can't tell if it is from that or the paxil I started taking 3 weeks ago. I'm also worried about it adding to my already high cortisol levels.  Any  input would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!"
Will your body adjust and it will go away eventually? I have gone to the lowest dose on Flovent 44mcg twice daily and still getting the rush feeling.
I don't know if it's tension from anxiety or if it just takes more effort to breath right now but my lower back is hurting and it's real annoying. My asthma is doing better nowadays but I still have these annoying symptoms like this.
"Hey guys, sorry if this is a stupid question. My husband got prescribed a short course of oral deflazacort for muscle inflammation. He's also on fostair. Do you guys take oral steroids with your regular inhalers normally? Is there any need for dose adjustment? I asked our doctor but it's a sunday and i'm not sure she'd respond. TIA!"
"I went away on vacation and didn‚Äôt have a single asthma issue at all. Seriously didn‚Äôt need my inhaler once. It was AMAZING! 

Since the moment I returned home, I‚Äôve been having horrible asthma issues. I literally can not go 2-3 hours without my inhaler, and honestly it‚Äôs not working well. I‚Äôve used my nebulizer once, and it also did not work. I‚Äôve tried coughing up mucus, but I don‚Äôt have much to cough up. 

I live with my dad and I suspect his cat got into my room while I was gone. I‚Äôm allergic, but had gotten acclimated to living with the cat. I was not having issues like this before my trip. I vacuumed and cleaned everything, but the asthma is still bad.

I just wanna feel some relief. I feel horrible. I was walking ten miles a day on vacation and now it hurts to just walk down the street and up the stairs. Should I just go to the hospital or the doctor at this point? I‚Äôve never had it where my medication provides little to no relief."
"Friday morning I met up with a new hiking group after being inactive for a long while. Well I saw my inhaler was expired so I said ""well how bad could it get? I'll be fine"". I was wrong, holy moly. I figured I would wake up Saturday morning and feel better, wrong again. I am coming up on 48 hours post hike and I am wheezing, coughing, and have excessive mucus. 

Should I go see a doctor at this point?
I already put in for a refill on my inhaler that's for sure."
i cannot go without singulair . i tried one day without it i already go into coughing fits . reason i was put on it cause advair alone was not helping me . im now in flovant fha and it really does work just as well !! however im really worried about singulair cause like i said i cant just use preventive inhalers and rescue inhalers alone or im gonna have non stop symptoms all the time . If singulair is not coverd is there another medication like singulair to replace it ??
"Do you remember how high your IgE level was?

When I was in the US, my pulmonologist wanted to put me on Xolair, but although Xolair is MEANT to treat asthma caused by high IgE, apparently my IgE was even higher than their accepted range (perhaps they had not studied the effects of Xolair on higher levels).

Well, I found out the only biologic in my country that's available is Xolair. Next month I'll be going down to a good hospital (6 hours away) to get yet another bunch of tests and I guess my IgE will be tested once again. It's already been tested before three times (my levels have always been above 3000).

Just wondering if anything has changed/more studies have been done, so that those with very high IgE levels still may have a chance of getting on Xolair. My asthma is totally out of control, and I really could use any extra help if it were available."
"Chemicals that activate CaSR in airway tissue and drive asthma symptoms like airway twitchiness, inflammation, and narrowing. Using calcilytics, nebulized directly into the lungs, we show that it is possible to deactivate CaSR and prevent all of these symptoms.

Basically CaSR is the cause of asthma, and this drug can deactivate it which will get rid of all asthma symptoms.

"For context, I recently had to go to ER because I had shortness of breath. They told me I likely had asthma and gave me an inhaler. I haven‚Äôt used an inhaler before then so I‚Äôm still pretty new on how everything works. The shortness of breath is slowly starting to flare up again, and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt use it correctly and didn‚Äôt get enough or if I should just wait for the 4 hours to pass by. (It would be around 1:30 am if I did as I tried it at the hospital a little bit before 9:30pm) I wasn‚Äôt able to get much sleep yesterday because I felt sick so I‚Äôm a bit worried about staying up late again."
"I‚Äôm a 27 year old female. Overall my asthma is well managed with the help of Montelukast. I am typically very active and lift weights and walk 5-6x/a week. I came down with a virus that I let go too long before seeking help and was diagnosed with pneumonia. Antibiotics and a steroid helped, however I am really struggling with recovery. I had no idea how long it can take to recover from pneumonia. I am on week 4 of being sick (2 weeks out from pneumonia diagnosis) and I have just finally progressed to the point that I can get out of bed to do small tasks for 3-4 hours straight (before I could only be up for an hour at a time before becoming exhausted). I still rely heavily on my nebulizer/inhaler. I still have phlegm, I don‚Äôt feel like I can take a full breath, and I get winded very easily. My recovery has not been linear and has thus been really frustrating. How have you guys coped with pneumonia? I just want my life back. Not being able to go to the gym or be my normal active self has really taken a toll on my mental health. I have been doing all the things my doctor has recommended (taking an expectorant, prescription cough medicine, humidifier, lots of fluids and rest). I try to remind myself that this is temporary but sometimes I feel like I will never get better."
"I‚Äôm one of the lucky asthmatics to have non type 2 asthma with high neutrophils. I‚Äôve been on countless medications with none of them doing anything to help fix the problem. My quality of life is terrible, I can‚Äôt walk up stairs without getting out of breath and I‚Äôm growing frustrated. I‚Äôm on my 4th flare up of the year and my 3rd time this year being on prednisone for more than 3 weeks. Each flare up just seems to make my asthma and quality of life worse. 

I‚Äôm currently on Arnuity, Incruse, and Brovana. I‚Äôm curious if anyone has had any success with any medication when it comes to non type 2. I‚Äôm not eligible for any biologics and it seems like the next course of action is a daily prednisone or antibiotic. My doctors are hoping a new drug comes to the market, but other than that there‚Äôs not many options."
"I have asthma since I was a baby and I have suffered like 6 pneumonias during my life (24F). The last two weeks I have been sleeping in an apartment that was getting the walls painted and ·ªä have  been cleaning trogough all of my stuff which has involved a lot of dust. My breathing has only gotten worse since we started and I have taken back my   inhalers for the past 3 days. 

 I haven't  had severe asthma attacks but I definetly feel I don't bread as usually. My particular sensation is like I can feel the dust particles in my throat (I don't feel it in the lungs, not yet tho, as I have in other occasions). 

I'm wondering if any of you feel specially sad when your asthma gets worse, as a consequence. In my case when I have the symptoms described above for some days in a row I start to feel really bad emotionally, as I feel very vulnerable and weak, and I wonder why my lungs cannot function as they are supposed to. Also I am scared that it gets worse,but at the same time I struggle to go to the doctor's to check up on me because I feel it's not too bad (just yet). ps, I live in a country where healthcare is public so we can go pretty much whenever we need it without worrying about the economic cost."

"Iv had asthma since I was little when I got pneumonia but recently well at Christmas I had a asthma attack that built up over 5 days took a breath and it was short on Christmas day it lasted for 5 days and then had an attack nearly went hospital but then it stopped but after that I worried about it all the time I felt I had to take deep breaths all the time yeah maybe a month or 2 after it my lungs were probably healing so I could've still had short breath but when summer hit or around after April it just went and I didn't notice it I was fine then in August my anxiety hit an all time high I was about to go in a psychiatrist ward till i said I was OK although I wernt and explained I was good to be at home and since August my anxiety and ocd is high but along with this it seems every day I get anxious I get out of breath till I take my mind of it 

I had panic attacks apparently felt it was misdiagnosed as they said it was that after my asthma attack but I think my anxiety triggers my asthma for a short time 5 minutes to 1hr at the most 

Does anxiety trigger asthma and could someone explain how?

Thanks In advance"
"I‚Äôm pretty good about rinsing my mouth out so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs thrush. Was doing my morning dulera dose and it felt like I was inhaling glass. Throat and chest hurt so bad! I‚Äôm also having trouble swallowing after. I keep my asthma meds in a specific case so I don‚Äôt think I accidentally inhaled something weird.

"Hi all,

I have been taking symbicort the 160 version 2 puffs in morning and 2 at night. My doctor perscribed it for me for 1 month to see how I respond, I am nearing the end in a few days and have a few concerns which I will bring up to the doctor but just wanted to see.

When I first started taking it, it was really good and helped a lot, day 10, my asthma got worse for a day randomly although no change in timing of symbicort, around day 24-25, my asthma has gotten worse randomly althought my timing was a bit off due to exam stress and me being careless as well but also much more stress during this time. Could my asthma coming back be because of this? Even taking 2 puffs now is not helping as much so I am just worried.

Also, I did not think symbicort was associated with palpitations but I have noticed since I started taking it that I get palpitations at night, not that worrisome but lasts for 5 minutes and is annoying to get to sleep, however, I dont get them during the day or exercise or anything, does taking symbicort way before bed fix this? Cause I usually take it pretty close to when I sleep and I have noticied that at times when I dont take it super close to bed then it does not happen. 

Thank you all!"

"Had a mild asthma attack but I didn't have an inhaler for an hour so it progressed and eventually I was really out of breath. It makes sense that my chest muscles are exhausted and sore, but it's insanely painful in my chest when I breathe in deeply. 

Its so painful in my throat, and I have constant pain in my chest and throat especially when/after I swallow.

 It's been years and years since my last asthma attack and I'm just stunned at the pain and tightness.... Using Icyhot and taking ibuprofen, drinking tea, they all help a little but I can't sleep. Anyone else experienced this? Any tips? Is this normal?"

I went on a run this morning and it was around 40 degrees F. Tonight I started having a dry cough and a tight chest and it hurt to breathe. I also had an irritated throat all day. Did the cold air cause this?
"I thought I outgrew asthma. No asthma attacks in 5 years. 
I‚Äôd been experiencing shortness of breath and dizziness for about a month leading up to the asthma attack, but I didn‚Äôt make the connection. Then I had one so bad I had to go to the ER. I got a shot of corticosteroid and now I use an albuterol inhaler twice a day. It‚Äôs been 10 days and I still don‚Äôt feel very good, I tried to contact my doctor today but they‚Äôre closed. 
When I breathe in through my mouth there‚Äôs a honking wheeze. It goes away a few minutes after I take my inhaler but comes back. I have chest pain/tightness and random stabbing chest pain and I feel tired/weak. 
The inhaler was actually working pretty well until yesterday and now I‚Äôm weak and wheezing again. 


I‚Äôm going to go back to the doctor as soon as I can, but until then I was wondering if it‚Äôs best for me to rest as much as possible or if I should be trying to do a little walking around."

I was desperately trying to cough in order to get my mucus out and get my breathing back to normal. The coughs are very deep and I cough like a very old guy.

"I'm from India and I've been taking Duolin (Levosalbutamol and Ipratoprium) since childhood and nothing else. Recently spoke to an asthma doc who recommended I take Symbicort Turbuhaler (and Levoceterizine). Recommended I take it (Symbicort) thrice a day for the first week, and then twice a day.

Thing is, I took it 5 hour back and I haven't had total relief. Yes, it's definitely a little better, but I have this itch to reach for my Duolin constantly. Like a heavy heavyness on my chest that just isn't going away. Anyone else feel the same way? Or have any advice? TIA"
"I hate them and they are so gross! 

My parents always had a fake Christmas tree because the real ones just left me grumpy and miserable on and around Christmas. I started living with my boyfriend and I feel bad because he thinks fake Christmas trees are depressing. We got a dog this year and I'm finally getting okay with that as long as he doesn't go in the bedroom, but I don't think a real Christmas tree and a dog in the house will be great for me. 

I don't want to completely mess up Christmas for him either. I'm willing to try to meet him in the middle because I think I love him. He even stopped smoking weed so I wouldn't smell it on this clothes which is really sweet. So do you have any Christmas tree ideas that would make both of us happy?"
"Hey guys, I just want to know if this seems normal and how long you think I'll be dealing with this flare.

**Two days ago, I went to the ER because my peak flow was dropping into the lower yellow zone and my nebulizer wasn't helping. I had some sort of sinus infection that had moved to my chest, and it quickly became an issue.**

A duo-neb, some albuterol, and a prescription for 50mg of prednisone for the next 5 days cleared me up enough for them to send me home.

Since then, I have seen progress. I'll summarize it.

**Before ER**: Peak flow was 270 and dropping (230 hits red). Nebulizer was not working at all. 20mg of prednisone made zero difference.

**After ER**: 30g more of prednisone, a duo-neb, and an abuterol neb sent my peak flow to around 340. Once I returned home (with a stronger prednisone prescription), my peak flow would hit 350 after a nebulizer and some coughing. It would then slowly drop to around 310 as my next neb time approached. Sleeping caused my peak flow to drop and it was somewhat difficult to bring it back up at times (lots of coughing). Mucus was thick and green. Trips to the bathroom were as much as I could do without it making my numbers drop.

I was also still having symptoms of my illness such as a stuffy nose, ear drainage, and a sore throat.

**Day 2**: Peak flow ranged from 310-350. Coughing up mucus would raise it. No distinct relationship to nebulizer time other than I would sometimes hit green zone after one now (360-370). Hit 380 before bed. I was able to get up the stairs, shower, and cook without it negatively impacting my breathing. Mucus was water with small particles of green/yellow mucus mixed in. Sleep still caused my peak flow to drop and symptoms to worsen. It was less difficult to recover from, but still uncomfortable and scary. I actually felt like I could breathe well during waking hours at times, however.

No sign of other sinus infection symptoms other than an occasional need to blow my nose.

**Day 3**: Where I am now. I woke up early with a peak flow of 300 after sleeping hard for the first time since coming back home. I coughed up some mucus and it's sitting at 320. I do feel better at 320 than I did a few days ago, but I don't like the number. I know I could raise it more if I sat there coughing, but I'm about to use my nebulizer anyway.

No signs of the infection that caused this so far.

**Question: Does it appear that I am recovering? If so, how long will I be like this for (by your experience)? Is it normal to feel better but still have a lower peak flow for a bit after a flare like this?**

I fear that I may not recover in time to return to work next Wednesday or that I will get worse after I finish my prednisone. My doctor cannot see me until the week after next and his NP is not that great with asthma. If I do not feel better, my options are suck it up and switch to a new doctor or hope Urgent Care can help me.

I had a flare like this a few years ago, but I did not have a peak flow meter to track anything. Otherwise, I haven't had this happen since I was a small child. Usually prednisone fixes anything that happens right up."

"I had the visor covid vaccine a few days ago I was fine I had a really sore arm that's gone almost now but one of my asthma triggers is dust and it only happens when I move something with dust behind it or on it 

Yesterday I was moving something and the usual happend I got a runny nose felt slightly short of breath and tired I took my inhalers and that was it iv woke up now and I still have all of my allergy symptoms

Does anyone know if the covid vaccine reacts with allergys or asthma

Thanks in advance"
"My asthma sucks and my allergies are horrible. Had a scratch test done and I was allergic to everything expect dogs. I mean everything that involves indoor and outdoor stuff. anytime the temperature changes I get sick, sinus headache congestion struggle breathing sore throat and so on. About a week and a half ago it went from 27 degrees to 75 degrees back down to 30.  I got sick like I always do. I thought it was no biggie I‚Äôve been dealing with this my whole life and just went to work. I work by myself and not near others unless someone is helping me pick something up. We are extremely short staffed so I couldn‚Äôt call in. I ended up working 9 days straight and would get off eat and go straight to sleep. I noticed I couldn‚Äôt smell or taste anything in the mornings. But that‚Äôs common side effect I‚Äôve been dealing with due to my allergies. I figured If it was covid I would know because of how bad my asthma is. I decided to get tested before thanksgiving just to be safe‚Ä¶ turns out I have covid. The vaccination works. I know healthy people that have been put on ventilators. This post was long and drawn out but with having asthma I‚Äôve feared covid. All my symptoms are gone and I feel like I do everyday. I hope this gives people with asthma hope and less fear."

"So I was in and out of hospital 9 times and God knows how many times in A&amp;E with my asthma this year.

Yesterday had a bad attack (not super bad though, just couldn't control it on my own with my own nebulisers) and had to go to A&amp;E. Bit bothered by it to be honest. Hope that it doesn't look bad for my Xolair to continue. 

Do think my medications are helping overall though, the period of stability has been wonderful and hopefully it'll continue! Just need to figure out what went wrong. 

Hope you're all well!"
"Alright folks , I've been battling asthma my whole life and have been on QVAR and Ventolin in case of emergency. For some reason the doc says he can't get me QVAR anymore due to discontinuation of the Medicine and gave me biztri aerosphere i think it's called, by astra zeneca. 

I'm asking a ""tin foil hat ""question because I've always been conscious about taking medication and I'm seeing that the side effects of this medicine look pretty rough. Anyone taking it or know if those common side effects are actually common? 

I also think it's just the generic version of symbicort, but I'm not sure."

"I had an asthma attack at 9am today and went to A&amp;E and was treated with steroids and nebulisers. I was discharged at about 2pm as the doctor felt my breathing rate had come down enough for me to go home.

I'm still breathing quite fast as if I've just done mild exercise like climbing the stairs. Getting up to do anything like get a drink or go to the toilet makes me feel quite out of breath as if I've done moderate exercise like a short sprint.

I'm meant to be back at work tomorrow but I don't think I'll be able to go if I'm still this bad. When do you usually start getting better?"
"I feel like everyone is getting sick and ofc I finally caught it.

Some time passed then I then tried taking mucinex + benedryl before bed and woke up in the middle of the night with itchier hives, and swollen ears and throat on top of my nasty cold. I‚Äôm relying on my nebulizer for relief and I feel like I can‚Äôt win üò≠ nothing like feeling like crap from a cold + asthma flaring up + allergic reaction to put the cherry on top.

"They did a Covid swab on me at the Pulmonologist on Tuesday.  There was talk of admitting me.  I refused.  My O2 sats were super low and I was coughing and wheezing.  Chest xray was cloudy in the left lung.  I really felt like I might die, but I didn't want to be a ventilator hog.  


If it were flu, I wouldn't be any better and the asthma would be worse now.   My neighbor's sister died last week of Covid and my  neighbor in her distraught condition didn't tell us she had exposed us.  I don't know if she's even realized it yet.    


Yesterday I started feeling better by the hour.  I went two hours without a cough, and when I cough, it isn't nearly so painful.  Headache is still there.  Joints are still achey but the weather got colder.  Senses of taste/smell are definitely subdued but not gone.  Cognition is very fuzzy relative to how I normally feel.    


The only explanation is that I had two Pfizer shots more than six months ago.   I cannot imagine getting past a respiratory virus and fluid in my left lung THIS quickly.  It's also astonishing to me that my right lung looked clear.  I am on Humira so I was sure things were going to get worse not better!  


My asthma meds were ramped up, my prednisone doubled to 20 mg for awhile, and I got antibiotics--and forgot to start them.  I don't think there is any point in taking them.  


Some kind soul wrote a great post to me about ways of dealing with an asthma attack, and I can't find the post, on someone else's severe asthma topic.  He/she asked for information about my asthma treatments and I wanted to answer after I got some sleep.  I don't Reddit well and my eyesight is damaged."
"I had this for the first time recently and it was super scary!

I was in the ED and all was looking managed, set to go home within the hour but I suddenly got nauseous, dizzy, hot and flushed, then my hand started uncontrollably moving/seizing and my body soon followed. I couldn't control a single muscle and they were all tensed and moving. 

Has anyone else had this? I'm hoping to never have to go through that ever again!"
i‚Äôm fucking wheezing and coughing every damn day. i use my friends inhaler and it goes away for a few hours but then comes right back. i have no previous history of breathing problems but i am a heavy weed smoker of about 2 years. it‚Äôs obviously the weed causing my issues but i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just because i need to give my lungs a break or because i have a serious lung issue. i‚Äôve been cutting back and working out.
"My asthma was dormant for so long I believed it went away. Until last year when I contracted covid and all my symptoms, triggers, flare-ups became 10x worse than they ever were before. I have to nebulize every 4 hours every day. I've been to the ER twice in one month. I use my rescue inhaler 3 times a day. I ordered a portable handheld nebulizer to cut down on inhaler usage. My nighttime asthma flares up every night. So much so to the point, I haven't had a consistent night's rest going on 3 months now. Chest pain every other day from walking too much or too far. From lifting things I use to be able to lift but now I can not. I have to go on disability because of how severe it became and with my other pre-existing medical conditions this was the icing on the cake that made it to where I can't work anymore. 

I feel fatigued every day. Emotionally and physically exhausted. Sometimes, I can't manage full-on sentences without needing to take a break or I use phrases and words instead to conserve my breath   It's mindboggling how you can go from went from, knowing what you wanted to do in life, In school, pursuing your dreams and goals. Taking walks everyday, and being physically active, having a social life, going out with friends, and enjoying time together, to being unable to manage to do most of those things. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel ashamed and guilty for filing for disability and having to be on it. I feel like this wasn't the way it was supposed to be. I loved working and going to school because I was following my passion and dreams. Working gave me a sense of responsibility and pride for providing for my friends and family. I took pride in being a dependable and reliable person. I've been holding this in for months and needed somewhere or someone to vent to. For those who took the time to make it this far and read, thank you for your time and reading my post."
Why does it feel like my asthma is worse right after eating? Tightness gets worse and have to continually clear my throat and it's hoarse and dry

"Beclametasone 100mcg\*

Breo 92/22mcg\*

I was on Qvar (Beclometasone\*) before and my asthma was still poorly controlled and so I was put on to Breo last week. 

I've been taking Breo\* for around 6 days now, I take it around 9pm, do the usual rinse gargle and brush my teeth.

I don't know if it's making a difference. With Qvar I would wake up with wheezing and it seems to be better now but not fully gone. I also feel like I'm I'm using my rescue inhaler quite a bit during the day. 

Apologies for all the fluff, my question was: how long does breo take to fully work, and does this increase in rescue inhaler use come from the fact I had stopped my Qvar and may still be building up Breo('s effectiveness) in my body?"
"Hi, everyone!

We are a group of students at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden and we are currently taking a course in building startup companies.

We are looking for athletes with asthma to interview (in chat works fine) for a school project. With ""athlete"" we mean someone who spends a lot of time in some physical sport. It does not need to be in a professional capacity.

Please send us a DM if you are willing to participate. It will not take a long time to do.

"Was wondering because I know sometimes a surgery can be approved if necessary.

I feel like the answer is a big hell no but wanted to check with you guys in case anyone has experience with it"
"I've been sick for about 4 days with a mystery illness. No fever or anything. Typical sinus infection symptoms until today.

I went to the ER this morning after my peak flow dropped to mid-low yellow and continued dropping after taking maintenance medication, rescue medication, and prednisone. They gave me a duoneb and another albuterol treatment plus an additional 30mg of prednisone before letting me go. The air was moving well in my lungs, but my o2 sat was slightly concerning them as it the highest it got before I left was 97. It stayed around 95 most of the time. They said to come back if the nebulizer stopped working again.

I'm supposed to stay on nebulizers and 50mg of prednisone for the next few days. I'm also supposed to follow up with my primary care physician, but he isn't available for two weeks (debating switching because having to wait to see him is not something I can do all the time).

My peak flow is now steady at upper yellow/occasionally hitting lower green. However, my o2 sat keeps ranging wildly from 92-97, with it often lingering around 94. I do feel a lot better than I did earlier, but ironically my o2 sat was higher then (96-97 steady). My treatments are lasting the full four hours without my peak flow dropping more than a notch or so. I am unsure what the hell is going on.

When my significant other gets home in a bit, I'll test the pulse ox on her. Hopefully the cheap little machine is just not working right. If not, I may be taking another trip to the ER.

Has this ever happened to anybody else? I'm scared it's something other than asthma, as I know usually asthmatics will not see a o2 sat drop until they are in a severe attack. I don't feel anything other than typical tightness I get when I'm sick. I feel way better than I did this morning, yet my ox is telling me otherwise.

What are y'all experiences with low o2 sat with good peak flow/minor symptoms and your experiences with pharmacy brand pulse ox's?"
"Hey guys

Been trying Albuterol and budesonide for a while. Seems to help a little but not enough. I'm wondering should I try a different type of inhaler ? Like
Beta-agonists(i think this is abuterol), anticholinergics, and theophylline
One of those above? I just need a different route to talk to my doctor about and wanted some suggestions. Any other ideas that I'm not considering? Thanks!"

"I've been diagnosed with asthma since I was a baby but I had learned to control my breathing and hadn't had an attack until two years ago to last year, but only because I was sick. Recently I moved for college to a completely different environment, now I live in a a city (kinda) compared to my hometown which is a desert. I only get asthma, usually, when I'm sick, but lately, either during work or just in my room, I would suddenly have the urge to cough and then my throat would feel like closing up and my eyes would tear up and when I use my inhaler, I feel a lot better. Does this have to do with allergies or is my asthma just getting worse?"
"Hi, everyone!

My name is David and I am a student at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. I am taking a course where we learn how to build a startup company. You might get a hint of what our school project is related to from me posting here but I am just here to learn a bit more about the market.

We are starting our project by focusing on athletes with asthma and hopefully there are a few of you here. By ""athlete"" we mean someone who spends quite a lot of time in any physical sport. It does not need to be in a professional capacity.

We would appreciate it a lot of you took a few minutes out of your day to answer the following questions:

1. When and how was your last symptomatic experience?
2. How often do you experience symptoms?
3. Are you actively doing something to mitigate your symptoms?
   1. Do you log your symptoms? If so, how often?
4. Have your symptoms limited your performance or daily life?
5. Do you know which factors that usually cause your symptoms?
6. If you know you will have asthma symptoms on a given day, does that change your behavior? 
7. Are you able to tell beforehand when you will get symptoms?
   1. If so, how accurately do you predict the severity of your symptoms?
   2. What do you do if you think you will get symptoms soon?

Lastly, would you consider logging your experiences with asthma to help us out (no obligation whatsoever)?

Thank you in advance for helping us with our school project!"
"Hi, I‚Äôm 21 years old and I suffer from asthma and high blood pressure. The past couple months I‚Äôve been having trouble breathing and tightness of the chest, pain in my sides, and bad dizziness. I‚Äôve been to the hospital 6 times this month over the fear that I‚Äôm in serious danger. They‚Äôve given me prednisone for the asthma flare ups I think about a month ago, and my doctor put me on Flovent HFA along with my Albuterol which I‚Äôve had all my life. The thing is I also have high blood pressure usually 147/77 when I was at the hospital the other day my bp read 161/77 the doctor there said it wasn‚Äôt lethally high and that it was probably that high because of white coat syndrome.  I‚Äôve been struggling and feeling like I can‚Äôt pull in enough air every time I breath and I‚Äôm very lightheaded. I‚Äôm tired of going to the hospital I know they know my face by heart there what do you guys think it is? I could really use some help. Thank you 

I‚Äôm also diagnosed with Generalized anxiety disorder. 

I don‚Äôt take medication for my blood pressure anymore because my doctor and I discussed trying to correct it with lifestyle changes given I‚Äôm only 21"

"I‚Äôm seeing a therapist to try to deal with some PTSD from a life threatening attack involving weeks in the hospital this summer. I brought up being upset that my kid has inherited asthma. We don‚Äôt know if he got it from me or Spouse, but he has it.

She told me to look for the blessings and try to find the positive in Kiddo having asthma, because apparently acknowledging that it ducking sucks and moving on isn‚Äôt acceptable and I shouldn‚Äôt need to process any guilt for giving it to him, or navigate any tricky ‚ÄúMommy almost died from this thing you have but you probably won‚Äôt‚Äù parenting waters. The only thing I can think of is that he‚Äôs less likely to die if poison gas spewing aliens invade Earth (note: do not watch Signs when you‚Äôre home with an asthma flare. Just don‚Äôt.) So I‚Äôm asking, because I honestly believe there is no positive to find here, how has having asthma blessed you?"
"Hi there,

I was diagnosed with asthma april this year. I love to row and today I was doing an erg workout (ergs are rowing machines). I took my inhaler before the workout because that's what my doc told me to do. Afterwards, I noticed that when I bend over, breathe in any way that is not super lightly or laugh, I end up in a coughing fit. My throat also feels like when you don't drink water so your throat dries out a ton during exercise. I've taken my inhaler 4 times since 5 pm (Nurse approved). Can I prevent this in future? Is there something else I should do afterwards?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance."

Idk what‚Äôs going on but I go to two gyms and this one specific one I‚Äôve noticed I have a lot harder of a time breathing in and I sweat a LOT. Has anyone ever noticed anything like this? Am I losing my mind? Thank you!
"Hello, I just got prescribed Breo Ellipta for my severe asthma, my insurance wouldnt cover and the closest generic was Wixela Inhub 250 -- I was happy there was a generic that cost less but now I am reading online many people dislike this medication. To those that have taken or know about the drug, does it work for you? What stories have you heard. Not to be tin foil hat but what are the odds insurance companies making fake reviews so we pay for the brand name?"
"Hey guys, so really need to clear out stuff from my closet and get my winter cloths...i havent cleaned it in like 3 years. i had attacks around the last cleaning time, im allergic to dust mites and from what i know closets with books and untouched closth like mine are their favourite homes. i've been thininking about hiring someone to clean it out but im still worried about getting the dust mites airborn in my room.

am i exaggerating with my worring about this? or am i rightly cautious?"
"Why is it you take the highest reading? Why wouldn't you take your worst?? Sometimes my three readings are so different. Like for instance first it was 460, then 400 then 470??

400 for me is yellow zone"

I got switched from Alvesco to Wixela and I‚Äôve seen it has crazy side effects. So does it actually work? Is it worth the side effects? Or should I ask to get switched to something else? (Got switched because my asthma has been on a steady decline for the past 3 years with medicine)
"basically im having the worst cold of my life. it made my asthma act up a ton so i took albuterol via my nebulizer like an hour ago. would it be safe for me to take nyquil? i have a sore throat and it hurts like a bitch for me to even swallow my own saliva not to mention nose congestion. i'm just trying to get rid of my cold without dying 

tl;dr: is it safe for me to tsle nyquil after takinh albuterol via nebulizer?"
"Hi all, I am looking at air purifiers for a home, and the consensus on the subreddit is that they help with asthma. My question is, do any of you use a monitoring solution to check for dust/dander in the air, or do you just keep the purifier on all the time? Am considering how much importance to give to a model that offers additional air quality sensing as a feature."
"Okay so I was recently diagnosed with asthma (I‚Äôve been relatively over weight my whole life and it turns out I wasn‚Äôt just fat I‚Äôve had asthma my whole life) and I started using an inhaler when I exercise and when my asthma is really triggered by an allergen. I noticed that I get out of breath and wheeze way easier than I use to. I might just be more aware of my breathing and how I feel, but any experiences with this??? Also, if anyone has any resource to really make your apartment asthma friendly I‚Äôd appreciate it (it‚Äôs kinda hard to make big changes like no carpet when you rent :/)"

I literally hate having asthma. I have a pretty sensitive gag reflex so when i start coughing i usually have enough time to start my nebulizer and it'll be fine. But every once in a while i dont start in time and ill end up up-chucking everywhere. It sucks because theres nothing i can do except wipe my face off and keep doing my treatment bc i cant breathe and i end up having to do a lot of cleaning. I started leaving a bucket near my bed but if i forget to put it back after cleaning i literally dont have sheets for the night. I even bought a mattress protector when i got a new mattress bc i was tired of having to try and clean my mattress whenever this happened. Does this happen to anyone else?
"Hello,

Just wondering say you have lots of chest congestion and can't get it up and out does your body rid of it some other way or does it stay there forever since you don't cough it out??"
"One of my inhalers is breath-activated, so the medicine cartridge is built into it and cannot be removed for cleaning. I tried to wash it last night, but despite my best efforts, enough water dribbled up inside that when I tried to use it, it wouldn't dispense medication. Is there a way to clean this type of inhaler without ruining it?"
"My three year old has been given inhalers for suspectedasthma (pretty sure she has it because I do) that have been working really well for her. 
We ripped the carpets out and replaced the gas hob and cooker with electric. Bricked up two fire places. We keep on top of the dust making sure to vacuum when she's at nursery so it's not in the air. Don't use anything fragranced or any aerosol ect. Anything that has an impact on the air quality in our house we try and control. 
Now the temperature has dropped (UK) one of our neighbours has started burning wood (I guess he has a log burner) and we can smell it even if the windows and doors are shut is still gets in and I think it's triggering my daughter asthma. Yesterday it smelled really synthetic as if they were burning chemicals or something synthetic I'm not sure. Anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to clean the air in our house? Would this even work? I've seen air filters but not looked too much into it. I don't think he's going to stop using his log burner because my daughter a few doors away has a cough. Her cough has been much worse since we started smelling the burning. It's so frustrating to have done so much to control this and have the whole house smell like smoke anyway :("
"Started feeling like I had a cold or flu Saturday night, went to Urgent Care yesterday afternoon. They were pretty busy. The intake/triage nurse was pretty nice. He swabbed me for a rapid COVID test right away. The nurse practitioner who came in to give me my results and a quick exam was not so nice. She wasn‚Äôt mean, but she had ZERO bedside manner. I‚Äôm not saying I need to be coddled, but a little sympathy and gentleness would be nice when you‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm COVID positive even after full vaccination and living like a hermit‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs experiencing a lot of work fatigue right now, especially with COVID cases (on the rise again in my area) which would definitely make it harder to be gentle about it but she made no efforts to reassure me much less tell me what to watch for/when I might need to go to the ER or something.

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm one of the fucking anti-vaxxers who got us into this mess‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been taking ALL the precautions. The only thing I haven‚Äôt done is get my booster shot because I was waiting for a weekend when I had no responsibilities so I could rest for a few days after getting jabbed.

I guess I‚Äôm lucky since I have a pulse ox device to keep an eye on that, I have an at-home nebulizer and a full box of albuterol vials, I have an extra albuterol inhaler, and I‚Äôm close to a 24-hour Walgreens pharmacy, but still. I‚Äôm high risk for severe complications for a number of reasons and it would have been nice if she‚Äôd acknowledged that and tried to allay my fears even for just two minutes."
"I've had asthma for as long as I could remember, but I've never had an attack that landed me in the emergency room. I've been doing really good for the past 5 or so years and have lost track of ALL of my asthma supplies so I had nothing with me. On Friday night my chest felt a little tight and I have a bad cough, but I was able to get to sleep and stay asleep. By Saturday afternoon I was having more trouble breathing and was coughing almost non stop and knew I needed to get a breathing treatment. I called around to different urgent cares to see if any could do it but unfortunately because of covid NONE are doing those right now, but I did find someone willing to see me and she ended up giving me 7 different prescriptions for an asthma flare up. Come to find out, my insurance won't cover ANY rescue/corticosteroid inhalers unless the patient is under 12 years old. (apparently adults don't have asthma, right?) At that point it was 8pm and I was starting to panic and was having an even harder time breathing, I knew my only option was to go to the ER. I was there from 9pm-2am and they gave me two breathing treatments and started me on oral Prednisone, the doctor wrote me a prescription for Albuterol and wrote it in a way that got my insurance to cover it, I was still feeling pretty awful but I thought I would be okay. Once I leave, I go to a 24 hour pharmacy in my area to fill it and that took about an hour. I soon start feeling even worse with extreme right sided chest pain so I pulled over and called the doctor who treated me in the er, when he heard that I had chest pain he told me to come back in. I show back up at the er around 4am and things started moving a lot quicker, they could tell I wasn't doing so good and started running a lot more tests. In the end it was just a bad asthma attack that required multiple nebulizers and oral + IV Prednisone. Its now the next day and I'm still feeling pretty damn awful, I'm at the point where I'm throwing up from coughing so hard. I'm going to make an urgent follow up with my primary doctor as soon as they open to hopefully get the process going of at home nebulizer treatments. Not being able to breathe really fucking sucks."
"Has anyone got a recommendation for indoor-air quality monitoring? I am looking for a air quality monitor that I can trigger my air-purifiers to work at specific ppm levels.

"I have a bit of a phlegm issue in the morning and evening (before I go to bed). I can feel gurgling/bubbling in my back when I laugh, cough and breathe deeply. I sometimes wheeze on inhale and exhale, and sometimes the sound is deep, like snoring. I cough up lots of phlegm in the morning. This has been going on for weeks, and I haven‚Äôt had an infection. I have recently changed my preventer, from ICS+LABA, to ICS only. My PEF has been down 20% since then, so there is definitely something going on in my lungs.

"Just found a pack of expired Beclazone inhalers in my room that all expired 3 years ago.

I did some Google and can't find an answer to what will happen if I use an expired Beclazone, but I did find a [blog](https://www.singlecare.com/blog/expired-inhaler/) saying (generally) ""Inhalers are probably safe after the expiration date, which is usually one year after it was issued but is likely to be less effective"".

So, is that true? Are there any differences between different types of inhalers in terms of the effect of expiration that will cause?"
"Hi all,

I've been coughing for more than a month now. One doctor told me it's my cough variant asthma since I've had a cough every other year immediately after a cold that would last several months.

This time, I took prednisone (on my second course) and it doesn't seem to be getting better unlike last time.

I have a very dry cough, no mucus, GERD symptoms a few months ago that led to an upper endoscopy, and seasonal allergies.

I was also referred to an allergy/immunology specialist and Otolaryngologist for further diagnosis. What should my next steps be? I have yet to get a chest or neck x-ray. Should I make a request to my doctors first?

"I (27f) just got back from my first boxing class in about a month. I used to work out almost everyday twice a day before school started but since school started I haven‚Äôt been able to work out nearly as much as I have 2 other jobs as well. I have weight to lose but I‚Äôm in decent shape as far as cardio goes. For the past year now I‚Äôve noticed a mild tightness in my chest when I run. Most times I push through anyway since it‚Äôs not severe enough to stop. There was one time several months ago where i went for a run around my neighborhood and by the time I got back home, it felt like there was a tickle in my throat and I coughed and coughed along with my chest being tight. At the time I figured I was allergic to something I possibly inhaled on my run and didn‚Äôt think much of it until now. I finally was able to get to my first boxing class this morning after a long time of missing out due to school/work. We began our warm up and I felt my energy drop a bit despite being so excited to finally be there. During the warm up my chest became super tight but I finished anyway. By the time we were about to start our first round, I was in the bathroom hacking up my lungs. The tickle in my throat was so severe and my chest was so tight unlike anything I‚Äôve ever felt. I coughed so much it felt like I was going to throw up. There was so much mucus in the back of my throat! I had to leave the class after about 10 mins of this. I have NO history of asthma or breathing problems but is it possible to suddenly develop it? Is that what I‚Äôm experiencing?"

"Been struggling lately with asthma but it's an issue I haven't had before this year. 

Instead of not feeling like I'm getting enough air in, I feel like I've got stale air I can't get out. 

Feels like I'm only using half of my capacity but instead of going empty to half full I go half full to full and when I breathe out I'm only half out. My chest feels constantly inflated or strained like I'm holding my breath but I'm not.

Anyone ever dealt with this?"
"I saw that aerochamber made the compact 2 go spacer and I can't get it in the UK. I'm not great at taking my inhalers without spacers and I find I get more benefit from them and less likely to get oral thrush from the steroid ones if there's a spacer.

Of course though it would be nice to be able to take my inhaler in public without assembling a Fisher Price clarinet first, the compact version looks pretty ideal for me but I can't get it anywhere here, I can't even order it for international shipping that I can see.

Can anyone help a wheezy woman in England out? Winter is rolling in and I'm already using my relief inhaler a bit more as it gets harsh outside, all I want for christmas is a less ridiculous spacer."


"I posted 2 days ago regarding my son having cough variant asthma.

Today morning, I noticed that right after I gave him Fluticasone inhaler (Flohale, steroid inhaler), he started coughing continuously for an hour, non-stop. It went down a bit after few hours (He was still coughing but not as much). Later this night, I gave him Flohale once again, and it triggered the intense continuous coughs. He started to cough non-stop for an hour.   
It's his 5th day of taking Flohale, it only seems to be making his cough extremely worse.   
I don't want to give it to him anymore, but I have also heard that stopping a steroid inhaler midway can cause problems too. What do i do? Is he allergic to Fluticasone inhaler? I'll be consulting the doctor tomorrow morning."

"Howdy, I was recently diagnosed with asthma about 2 months ago and I have been on the 200mg dose of Breo Ellipta. I have been on it for close to two months now. I‚Äôve noticed the last few weeks I am constantly exhausted no matter how much sleep I get. It‚Äôs also making me a bit moody which steroids usually do to me. I wake up with a tight chest and constantly have a high heart rate.. is this a sign that maybe the inhaler is not working for me? Or could this be symptoms of the inhaler? I‚Äôm new to asthma so not sure all the asthma symptoms yet. I just feel like total crap and tired all the time."
"How long can they last? I had covid in on 28 days post and the pulm thinks I might be having asthma exacerbation. I'm on day 6 of 7 days of 50 mg pred and I have albuterol inhaler of needed and albuterol nebulizer if needed.  I'm worried because I'm not yet better and I'm almost done with the steroids. 

I'm new to the asthma world and i just don't know when I should seek help. I feel just mildly congested in my chest 24/7 but no mucous is coming up at all.  It's an uncomfortable feeling.  My oxygen is perfect 98/99 with oxygen sensor.  I don't get winded walking or anything. It's just constant congested feeling in back and chest and it is awful.  

Thank you"
"Does anyone know a good asthma doctor in New York or telehealth? The one I‚Äôve been seeing sucks and has only given me albuterol, Flovent and symbiocort. None of these have helped and my lungs hurt like crazy nonstop burning and squeezing pain and slightly itchy sensations. can only take shallow breaths otherwise the pain gets worse and worse. Can‚Äôt sit or lay down in any comfortable positions."
I've never monitored my heart rate while having an attack until this morning. My resting rate is typically between 80/90 (for context I'm a 19 yr old female who's not very active) but during my attack it dropped down to high 30s and low 40s...... Abulterol spiked it up (obviously) and it went to the 100s. I was wondering if anyone else has experience bradycardia while having an attack?
My asthma is new I have to get back on my controller med bud had a question bc I was just using a levalbuterol inhaler more than I should since it‚Äôs uncontrolled currently I think I‚Äôm gonna get back on montelkaust but takes 7-14 days to work should I lift weights or can I before that period ? And I also will probably have an inhaler for a controller med tomorrow as well instead of waiting j for the pill. Idk if I can weightlift or use machines or walk long distances. Also is the gym safe ? Should I go with flu or viruses around I had covid in aug n was fine but immunity could wear off n I‚Äôm vaccinated
Does it make anyone throat /sore/hurt? I'm panicking as of I'm coming down with something. I'm suffering covid long Haul so deff don't need no more germs.

"Hello All!

This is my first post here on this lovely supportive subreddit, and let me first state that I have an appointment with my doctor in a couple weeks to discuss the concerns I'm about to share with you below.

As with many of you, I developed asthma very young. A bout with bronchitis in my infancy left me with severe asthma, we're talking hospitalizations, all night nebulizers, and lots of medication. I received immontherapy shots throughout middle, highschool, and part of college. During my school years, bronchitis and pneumonia were a yearly occurence. Fast forward to the present day, I'm 30 and everything *asthma related* seems to be well under control provided I'm taking my current medications, those being Wixela, Singulair, and Nasocort.  Lately though, despite my asthma symptoms being controlled, I can't escape a gnawing and growing anxiety that something is not right with me. 

My heart rate feels high, at 80 on average when lying down. Sometimes when I lay down to nap it feels like it's beating out of my chest. Focusing on deep breaths can give me relief, but it doesn't help to lower my heart rate. I feel a restlessness in my muscles, a restlessness that grows when I refuse to indulge it. All these things effect my sleep. While I generally have a friendly disposition, my mood is fragile and a bit unpredictable, and I am quick to anger. I find it difficult to stay well hydrated despite my attempts to do so. I think it's worth noting here that all of these symptoms match that of generalized anxiety, so I'm not explicitly trying to blame my meds, but I also don't want to assume I can't find a better place to be.

I lift weights 3 times a week, and while I'm not currently doing any cardio, my current symptoms do not preclude me from doing so. 

If any of this is sounding familiar to you, or if you've gone through something similar with any success, I'd love to hear anything you have to say about it, and thank you in advance."
so this might be a stupid question but i‚Äôve just been prescribed montelukast today and i‚Äôve seen a lot of stuff about not taking it with certain painkillers (NSAIDs). i regularly have to take cocodamol for chronic pain and i wanted to know if it‚Äôs ok to take with montelukast. it‚Äôs not an NSAID so i think it should be fine (?) but i can‚Äôt really find much about it. anybody have any experience?
"Hello everyone, I recently went to a minor emergency clinic for a horrible asthma flare up and the doctor prescribed me symbicort. I told her I didn‚Äôt have any health insurance and I was there because I could no longer afford to buy my Breo thus leading me down the path to where I am now with uncontrolled asthma. So I asked her for the cheapest long term corticosteroid inhaler and she said there‚Äôs ways of getting on a payment help program or something like that with manufacturers coupons for these types of inhalers but she really didn‚Äôt explain herself. I am a 35 year old male with no health insurance living in the US (Texas). Does anyone know of a way to get symbicort or any of the long term inhalers at a decent price or know anything about what the doctor was talking about with the manufacturer coupons??? Please I need help I just left the er because I resorted to taking a family members anoro elipta and it almost killed me‚Ä¶ they thought it was just like Breo since they used to be prescribed Breo and would occasionally let me have one of their inhalers since they didn‚Äôt even use them and me being stupid just didn‚Äôt think twice and took the first dose. (Don‚Äôt do what I did)Thank you so much!"
"Hey guys!

Firstly,I would like to say that reading your posts made me realize how tough asthma can be sometimes and I think that each and every one of you is a hero of everyday life.Kudos!Now,I want to share my experience and ask for you opinions.I was diagnosed with asthma last July and I was prescribed a daily couple of doses of Foster (NEXThaler).The thing is that I do not have the conventional symptoms of asthma.No coughing,no wheezing,no trouble breathing when sleeping.The only thing is that I have trouble taking a deep breath,like I have to stretch my back to breath deep down.Also,Foster (or even salbutamol) hasn't helped my situation at all.My pulmonologist says that I should probably do another check up.Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!"
"My son has been coughing continuously since about 17 days now. We went to a doctor 3 days ago and he diagnosed it as cough variant asthma and prescribed fast acting bronchodilators inhaler (Asthalin) and a corticosteroid inhaler (Flohale) to be taken everyday (twice) for 10 days. It has been 3 days since he's been taking these inhalers, but I honestly don't see any improvement of any sort. In fact, it seems to be getting a bit worse.  It worsens especially at night (after 7 pm). I've even tried all sorts of home remedies but it doesn't seem to work either. We took an X-ray of his chest and it was normal too.  
I have no idea what's causing it and i feel helpless. He coughs a lot at night (6+ times every single minute) and complains of lower abdominal pain due to continuous dry cough.   
**The only symptom he has is a dry cough**, nothing else.  

  
Few notes:  
Asthma runs in my family. I have it, my mom has it.  
The weather has been horrible since the past three weeks - heavy rains and cold.  
There's a construction going on above my house (maybe the dust is triggering it?)

I do not know what to do next, we tried inhalers, natural remedies but nothing helps.   
Did any of you face a similar situation in the past? If yes, what did you do to get rid of this persistent dry cough?  
What should I do next as a parent? It hurts to watch him cough every single day, which hasn't improved with inhalers and natural remedies."

"Has anyone ever experienced any skin rashes/irritation from being on Prednisone? I‚Äôve been taking Prednisone for a little over a month now and there‚Äôs little bumps starting at my shoulders and all the way down to my thighs. Going to my doctor tomorrow to see what might be the deal, but I figured I‚Äôd see if anyone else has experienced this. :)"

"Hello all, firstly I‚Äôd like to start by saying I am not seeking medical advice. I‚Äôve already seen several doctors and trying to figure this thing out.


Back in August I developed a cough out of no where. Prior to this I‚Äôve had several times where I felt like I wasn‚Äôt breathing correctly or something was up. My Dr. didn‚Äôt take it seriously. Fast forward to the cough. Barking but not really productive. I called my Dr. and was told to get Covid tested so I did came back negative. They refused to see me in person and told me to go to urgent care. I can‚Äôt just go anywhere due to a past medical case where my immune system all but ceased to exist. I explained that to the urgent care on the phone and they agreed to see me in private after hours. This didn‚Äôt happen. They called back and said they got too busy to try the next day. Same thing the next day. This was about two weeks into the cough. They said go to the ER for a work up to make sure it‚Äôs nothing serious. So I did just that and was told it was bronchitis got sent home with albuterol and steroids. This did absolutely nothing. Cough still was horrendous. 

Few weeks go by and I tried to get back in with my Dr. By then I was already 2 months into having this random cough and they finally scheduled an appointment. I show up at the dr office to be seen and I kid not when I coughed the Dr raised his eyebrows at me told me to take mucinex and sent me home. I was very upset. I started mucinex. Luckily I also see a sleep dr regularly who doubles as a pulmonologist. He seemed concerned and frustrated with my experience with my PCP. He told me to take extra strength mucinex and Claritin. Still weeks of that and nothing. I‚Äôm already 3 months in and discouraged. I decided to get in with a new PCP. Wait time with the new Dr. Is another month. 

I finally get in with the new Dr and he thinks it could be cough variant asthma but isn‚Äôt sure. He prescribed something for GERD which I also have and a breo inhaler. All that to say for those who have cough variant asthma, is yours worse in the mornings? For me when I wake up before I do my inhaler I sound horrible. Sounds like I‚Äôve smoked my entire life but never have. After my inhaler around 3 hours in if I cough it sounds normal. I‚Äôm just confused at this point if this is normal. Also for those who have tried breo or similar is it normal to get the dose all over your tongue? I feel like I‚Äôm not getting the full dose. I follow up in a few weeks with my Dr and will also ask about generic forms of the inhaler. I‚Äôm paying $120 a month for this.

Thanks everyone who takes the time to read this!"
"i have exercise induced asthma and decided i was going to try to run again about a year after i passed out several times doing it. last time, even with the puffer, i continually lost consciousness mid run and after a while decided enough was enough. 

now, i‚Äôm in good shape. i always have been. i workout 2-6 times a week (usually averaging around 4) doing 20-45 minutes of strength training or weightlifting so it‚Äôs not just like i‚Äôm unfit and that‚Äôs the reason for it. 

this leads me to the running thing. i just can‚Äôt run and its so embarrassing. i‚Äôve tried a good few times now, and the longest i can go is about a minute at 12km/h before it triggers and asthma attack, and i have to walk for a couple minutes until it wears off.

all i want is to be able to run or do cardio for a reasonable amount of time without completely losing my breath and or passing out. i dont even know what to do at this point ;/"
"Long story short I‚Äôve suddenly developed asthma at 27 and was hospitalised last week. I‚Äôve been reading a lot and think my attack was triggered by chocolate and red wine (histamine) but my nurse said I was basically being stupid. 

I found MCAS and think I could potentially have it - certain foods make my chest wheeze and I already have tachycardia/stomach issues and osteoarthritis I have no idea if it‚Äôs likely to just come on with no genetic link? 

Really appreciate anyone‚Äôs personal insight thanks so much"
"Has anyone contracted the new ""super cold"" that is prevalent around Europe and some parts of North America? It's knocking everyone on their ass. My gf has never been sick in many years but now she has breathing difficulties etc. I my self have asthma and have COVID and had a very very mild version. I'm really concerned about the new super cold so I'm curious if any of you have had it yet and what your experience was like? Were you vaccinated as well?"
"Not sure if that‚Äôs the proper way this phrase this? Basically in high school I ran track and I sucked but I liked running. However every day to run I‚Äôd have to use my inhaler after each run. After one puff I‚Äôd be good to run all day and have no flare ups. Is this for ever or is there a way to train my lungs so eventually I don‚Äôt need to use the inhaler ever time I do exercise like this? 

I don‚Äôt really need it when I lift weights and stuff. I‚Äôm fine there"
Woke up this morning after 2 nights of no heating. Was freezing walking through the rooms with no fan heater apart from the one in bedroom. Feel breathless now irs back on
"People around me keep saying to eat anti-inflammatory foods to help with asthma. Has anyone tried an anti-inflammatory diet and had positive results?

I'm on a maintenance inhaler btw, but I'm willing to try anything if it'll help more"
"The amount of times i've had to say ""I don't have covid, I have asthma"" is already too high and it's only been below freezing for maybe 3 days :)"
"Hi, I have my first Asthma review (appointment) coming up tomorrow, likely with spirometry.

I am currently taking an ICS/LABA controller (Fostair) twice daily. 
I read online, that you should withhold any LABA up to 48 hours before spirometry and SABA (and caffeine) for up to four hours. 
Am I mistaken here? 

I have not received any specific instructions from them despite asking.

What do you do? 
Anything you usually do before your appointment?"
"i am taking accountability here , i have been smoking and it has been making my asthma a lot worse . Middle of the night i woke up coughing and wheezing and this morning i almost have this GERD like feeling which i believe has happened before past years but im wondering if anyone else gets this ?"
"Does anyone know if Montelukast is a controller med, it‚Äôs in a pill form not inhaler"
"The asthma diagnosis is pretty new to me so I don‚Äôt really know what to do when I get sick. I have doubled up my asthma medication and covid-19 test is negative.

I‚Äôve been sick for a two weeks now. I have a sore throat, cough and a stuffy nouse. The cough might be the worst of the symptoms. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs caused by the cold or the asthma (maybe both). Sometimes I‚Äôve had a slight shortness of breath, but it has gone away when I used my rescue inhaler. I feel ok and I haven‚Äôt had a fever the whole time. It just feels like that this damn cold doesn‚Äôt go away.

How long can I observe the situation? When you know it‚Äôs time to go to the doctor? What are the ‚Äùwarning signs‚Äù that there might be a problem which requires more medicine?"

"The flixotide inhalers don‚Äôt have a dose counter but they say they have 120 actuations. They also say to prime it 2puffs before first use. So, does this mean they have 120 actuations after priming or before priming?"
"I‚Äôm currently taking montelukast and have taken it only during the spring of 2020 when my asthma started. Now my asthma is bothering me again during the fall which isn‚Äôt normal so I scheduled a doctors appointment. At the doctor she could tell from my ears and throat that I was reacting to allergies so recommended that in addition to montelukast at night, that I take a Zyrtec in the morning. I‚Äôve read montelukast reviews about crazy dreams and never had any problems until the past two days when I added the Zyrtec to my routine. My dreams have now been way scarier, vivid only I‚Äôm usually a more vivid dreamer, and seem longer as well. I think somehow it‚Äôs the combination that‚Äôs doing this and I wonder if other people who take montelukast only noticed crazy dreams after adding an additional antihistamine to their routine."
"At night, I have wheezing. It feels like my airway (words escape me tonight) is tight and my upper chest feels constricted.

I‚Äôm also constantly trying to clear my throat of mild/sticky mucus every night. And sometimes in the morning.

Occasionally I end up taking my inhaler, but I‚Äôm not keen on doing that very often because it‚Äôs a 50/50 chance that I can either suddenly breathe again (feels like my lungs were deflated and after a puff, they abruptly open up - the weirdest sensation!) OR I end up with the immediate sharp need to cough. I can spend 30 minutes hacking my lungs up when this happens and it‚Äôs uncomfortable/uncontrollable. However, I DO feel immense relief after the coughing fit.

Is this typical? My doctor has been less than helpful. I was on montelukast and it greatly reduced my nightly symptoms BUT it ultimately messed with my mood."
"I was diagnosed with asthma for the first time at 19 years old. I was going through a stressful time in my life and got an asthma attack, along with psoriasis which can be caused by stress. I noticed whenever I have an ‚Äúasthma attack‚Äù my rescue inhaler never works and I‚Äôm always sent to the hospital or have to do a breathing treatment. I‚Äôm starting to wonder maybe I have something else &amp; was curious if anyone else has had this happened. Background: I used to smoke cigarettes in high school from 15-23 years old. I quit finally at 23 and my asthma has cleared up a little ( less attacks) but I never had asthma when I was younger."

I‚Äôve always have had a bad cough. When I was younger if I was running around too much or laughing I would break into a coughing fit and it would get worse when my allergies were bad along with my shortness of breath. Ive been walking up my school stairs twice every day for the past three months and my shortness of breath just gets worse everyday and I try to suppress my cough if it‚Äôs too bad.
"Since a few weeks ago, I started having trouble breathing sometimes, mostly in the evening. The thing is, my Ventolin inhaler didn't help much. I started looking online and felt like my problem might be post nasal drip, or in other words, mucus was accumulating in my throat. Indeed, I didn't have any typical signs of asthma like a weezing breath. One thing internet recommended was gargling salted warm water, which I did and to my relief it worked. However, it's been a few weeks now and I have to do this ritual every night now, sometimes even in the middle of the day, combined with my Ventolin inhaler... I've tried identifying the triggers, which at first I thought to be my cat or dust, since these were present at my first attacks, but the attacks started occurring now without any of these triggers present. The gargling and inhaler help, but I'm afraid it's getting less and less helpful, while the attacks are increasing. Has anyone felt this way before, and if so what is this called, what are the triggers and how do I make it stop? Of course I'm going to see my doctor, but since I recently moved he won't know anything of my situation, so I'd like to come and see him with some ideas of what it may be."
"First time on this sub as I'm still figuring things out, but I was wondering if anyone could relate or offer advice while I'm figuring this out.  So I've always had issues with breathing during exercise and just shied away from cardio most of my life, but it had gotten so bad I couldn't talk while walking.  My family's excuse was I needed to exercise more.

Flash forward to today and I decide to go to my first asthma test, I do the peak flow volume test and it comes back at just barely 50%  They have me inhale  albuterol?  For 10 minutes then repeat the test, my flow volume is the same, but I don't feel like I'm going to pass out this time.  

My next step is getting  a more in depth pulmonary function test done.  I don't have any diagnosis confirmed yet but has anyone had a similar experience?   Does this sound like an asthma diagnosis?  Or is it something else and where can I expect to go from here?

Thanks!"
"I've been on Singulair for about a month, and accidentally skipped a dose tonight (ran out, will get more tomorrow). I had some side effects when I first started it, but have gotten over it now that my body's gotten used to it. If I skip my dose tonight, will I experience side effects again when I take it again tomorrow? I'm flying the day after and one of the side effects I got was anxiety...and I'm already an anxious flyer. 

Thank you!"
"I have asthma and allergies. My room smells odd and the air quality in it is weird. When I try to sleep in my room, I can‚Äôt, because I wake up unable to breathe. My room has also been a huge mess for many years. 

To combat this, I took almost everything out of my room and put in a dehumidifier/air filter (my plan is to clean the walls, floors, ceiling, and inside of closet and then put in all new stuff). However, it‚Äôs still hard to breathe, and the air still feels markedly different to the other rooms in the house, which all have way more stuff in them and are just as messy as mine was.

I don‚Äôt know what could make my room so different. Do you think it‚Äôs just dust? Could it have anything to do with the positioning of my room relative to the airflow of the rest of the house, or the fact my room borders the bathroom and specifically the shower (and our bathroom vent doesn‚Äôt work too great), or the fact that my dad smokes and idk maybe the air gets trapped in my room for some reason, or the fact I never open my windows (but neither does anyone else in the house), or some other thing I‚Äôm not even thinking of? Maybe there‚Äôs mold somewhere that I don‚Äôt know about?

I don‚Äôt know what to do lol I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep in my room in multiple years and I‚Äôm just very very confused and I have no idea what kind of professional would be able to help in this situation"
"Last February my 5 year old got very sick with croup. She coughed for 5 months before the doctor prescribed albuterol (all the other things didn‚Äôt help). Right after this she finally saw a pulmonologist (yes it took that long to get in) the doctor put her on Flovent but her cough had already stopped from the albuterol. She‚Äôs been on Flovent for 3 months, she got sick about a month ago and she‚Äôs been coughing a wet cough every day. We‚Äôve increased the albuterol which has helped her this last week. 

What I‚Äôm wondering is if the Flovent is even doing anything or if it‚Äôs only the albuterol. The Flovent didn‚Äôt stop her cough to begin with, only albuterol and the Flovent didn‚Äôt prevent her chronic cough when getting sick. I just don‚Äôt want to pump her with steroids if she doesn‚Äôt need it. She took a lung capacity test and scored 110% she was unable to perform the pft to get results but they looked good. Does she just get extra sick but not actually have asthma? Is the Flovent even helping? Albuterol is for sure. Sorry for the long post. I‚Äôve talked to her dr and they want her on the Flovent through winter but I‚Äôm skeptical"
"As a kid I had varying breathing difficulties, as far as I can remember it was all due to allergies. But I also had sinus surgery at 8 years old to remove my adenoids after getting extremely sick (but not my tonsils). Had one period of extreme pneumonia where air was in bed for a couple weeks, out of school.


I was on inhalers, breathing treatments, sick a lot then movee to cingulair medication after my surgery. Dr removed this when I went into Middle school and haven't been treated for it since. Just over the counter allergy medicine when I really needed it, because it makes me so overwhelmingly tired, no matter the dose. I have year round sinus drainage and allergies for pretty much every season. I live in a humid state, so I stay inside as much as possible in summer.


Anytime I go outside recently (past few weeks) I can barely take half a breath before my chest is too tight and I cough. Going up and down my stairs leaves me really out of breath with a tight chest. 

I know no one can diagnose me here, but I want to see if this sounds similar to anyone else's experience. 
(I also have the bonus of longterm anxiety/depression)"
"Am I right to assume that the number over the 50 basically, not literally, correlates to how severe your asthma is?

So, for the past year I've been on 100/50 because that's just what my doctor prescribed. I would call my asthma under control, but I did go through a couple of rescue inhalers (so not really all that controlled). After a bit of an issue with that doctor, I decided to seek other help and this new doctor immediately prescribed 500/50

Before doctor 1, I was on 250/50 and it seemed alright, doctor 1 said (and honestly maybe my memory is just janked up) that 100/50 was the highest level available, but now doctor 2 is prescribing the exact opposite end of whatever metric the advair is on.

My thought prior to doctor 1 was that the different levels just described how much medicine you were getting per dose. Post doctor 1, I thought maybe it was more related to a percentage, not 500 over 50 but maybe 500 times less strong. I dunno, I thought it was weird, but again, unreliable narrator, there may have been some other reason that doctor 1 gave me and my memory just won't allow me to access it. 

But I've looked it up and it seems like I was right the first time, the number refers to how much medicine you get per actuation. Just making this post to double check to make sure that is correct and that I definitely made the right choice getting a new doctor."
"Hi! I've been wondering if anyone here has the same condition as me. I was diagnosed with asthma since childhood and later skin itch started to appear. When I went to the doctor, he said it was an eczema or skin asthma or others call it atopic dermatitis."
"I currently have heavy tightness in my chest that isn't relieved by ventolin or manageable with most varieties of long term preventor puffers. I have no wheezing, no coughing. Just tightness, causing difficulty when inhaling, and also creating a constant sense of dyspnea. When I used to be healthy, when I breathed I could feel the air inside my lower airways, but now I can't feel that.

My doctor thinks I have some sort of chronic inflammation developed over a long period of exposure to irritants and infections. The irritants being dogs, and infections being a long term exposure to a strain of atypical pneumonia that went undiagnosed for a long time. 

I'm just wondering does anyone have asthma with symptoms like me?"
"Hello,

Tl;dr: chronic cough that has been ongoing for the last 3 months. Doctors haven‚Äôt been able to do much,as I sound heathy to them. Been taking steroid puffer for a month straight and new breathing problems have arose in the last two weeks. 

I‚Äôve had Asthma since I was a kid (I think 3, now 16) but it wasn‚Äôt really bothersome unless I was exercising, but even then it was a bit of wheezing and I could still breathe. I had a blue puffer just for when I had really bad attacks but those happened on the rare occasion (I‚Äôm talking years in between).

But in late July early august I had developed this dry cough when the fires in BC were happening (I live in BC), I wasn‚Äôt worried about covid as usually when there‚Äôs smoke in the air I start coughing anyways. But the problem was my cough got worse and worse to the point I couldn‚Äôt walk up stairs without wheezing and coughing. On September 1st I went to the ER, the doctor tested for covid (came out negative), and gave me a blue rescue puffer, and a red steroid puffer. I use the steroid puffer 4 times a day, twice in the morning, twice at night, along with the blue one before I take the red one. I took that for 3 weeks, had a bit of a difference but I was coughing until I was dizzy and had developed this feeling of flem going down the back of my throat every time I swallow, and I will try to cough it up but I can‚Äôt. 

I seen my doctor 2 weeks after this, she said my lungs were clear but my right lung sounded quieter than my left so I got an X-ray. The X-ray came out with nothing, my lungs looked good apparently, but I still have this cough. I stopped taking my puffers as my doctor said if they didn‚Äôt help much to stop taking them. I got sick in the middle of October, ended up going to the ER because I could hardly breathe. The doctor there said my lungs sounded like they were working evenly but am having a flare up because of the cold, so he gave me 3 prednisone tablets to take over the course of 3 days then starting my puffers back up. (Also got treated for covid, it was negative) That week I‚Äôm able to talk to my doctor again, she won‚Äôt send a referral for me to go see a respiratory specialist until I can take a Pulmonary test at the hospital, along with an allergy test. This was a month ago, I just got an allergy test on Monday, I‚Äôm not allergic too all the common allergies. 

So I‚Äôm now left waiting to get a phone call from the hospital for the test, I was given no timeline on when I‚Äôd get the test due to covid, I can‚Äôt go see a respiratory specialist. Within the last 2 weeks I‚Äôve been getting a tight chest, and having a hard time getting air in my lungs. My inhalers don‚Äôt help very much if at all to combat this or my coughing, yet according to all the different doctors I‚Äôve seen, my lungs sound fine. 

I‚Äôm kinda at my wits end at the moment because it is getting worse without any sort of answers. I‚Äôve been taking my inhalers 4 times a day everyday for a month and 1 week straight. 
I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else has/is experiencing anything like this and has any advice to help. 
Thank you for reading my tedtalk lol."
"Hey guys so for over a month I‚Äôve had a cough but it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúsick‚Äù cough. It‚Äôs pretty annoying because i feel like my anxiety makes it worse. I also feel like my throat tightens up and i feel like i can‚Äôt swallow or breathe normally but maybe it‚Äôs a panic attack. My doctor says it‚Äôs anxiety but it‚Äôs been going on for over a month. 
Also I went to the ER September 1st for a really bad panic attack because i couldn‚Äôt breathe it was really scary. I just want answers. I‚Äôm tired of feeling this way and wondering what‚Äôs wrong with me."

"My rescue inhalers are at 194 and 197 when I haven't used one, aside from priming it, and only used the other a few times? Do the numbers go down through time if they get bumped around a bit?"

"every once in a while i will fall asleep WAY quicker than i usually do, and within 30-60 minutes i wake up in full confusion and every time i cough i have this chemical-ly kinda taste and it hurts in my chest and even teeth?? 

its just that it happened just now and its been 8 days since the last time, when it normally happens 1-2 months apart. i know its the dry weather, but its so annoying because i want to just sleep lol

its just so annoying, i just hope it doesnt affect me too badly tomorrow"
"So I‚Äôm finally going home for the holidays to see my family and I have a six hour flight ahead of me. My asthma always gets really bad after I get a cold and while I do use the inhalers, it won‚Äôt go away until about two weeks after the cold ends. Well, my cold is gone but my asthmatic coughs are still bad and I‚Äôm so nervous about flying.

Particularly not because of the triggers or anything but because people might think I have COVID or look at me badly. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Does anyone have any advice for when they flew and they had an asthma flare up? Should I tell the stewardess? Should I not say anything at all? Should I tape a sign to my head that says I don‚Äôt have covid, only severe asthma?????? I‚Äôm scared."
"Let me tell you my story, I am a medical student and my teacher in the class asked us to ask our relatives and friends what diseases they had, I dedicated myself wind and tide to looking in all my friends for someone sick, to what I found A friend with asthma which I presented in my class, the problem is that the doctor is now asking us for an examination or evidence of his disease, which my friend does not have since those tests were done when he was a child :c :c and the fool lost those papers. Now I come to you asking if any of you could help me with a photo of any of your exams without any personal information in order to avoid the wrath of my teacher :c :c :''D"
"After my first asthma attack I‚Äôve been reading a lot and think I might have histamine intolerance. I had an attack the day after eating chocolate and a glass of red wine :( 

Do you cut out any foods or find any that are complete no go‚Äôs?"
"Apparently there's a shortage of Dulara, my daily asthma meds. I nearly was crying at the pharmacy counter.

I asked if there was any way i could get the lower dose but the lady insisted i call around to see if anyone else has it, otherwise i just need to rely on my rescue inhaler.

Even with insurance or good rx going to a different pharmacy would cost $300-$500 for a months supply. 

I‚Äôm so distraught, especially since my lungs were BARELY getting back to normal after wildfire season. 

Any one else affected by this?"
"Hey guys! 

I'm 23 years old and I've had exercise induced asthma since I was a kid. During my teens I took pulmicort (cortisone) regularly and Buventol (beta-2-agonist) before exercise. Now when I've gotten older I no longer need the pulmicort but still take Buventol when needed.

However, ever since I can remember I very easily catch colds and have episodes over 3 - 6 weeks with 3 - 4 minor to bad colds after one another. I have these episodes 2 - 3 times per year and I'm very tired of it. I do however very rarely get sick of anything else than colds and only catch the flu every 2 - 3 years. 

I've taken all tests possible at the primary care unit (I live in Sweden) and it doesn't point in the direction of an immune deficiency disorder. 

However, something obviously isn't right and I wonder if anyone else has experienced something similar and been able to tie it to their asthma diagnosis? What medication have you been prescribed  and how has it helped you?"
"Hi guys, I‚Äôve been struggling with a breathing problem and feel like this may be the best place to ask for advice :)

So basically around 2 years ago I got a really bad flu and since have had post viral symptoms. 

However one I haven‚Äôt understood and have received 0 support from is my breathing.

I am able to walk and do aerobic exercise fine but upon exertion my throat just seems to tighten up and it‚Äôs really hard to breath, I also get quite bad PEM and I don‚Äôt know if this is due to my poor breath work. At times too mainly when I‚Äôm trying to sleep my throat will occasionally tighten up.

I am not sure how likely it is that I have asthma as I don‚Äôt typically wheeze. Is it still likely that I do or could anyone advise on what else it could possibly be :)"
"I‚Äôve had asthma my whole life (30F). I was a premature baby (28 weeks) and diagnosed when I was 1 or 2 years old. I had pretty bad childhood asthma and was in the ER with asthma attacks pretty regularly. But *knocks on wood* I‚Äôve had amazing asthma control for the past five years and have had very few symptoms, except for a very occasional allergy-related wheezing episode. I‚Äôm on singulair, symbicort 80, fluticasone nasal spray, and azelastine nasal spray. My pulmonologist even moved my symbicort to once a day during my ‚Äúoff season‚Äù in spring/summer.

However, I got a nasty cold that turned into a sinus infection after going on vacation. I‚Äôm vaxxed but I‚Äôve been Covid tested several times over this, all negative. After a few days of sinus symptoms, I started wheezing and coughing and using my rescue inhaler often, especially at night and in the morning. I also ended up having a really scary asthma attack, my first in decades. It felt like I was trying to breathe through straws. My primary care put me on augmentin and a steroid dose pack (30mg, tapering). 

Well, I‚Äôm on the last day of the steroid dosepack, and my sinus symptoms are mostly better but I‚Äôm still wheezing and coughing at night and in the morning. What gives?? I‚Äôm worried if I go back on more steroids, I am risking more long term side effects, like adrenal fatigue. Should I tough it out and see if this improves on its own? Am I jumping the gun by calling my pulmonologist?"
already had 2 episodes this week so now i gotta change my life style to avoid it from happening any more .
"Hi, i am not asking for a diagnosis, more to just find someone who goes through the same and maybe has advice on how i should describe this to my doc because i struggle to do so.

I  (28) am NB Transmasc and go by He/Him but was asigned female at birth which i guess plays a big role in that.

I never had a coughing asthma attack or something like that.

But There are days where symtoms are creeping up and i have trouble breathing.
When this happens i always feel that no matter how slow and steady and good i inhale, my body doesn't get enough oxigen.  I usually get really tired, drousy, dizzy and have this urge to cough and weird feeling in my chest. Like a pressure feeling maybe... a lil burn? Sometimes it's so bad i can't really get out of bed as i fear to faint. The tiniest movements get me out of breath.

I also see that i have those days when something hormonal happens like ovulation or pms (before the period). 

Have that since years and it seems to get worse...

A friend of mine who has asthma all her life told me that there is also something called pms asthma or hormonal asthma? 

I just feel stupid describing this to my doctor as i fear that she won't believe me ans tells me it's ""anxiety"".... i know my anxiety symtoms very well and o holy this is not it. also because i'm actually very calm when this happens it just confuses me.
Second reason is , as i mentioned above, i never had an asthma attack with coughing and stuff...

is this asthma? And to dose of you who also experience that, could you describe it to me?"
newly diagnosed asthmatic here! just had my second asthma attack (and anxiety attack) since being diagnosed and i was wondering what you guys do to wind down afterwards. it happened right as i was trying to fall asleep and obviously it can be a very scary and nasty experience so i was wondering if anybody has any tips or tricks to wind down/relax after an asthma attack
"Hey there,

Recently, I went to the hospital for a very serious asthma attack that was fueled by pneumonia. I should've died but I survived which I am very grateful for. However when I left hospital and resumed my activities after 2 months like the doctor advised, I feel like I have forgotten how to breath. Like when I think about breathing which is very often or during exercise, my body doesn't breath and I have to consciously control my breathing and I feel like I'm not taking in enough air because it feels like my body wouldn't breathe by itself without me initiating breathing. Does anyone have a similar experience, and if so, any advice? I am quite athletic so I am very concerned.(I live in north America if that matter)."

My 5 year old daughter is on Flovent and albuterol. She was fine before she got sick but after having a cold she constantly coughs. Is this what it‚Äôs like to have asthma when you get sick? We talked to her doctor and she said to give her more albuterol but that hasn‚Äôt really helped
"Hi y'all,

I am wondering if people here have gotten the booster shot/have any experiences? I have asthma due to an overactive immune system, am on biologics and got the J&amp;J months before I learned that I was not supposed to due to a medication interaction that exacerbated my side effects. I was one of the rare people who had an adverse reaction and well, here I am doing it all over again! In any case, because of my meds my asthma is almost totally controlled. Getting a Pfizer booster, not feeling nervous at all just wondering if anyone had any experiences to share in general since boosters are becoming widely available--thanks!"

"(Everyone is different so it‚Äôs not 100% enough to just rely on what you may read in the comments, however it is just food for thought. Refer to you doctor/GP for more info.)

I‚Äôve always wanted to help those who are struggling. I want this post to be a place where people can provide useful and helpful information for newly diagnosed asthmatics. 

Asthma attacks are literally the scariest thing i‚Äôve ever felt/experienced and can be life-threatening. But with the right medication you can manage it and not need to worry too much about it. 

Tips I‚Äôd like to start off with:

- Learn to use your inhaler correctly

- Use a Spacer

- Get refills on your medication (sounds obvious but some people forget! me lolüòÖ)

- Carry your inhaler(s) with you at all times (you never know when you might have symptoms)

- Take your preventative maintenance medication on time!

- Avoid your triggers

Anyways thanks for reading! If you want to add something, feel free! Have good one :)"

"I developed asthma about three years ago whenever I got pet rats (I know haha) and it turned out I was really allergic to them. I had never had shortness of breath or asthma or anything prior to getting them. 
I felt too bad giving them away so kept them for two and a half years with well controlled asthma most of the time. 

Had a couple of times when I couldn‚Äôt even walk when I had a chest infection. Think this is because the rats were in my bedroom so I was just constantly irritated by them. Only ever had one proper attack when hiking on a very cold day. 

Since no longer having rats, I have not had many issues - I can run short distances and walk in the cold and even when I‚Äôm sick it‚Äôs completely fine. Only thing is I have to walk up six flights of stairs to get to class some days which knocks me out a little but not enough to need an inhaler. 

ANYWAY TLDR: my question is, is it likely that since my asthma was caused/triggered by keeping rats, is it likely that it will go away completely in the future now that I don‚Äôt have them? Has anyone else had an experience like this?"
"Bit of background information, I'm 28, male, 6ft and got diagnosed with Asthma at the start of the year. I noticed slight breathing problems at the start of 2020 but didn't follow up on them until that Christmas when I noticed shortness of breath lying down.

After being given a peak flow meter I was averaging a score of 390. After playing around with different inhalers we have managed to improve this to a score of around 500 (still not great but a decent 25% improvement -  only get out of breath going up steps or with moderate activity now). I have been advised the next step would be to move onto steroid tablets if I believe I needed further relief, however I am hesitant due to the side affects.

My questions is, is it normal to have this level of Asthma but never have an asthma attack?

As a side note I've had a number of tests to confirm I do not have anything else underlying, including:

Blood tests
Chest Xray
CT scan
CPET test

Nothing came back of any concern."
"So I'm just joining this group and hopefully can find some tips to improve. I've just generally been getting worse asthma or allergies when exercising more than walking. I cough for a while in the morning, but I think I'm doing better now for just basics with singular, claratin, Flonase, and breo.

But my albuteral inhaler has pretty much never done anything for more than 9/10x. Using it before, during, after or even during coughing fits doesn't seem to help at all. It hasn't since I first got it about 8 years ago (though I have new ones and was warned to make sure it's never hitting expiration).

I've been through several different doctors, but I think it's generally getting worse, though it's calmed down finally when just sitting from the past few years.

I just NEED some exercise to balance me out.

Any ideas I haven't tried are really appreciated!"
I only have one random inhaler called foracort. I don't know if it's safe to use as I have never used a steroid inhaler. Someone please help.
"I have no idea what the hell happened, but my flovent and albuterol puffers are almost impossible to take the cap off of. How is it done?

I missed the old design where it hung onto the puffer itself."
"cant afford an inhaler or anything for that matter. any tips? back feels heavy, hard to breathe"
"After I dance, my feet/ankles feel numb (no tingling/pins and needles), my arms feel like jelly (super weak‚Ä¶ I could barely pick up my Gatorade bottle), and I am out of breath for at LEAST 5 minutes, sometimes more. Does this sound like asthma or exercise-induced asthma?"
"Hi r/asthma!
I recently quit taking antihistamines due to the inability for me to clear my lungs out when I'm having an episode. What other allergy medications can I take for daily hives? I can't remove myself from the allergen because it's as soon as I walk in the door my calves/legs break out, and it travels up to my belly and back. I have no idea what is triggering it. The contraindication for antihistamines with asthma is that your lungs do not secrete as much fluid, and the the stuff that is there becomes very sticky and thick (thanks Pharmacology). It makes it much harder for me to cough it up. I can't call my pharmacy cause it's sunday and I really need relief asap."
"I‚Äôm 21, i have mild asthma, it doesn‚Äôt usually bother me that much, other than when my allergies flare up, and with exercise. Since fall started i‚Äôve been struggling a lot with exercise (horse back riding). I‚Äôm currently not taking any controller medication but i guess i should get back to it. My dr recommended that i take 2 puffs of ventolin before i ride, which i tried the other day and i felt so tired I couldn‚Äôt finish my lesson. I was still getting out of breath, and my body felt like jello, so shaky and i had no strength. 
I read that relievers usually cause shakiness, so my question is, how do you manage this? I tried it again yesterday, went for a short walk/run (short running intervals), and then when my lungs got tired i took a puff. 
A minute later i felt like i was dragging my feet on the floor, struggling to walk normally. 
Any tips?"
I‚Äôve had asthma for over 10 years now started on advair was hospitalized every winter for weeks getting cut off from inhaler refills constantly in distress blew up from prednisone they bumped me up to the max nothing worked got H1N1 stuck in the hospital couldn‚Äôt talk or move for over a week before they finally broke my wheeze I almost died airways were totally sealed monitors beeping like crazy all these drs ran in it was terrifying that made me finally switch to a pulmonologist instead of just my primary and he prescribed me breo it was life changing. I haven‚Äôt been admitted to the hospital in years one or two ER visits for a bad attack but that‚Äôs it. Dropped the extra weight got back into the gym I love how breo has changed my life but I started reading the long term effects and they are not a good time I want to start taking vitamins to combat the possible osteoporosis and other issues but I was wondering besides sea moss and chorella does anyone know of any other natural alternatives that can help with asthma? I‚Äôve accepted that I might have to be on steroids the rest of my life but anything that could possibly help that from not happening would be amazing I‚Äôm all ears and sorry if this is repetitive and already been posted I‚Äôm new here lol
What have you noticed since getting it?
"I went into a severe flair after having a cold that turned into a chest infection.  After steroids and antibiotics, doc now has me on Breztri and nebulizing four times a day and I feel so much better in just one week.  

Just wanted to share for anyone who may get prescribed Breztri.  I read about it and wasn‚Äôt sure but, it‚Äôs working and I‚Äôm finally feeling good after a long period of struggling."
"As hx, I'm 53 and I've had asthma since 17. It was very bad for a long time, got pretty well controlled on Xolair, took Xolair for about 10 years then stopped and was fairly well controlled. I have bad flare ups maybe 4x a year now.

I've been sick about 3 weeks. No wheezing but chest pressure, tightness, feel like I can't get a full breath, and really bad coughing thru the day way worse at night. Getting into coughing fits I can't get out of, exhausted. Just feel crappy. Had telemed appt about 2 weeks ago. Was prescribed a Z pack, steroid burst, Benzonatate, Codeine Guaifen cough syrup, albuterol thru nebulizer, already taking Trelegy. Got a smidge better on the last day of steroids. Felt almost OK for 2 days then really sick again. My doctor's office couldn't get me in yesterday so I went to Urgent Care. 

She listens to my chest, doesn't hear a wheeze. Knew she wouldn't...I'm not wheezing. And tried to send me on my way. Told me I had 5 star treatment and if that didn't cure it, it wasn't asthma and I had no airway restriction. Tried to blame stress , then pollutants, then just said I had a virus and it would take time.

I told her she was entirely dismissive, I'm not someone to overuse medical care.  In fact I have probably had about 6 doctors lecture me over the years about how asthma can be fatal and I need to treat it that way. After this she decided to give me a chest xray. 

She came back all contrite because it shows that I have minimal bibasilar atelectasis which is partial collapse in both lungs. Like yeah bitch I told you I was struggling to breathe and need help!

My O2 sat was OK at like 97/98. She had me get up and walk a few yards with her and it fell to 91. She sat me down and it recovered quickly. Then she told me if it had dropped below 90 she would've been required to send me to the hospital. She just gave me a Medrol injection and a prescription for higher dose steroids and told me to go to a pulmonologist. 

Bottom line she negated my symptoms bc she didn't hear a wheeze, I challenged her on that, she appeased me with an xray and found 2 partially collapsed lungs. ALWAYS ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELVES!!  I wish you all good health and comfort. This sucks!"
"I know that I sound idiotic but just hear me out.

I've had asthma ever since I was a kid and I pretty much lived with it my whole life. Smoking was absolutely out of the question because I was already having trouble breathing and didn't wanna make life harder than it already is.

Then I turned 20, said it fuck it and smoked weed for the first time (yes I did weed before cigarettes). I didn't know how to inhale properly at first but after trying a couple times I was finally stoned and absolutely loved it. The smoke was a little harsh and I did cough a few times, but it didn't stop me from doing it again.

One year and a lot of smoking later I don't even have asthma problems anymore, I breath perfectly fine and don't wake up in the middle of the night wheezing like my soul is escaping my lungs.

I don't know if it's a coincidence or if THC has some medicinal properties, either way this is not medical advice and I'm not encouraging anyone to go do the same thing I did, I'm simply sharing my experience."
"Here's my experience with asthma medicine (not intended as advice for others)

I used to take advair every day (twice a day) for probably about 10 years. I was diagnosed with asthma and had several bouts of pneumonia in childhood, and was prescribed zyrtec, advair, flonase, and an abuteral inhaler. 

I was super religious about taking all the meds, including the advair, for so long. (like, when you‚Äôre a chid who needs regular medication to control a condition, every adult around you is like constantly indoctrinating you into how important it is to remember your meds every day) and I assumed it was helping control my asthma. I always flushed my mouth with saltwater and brushed my teeth after taking it. It still gave me thrush once. 

At some point in young adulthood I just completely stopped taking advair. I didn‚Äôt like how my throat felt after using it. I always had a suspicion it was, like, making my throat dry and hoarse? But I had been taking it every day so I didn‚Äôt have any way of comparing what it felt like to use it longterm vs not after so long. I eventually got lazy‚ÄîI felt like I had to constantly be seeing a Dr. to re-up the prescription, and I was tired of doing that. It was expensive. And I didn't feel like doing it twice a day.

After I stopped taking it, there wasn‚Äôt a huge difference in my breathing. I‚Äôve actually had fewer respiratory infections (I used to just, get respiratory infections.. all the time). Now in adulthood, my asthma almost never bothers me. I still have shitty allergies, so I still take zyrtec during allergy season, flonase if it's really bad. I often take albuteral before exercise. But I can go long periods of time feeling extremely healthy while taking nothing (other than getting my flu/covid shot.) It‚Äôs been many years now and I can‚Äôt imagine going back to the advair regimen."

"I‚Äôve only officially had asthma for 2 months but haven‚Äôt seen a specialist. Last night I started feeling crappy and coughing and today it got worse until I was wheezing and went to accident and emergency. 

They put me on a nebuliser for a few hours and it helped so much. I‚Äôm at home now and exhausted and scared of it happening again. 

Any advice or tips? I feel really out of my depth managing this since I live alone and have no clue what my triggers are 

Thanks"
"Hi there! I tested positive for Covid-19 this morning. I have asthma but it is regulated with my daily dosage of asmanex (not the twist inhaler). 

I was curious what advice people have for pushing through this virus? Should I use my albuterol? Should I take anti inflammatory medicine? What helped you? And what should I expect? 

I am checking my oxygen levels. Last it was at 94%. So not terrible. But my doctor said to go to the ER if I drop to 90%.  

I am having symptoms, stuffy nose, congestion, and a slight sore throat. It feels like a sinus infection."

"I just saw the pulmonologist who prescribes me Nucala. I actually met her for the first time. We only spoke on the phone last year. This time last year I was a disaster, apparently my lungs were 69% and now they are 85%. She said I could start running again if I wanted. She was happy with my progress.  I spend a lot of time still anxious, I think that‚Äôs just life after a near-fatal asthma attack. But‚Ä¶It was nice she had good news about me."
"Hey everyone, 

I just want to ask, anyone experience asthma only when you have chronic cough? Because this is what I had. It starts with normal cough, and then got worse and the asthma slowly follows.

Fortunately, I haven't had it for the last 5 years. 

I tried searching it online but nothing came up. I had asthma since around 12 years old, and now I'm 21."
Whenever I am having an asthma attack I tend to see white dots in my vision as if I was looking at the night sky and seeing stars. It only happens for a couple seconds then disappear as fast as they appeared. I just wonder if anyone experiences this or knows what they are. I doubt they're floaters because I've seen floaters before and they don't look like that. I doubt this is a cause of concern I'm just curious.
"I'm not going to have a heart attack, am I? I've used this inhaler before. I keep trying breathing tactics but don't know which one (if any) actually help lower my heart rate. How do I know if I need to go get help? I can breathe fine now, my heart rate just worries me."
"I've always been a huge gum chewer and it's helped my anxiety a lot over the last several years, but stopped recently since I'd heard ingredients in gum can be bad for asthma and I got paranoid. Is this BS or does anyone else get triggered by it?"
"Can I get an award or something? Obviously, a lot of this was luck, but I still did advocate for myself and get vaccinated against the flu. First flu shot of my entire life!"
"I've recently considered dropping my just pulmonary Dr bc my allergist also has a lot of experience in treating asthma. 

But I saw the nurse practioner for the second time and I left feeling good bc she remembered me from 6 months ago (I was one of her first patients at the practice) AND she listened to me! She suggested a short course of steroids to see if it helped with the on and off tightness I've had recently. Well I have some very odd but concerning reactions to high doses of oral steriods and not the normal ones. High doses make me extremely sleepy and lethargic and I completely lose my appetite so I can't do more than like 10mg a day (but they do work as long as I'm not on them often, which I'm not). She said let's wait then and see because I'm doing my normal stuff when I get this way. But of course I'm to call asap if I have issues. It was just nice that she actually listened to me. 

I do well with steroid shots but not oral routes and I know that and most Dr's in the past have ignored it but get frustrated when I refuse."
"I take the blue puffer as needed and the orange one twice a day. This morning I had to take the blue one and have felt anxious and shakey all day. 

Does anyone else experience this? 

I was mistakingly taking the blue one everyday last month and it left me an anxious mess. I took it today because I needed it, and bam anxious again."
"My doctor's think that I have asthma since I have told them all my symptoms and all match up to asthma, I got my (Albuterol) inhaler 2 months ago? And recently it hasn't been working for me, I still get a really sharp pain in my chest, coughing, whistling sound in my through. And it's really painful, could it be something else?"
My lungs are diminished to less than half. My left lung is barely moving air and my right is struggling. I feel like crap. My pulmonologist isn‚Äôt answering the phone/emails and I know the ER won‚Äôt do anything I haven‚Äôt. I hate this.
"Potentially stupid post incoming. Recently i smoked weed daily for about a week and a half, i used to smoke weed daily when i was younger and stopped for my lungs. But i did recently and it just ruined me. I‚Äôve used my inhaler‚Ä¶. A lot in the past 3 weeks. i am weirdly ashamed of the amount i have used it. I‚Äôm not someone who goes to the doctor and I‚Äôm working up the courage to do it, i know my asthma isn‚Äôt controlled enough. I am very scared of doctors from not going most of my life and i know it has to change. Do i just see a normal doctor for this or is it a specific type or something? My symptoms are better after stopping smoking again but should i be more concerned? Lately i still need my inhaler 3-5 times a day, although i exercise 2 hours a day and use it during those times too. Anyway sorry if I‚Äôm leaving out anything important"
"My Mom called my doctor and she said it might be cough-variant asthma, but I'm not sure because my Mom could have exaggerated it when describing it to the doctor. Basically, when I was younger I would get coughs for 2 months or more every winter. Not sure what caused it back then but it would happen. It has started to get a lot better since I've been older. I still get coughs that seem to only be triggered by allergies or some sort of cold or virus. (Got a cough when I had Covid that lingered for a little bit)

The coughs I get don't last nearly as long, and the one I got earlier this year from allergies went away completely after I started taking Claritin-D for a few days. The cough has never gotten worse from physical activity, and physical activity has never caused the cough to start. Not sure what it could be as it usually isn't bad enough that it even bothers me. I do cough louder than a lot of other people, though. Also, it feels like it's just a throat tickle and nothing else. Clearing my throat doesn't get rid of the tickle either. Let me know your thoughts."
"My son has finally been diagnosed with asthma or at least they suspect it. Been given the ventolin and the preventer inhaler.

Question though, why has his cough changed from wet and unproductive to dry and bark like which sounds like croup? 

He has a cold at present which is what flared up this cough. He gets a cough most weeks. 

Just trying to understand it as it is not like my asthma."
"Okay, so basically in the past year, running, cycling, skateboarding, etc. have become extremely painful. It has gotten to the point where even if I run 100 meters I feel like I‚Äôm about to die, and I cannot even finish 200 meters without stopping. Maybe two or three years ago I could run a mile in about ten minutes. Not great, but still a lot better than I am now. I‚Äôm 18 years old, about 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 120 pounds, and have a somewhat toned appearance, so it would seem odd for me to be this way simply because I am ‚Äúout of shape.‚Äù I also have exercised regularly for the past several years. But still, every time I run, my chest gets really tight and the feeling spreads to my back, shoulders, and torso. I also get out of breath really easily and have to lay down for a while after I run to stop the pain. My parents refuse to get me tested and think I‚Äôm just being dramatic about being out of shape, but what do you think? Does this sound like exercise induced asthma?"
"I am a final year Product Design student at Bournemouth University and I am looking for any parents to fill out my questionnaire below.

My project is based around reducing asthmatic symptoms in children triggered from chemical based cleaning products. If you know of any parents of asthmatic children, I would be really grateful if you could share the questionnaire to them too!

Your answers will help me gain really useful information and data that will be used to help dictate the direction of my project. Please see the link below:

"i noticed this happens with me every once in a while yesterday unfortunately at walmart i couldnt stop coughing then in the car it kinda got worse breathing wise but for me this is completely a normal thing and has happened to me millions of times . but ive noticed the last two times ive experienced sinus issues the day after , anyone else get this ?"
"To be precise, I've got a very new diagnosis of asthma and I am struggling with being able to brush my teeth in the morning because of sensory issues. Do any of you take your medication at night instead of the morning? Is it possible, without side effects etc? I've learnt that I am much less likely to get overwhelmed with the brushing sensory issues (as well as anything else touch-related) at night rather than in the morning. I'm autistic (recently diagnosed as well) so I know the root cause is there but I've not found a way to get past this. I'll get hold of my doctor as well but I'd like to know how this large community deals with their medications."
"For a bit of background, I developed what many (including myself) assumed to be asthma around a year ago. I have been taking maintenance inhalers and the occasional rescue since then. However, even with consistent use of my maintenance inhaler, I felt like I wasn't even close to my normal baseline- I struggled less, but I was still struggling.

I asked for a methacholine challenge test, which apparently isn't all that common. It was hella expensive, even with insurance, and I had to put $1k down upfront. I was worried I was spending a bunch of money just to be told the same thing ever nurse and pulmonologist I'd seen had told me before.

However, as we were doing the test, my results didn't strongly correlate with asthma. The results aren't in yet, because my pulmonologist still has to take a look at them and analyze them, but the person doing the test with me talked a lot to me about what my plan was if the test rules out asthma. The only answer I could think of is, ""more tests, I guess"".

Guys, I'm just fucking tired of it. I'm tired of dealing with breathlessness from putting away dishes. I'm tired of taking my dog on a walk feeling like a serious chore. I'm tired of the nausea from my heart and lungs overreacting to basic human tasks like stairs and laundry. I hope I paid a shit ton of money just to realize I have asthma because at least then I'd have fucking hope.

Its just so frustrating. I want this to be over."
"Persistent tickling cough. Worse when I do stuff. Lungs feel prickly. Keeping me awake. My blue reliever helps. 

It's not COVID. How I do I know if I've got an ordinary virus making me feel bad or of I'm having an asthma flare up?

I use my Fostair and Montelukast regularly as prescribed."
"I was diagnosed with asthma a little over a year ago. I was having breathlessness that just felt like I wasn‚Äôt getting all the air I breathed into my lungs.

Lately I have had small bouts of breathelessness where I feel like I suffocate or my lungs don‚Äôt work for all of 2 seconds and then my body snaps back to it. I‚Äôm on a daily inhaler and I‚Äôve used my rescue inhaler before when this happens out if precaution, but is this a possible asthma attack or similar to anyone else‚Äôs experience? 

I talked to my asthma doctor and my regular GP and had heart testing and neither were worried but also didn‚Äôt say if it was bc of the asthma and it scares me when it happens."
I know one of the side effects of Symbicort is thrush if you don‚Äôt rinse with water after using it. I just wanted to know if anyone else gets this? It‚Äôs like one tastebud gets inflamed and turns white? It‚Äôs been happening for years.
Do any fellow asthmatics find that even a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù cold always ends up setting in the chest and will almost no doubt take 7/14 days to recover . During which time will  most likely need to be treated with steroids ? Or I am the only oneü•¥. Also does anyone get these 2-5 x a yr give or take. ( i used to only get them 1x a yr but now that I have kids I get them more)

"I joined Reddit just now to ask this question, so forgive me if I'm doing it wrong or if this has been asked before. I've had asthma since I was a kid, but will go long periods without and then it'll come back to the point that I wouldn't dare leave my house without an inhaler. I've been having a horrible flare-up that's been going on for about a month and wasn't improving too much with Flovent (though, admittedly and foolishly, once I started feeling better on it, I stopped taking it, then I got a cold and the asthma came back full force and so I'd only been taking it again for a couple days and the asthma has gotten real, real bad). It peaked last night and I'd say I probably took 25 puffs of albuterol in a couple hours. The albuterol DID work, but it took like 8 puffs initially for any relief and then would start up again within 20 minutes. It finally tapered off and I slept and took two puffs in the middle of the night and was good (though I've needed it all day so far, but it hasn't been as intense). The doctor said that I should have gone to the ER. He took me off Flovent and I just started prednisone today for the first time ever and took my first dose this morning around 9:00. Questions I have:

1. How quick does prednisone work? And a related question: should I prepare myself for a rough night tonight or do you think it'll help me?
2. A buddy of mine has a nebulizer with albuterol he doesn't need, but he's 35 minutes away...is it worth it to go pick it up this afternoon to possibly avoid going to the ER?
3. Do you all think what I explained above is worth a trip to the ER? It was very scary, but I still was able to breathe enough to survive and at no point did it feel like a total medical emergency, or else I would have gone.

I'd obviously love to avoid going to the ER. It's 35 minutes away and we have 4 young kids, so logistically it's not awesome. But I will go if it's the smart thing. I called my doctor and told them what was up and they were like, ""Yeah, if you're having to take more than 4-6 puffs in an hour, then you should go to the ER."" Sorry, lots of questions. I'm not the sort that worries about health stuff a whole lot, but asthma can be scary and last night I was scared."


I have asthma and I‚Äôve been prescribed FLOVENT HFA. it treats asthma for long term but does not treat asthma attacks and flare ups.  My asthma has been flared up for a few weeks now making it a pain in the ass to breath I am also on beta blocker atenolol and apparently it can restrict airways.  I need to know if it‚Äôs safe to take 2 puffs of my albutorol whilst I‚Äôm having a difficulty breathing.
"So my doctor is really frustrating. They won‚Äôt prescribe me a maintenance inhaler. But I‚Äôm using my rescue so much to combat the fact that I don‚Äôt have anything else to help me. But then they say I‚Äôm using the rescue too fast, so they won‚Äôt prescribe me another one. Like wtf? What am I supposed to do? This is the second doctor that has refused me anything. I don‚Äôt smoke, I don‚Äôt do anything to mess up my lungs or my asthma. I have a record of having pretty severe asthma, but they refuse me anything. What am I supposed to do? Just go to the ER or die? Lmfao."
I just switched from syimbicort to zenhale .. fingers crossed for some improvement
My 5 year old has been taking it and after a puff she gets really silly and hyper. When I asked her how it makes her feel she said like eating all the candy. How does it make you feel?
No ventolins neither!! Advair has exterminated my asthma! Of course I stopped I bunch of times cause I‚Äôm so out of shape but no breathing difficulties at all!!! 2 weeks off prednisone that too!
Hey guys new to this page I was told I had asthma at the start of the year was mild I reacted to the histamine test I think they call it but actually gave me reflux and coughed rather than chest pain and shortness of breathe I‚Äôve noticed inhalers don‚Äôt help for chest pressure tightness and the emergency inhaler also doesn‚Äôt relive the chest pain any help or insights? Is actually asthma?
"So my fitbit checks my Spo2 level at night, and last night my range was between 88-96%.. i feel like 88 is very low.. however im not short of breath, i took my inhalers and nose spray as normal last night.. i had a chest xray 2 weeks ago that was normal along with bloods that were normal.. im now scared to sleep :("
"I was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma as a kid but never used an inhaler. I struggle to breathe all the time for the past 15 years and have to breathe deeply through my mouth often. I struggle for breath when talking on the phone, reading out loud etc. Aside from getting an inhaler what are my options? I heard good thinks about Butekyo."
2  pulmonologist said I don't have asthma! They did a kung function test and it was normal..yet I feel like im suffocating and another interesting thing I noticed my CO2 is on the high side and that's an indication of hypercapnia and none of the doctors say anything about it !! I feel so out of breath for every little thing and my oxygen drops before I even knock out !! It drops below 90! What's going on ?!! I need an answer this so frustrating.

"My brother used to have pretty bad asthma when he was a kid but has since grown out of it. He‚Äôs very athletic and doesn‚Äôt have any breathing issues.

We were playing around with my peak flow meter and I noticed that he was wheezing when he blew into the meter, his number was as 490 (same as mine, but he‚Äôs taller and is a man, so I assume it should be higher). 

I suggested trying my albuterol inhaler to see if it makes a difference. His wheeze was gone and he blew 600 afterwards. He also says he felt as if his lungs opened up.

I suggested going to a doctor and getting spirometry testing, but he got defensive saying that he never has breathing issues and there‚Äôs no need to do that (he does lots of endurance training and says he wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that had he had asthma).

Am I freaking out over nothing thinking my brother is walking around with untreated asthma? 

And yes I know I shouldn‚Äôt be giving him albuterol‚Ä¶ but he wanted to try and see."
"I'm on Advair, but Im thinking of dropping to flovent ASAP, because I have heard the LABA can cause heart issues and blood pressure issues."
"Hi everyone 
I was literally diagnosed yesterday with asthma though apparently I had a mild case as a child also.

I‚Äôve used my inhaler a couple of times now and have noticed I‚Äôve started coughing up a lot of phlegm and mucus after taking a puff.
Is that normal? 
I‚Äôve read conflicting things online and not sure what‚Äôs correct"
"Hello all! I am currently conducting a survey into asthma for my university project and would be greatly appreciative if you could fill it in. The research is looking at asthma control and the impact having asthma has on exercising.

"I (F18) had an asthma attack this morning. It was my first and it really freaked me out. I went to the doctors and I managed to overcome it, but now without bursting into tears. My mom was there the entire time and seemed very worried.

My dad on the other hand didnt seem to care. Only gave out to us for making him wait in the car outside the doctors for half an hour (it was my moms appointment that I gatecrashed). The doctor said someone had to keep an eye on me. That fell to my dad as my mom had to work. Every hour she recommended. Ive seen him twice in the last 7 hrs. 

We do have sick cattle atm and I understand that theyre a top priority, but rn Im really struggling again (Im pretty sure Ill have another attack) and I just want someone to be there. 

I rang him and explained and he said that he had to check on sheep and hang out clothes. I asked ""so apparently clothes and a bunch of animals are more important than me?"" Thats when he gave out to me and said not to expect him home for hrs. 

AITA?"
"Im not sure if it was anxiety before exams what, but it was a really scary experience"
"I‚Äôve got severe asthma that is extremely brittle and tends to fall sharply off a cliff very suddenly. One minute I‚Äôm fine, the next‚Ä¶ blue and gasping. 

I have had a shocking run with my Asthma for the past 2 years with 6 long hospitalisations alone this year, and now I‚Äôm feeling like this is only getting worse. I‚Äôve noticed recently my ventolin is not working as quickly. 

I‚Äôm on maximum therapeutic dose for my meds‚Ä¶ Trimbow (LAMA/LABA/ICS), Theophylline, Prednisolone and Azithromycin with Ventolin and Atrovent for flares / burst.  I‚Äôve had an extreme flare for the past three months and finally starting to get on top of it, even very slowly weaning the prednisolone which Is great But seriously? This sucks. I‚Äôve been in Prednisolone for most of this year and I don‚Äôt think I could tolerate going back up to high dose again (I don‚Äôt sleep for weeks from BIG asthma attacks around the clock, let alone the pred insomnia!). I‚Äôve been locked up at home in strict iso most of this year due to immunosuppression and asthma flares, and to top it all off, because I am stuck indoors until I‚Äôve had my third Pfizer dose at a minimum and even then we‚Äôve got no idea how I‚Äôm gonna respond as last time my asthma went nuts after the vaccine and I ended up in hospital for a week. 

I‚Äôm just starting to recover and with back burning : bushfire season approaching, I‚Äôm concerned I‚Äôm going to be back at square 1 all over again. 

My question to those with severe Asthma, at what point did you decide to try Biologics? What‚Äôs your experience? What are the negatives? 

I‚Äôm seeing my specialist in a few weeks time and am thinking about really pushing for this
Even though because of Prednisolone my eosinophil markers will be below cutoff for gov funding because of the high dose pred. 

I just want my life back. Some sense of normal.

Sorry if this is a bit jumbled - I‚Äôve still got pred brain üß†"
"When I was younger I had such a huge asthma attack that it nearly killed me and I was in the hospital for almost 3 weeks and I was breathing through an oxygen mask and tubes and it left such an impact that I couldn't walk. When I came home, I was in bed for another weeks (still one tons of medicine, oxygen) - my parents had to check up on me wearing masks (pre-covid) and eventually I had to take physical therapy to walk normally (I wasn't long - but my condition nearly took me down)"
I was just laying in bed thinking about current asthma treatments and I‚Äôd love to know if you guys think there will ever be a cure in our lifetime? I‚Äôve seen a couple articles about progress that has been made on learning the root cause of asthma and modern medicine is advancing very quickly but I also wonder if maybe this is just one of those things that won‚Äôt be cured for a long LONG time. Just wanted to see what other people think
"Hi everyone,

I'm moving to us next year and I'm trying to figure out how much should I expect to spend with medicine. I use Budesonide / Formoterol on a daily basis to control asthma. I did a quick search and it seems that it retails for $300 each inhaler. That seems a lot. I also use budesonid as a nasal spray to control polyps proliferation. 

My employer gives me the choice to choose from several insurance companies. Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Kaiser and Cigna to name a few.

 Since I'm not familiar with how prescription coverage works, I'd be really happy if someone could give me some tips on which company I should focus on. Should I expect to pay that price even with insurance?

Thank you"
"I don't know if I have asthma, I got really sick two weeks back and I don't know if it was corona. When my mom got carona she got diagnosed with asthma afterwards. I was fine super hyped up, then I got paranoid, really paranoid, then I got a super grim feeling, couldn't breathe, I started getting light headed, a headache, lost balance and got shakes. My mom said it sounded like an asthma atto. I used her inhaler and now I'm fine. Just was it an attack? Could I have asthma? I'm just shaken up.  Advice please."
"Has anyone personally experienced any of the negative mental health side effects from Singulair? It seems to mostly impact children, but I am curious about why the black box warning was never shared with me when I started taking it."
"Does anyone have thoughts on this? Making the switch from an outdoor to an indoor pool for the winter has been brutal. This pool is also only used for competitive and exercise swimming, so it is kept pretty cold which is another trigger. It's getting to the point where it takes me days to recover and not feel absolutely spent after a swim.

I have an inhaler for before exercise use which honestly works great for every other activity but this one. Swimming is a favorite and a huge part of how I manage my mental health. I'm already starting to spiral with it being more difficult, so I'm really worried about this continuing. Any advice appreciated. Insurance chose the perfect time to start acting weird so I'm at a loss on the medical side of things."
"I have had asthma since I was 2, and I've had the same GP my whole life. He was the one who first prescribed me asthma meds, so this is his fault. I am 17, and have been taking the exact same ones my entire life. Never thought anything of it. Until about 8-9 weeks ago when I woke up in the middle of the night with a tight chest. I went to my roommate after 2 hours and he was already awake. He said I had woken up by wheezing, sitting on the sofabed. He got me a glass of water, and said the colour was starting to come back into my lips and cheeks. Suddenly my chest just seized up. It's such a hard feeling to describe. It tenses up, but you can't relax it. He drove me to urgent care, and they just told me over the phone to just go home and have some water. So we did. But it wouldn't get any better. So we went to a&amp;e, and they saw me straight away. I told them I had been to urgent care and the nurse said ""Ok, so they told you to come here.""
Me: ""No they told me to go home and have a glass of water""
Nurse: ""Please don't joke""
Me: ""Oh... I'm... I'm not.""
Nurse: ""Wait. What?""
Me: ""Mhm""
Nurse: ""If you were the same as you are now when you went there, I... I have no words. That's just wrong. What meds are you taking?""
Me: ""Oh, 150mcg clenil modulite 2x a day, ect.""
Nurse: ""150mcg? Are you sure. That's a small child's dose.""
Me: *Hands inhaler*
Nurse: ""Okay... So when was your last asthma review, and who was it with?""
Me: ""Oh, last month with Dr______.""
Nurse: ""I used to work with him. Good job he's had his medical license revoked now though.""
Me: ""Wait. What. Why?""
Nurse: ""I can't say anything apart from malpractice. Sorry... Anyway I won't make you talk any more.""
I recovered well and I got sent home a few hours later. Long story short, my asthma hasn't been the same since, I got told I had a chest infection and that was why I had the attack, I've had covid since and the chest infection hasn't gone away. My inhaler is getting changed and I'm starting on some more, proper asthma meds for my age. Apparently it should have been changed when I was 8. I'm really mad at him."
"Hey everyone! I have an upper respiratory infection and so far not doing too bad‚Ä¶ only on 15mg pred daily and doing well *fingers crossed*. I picked up some menthol cough drops, has anyone here had any issues with menthol products? I understand menthol inhalation can be bad for asthmatics, but I figured in this form of ingestion it would be okay. I‚Äôve had a few so far with no issues but did not know if it would creep up on me."
"asthalin100mcg. How do you differentiate mild asthma vs some type of anxiety behavior? And no my doctor isn't helpful .. 

I understand what the med does and pretty sure I used it correctly,maybe spacer needed?"
"i‚Äôve struggled with asthma since i was about 12 and i‚Äôm 20 now. I use my normal Ventolin inhaler 3-4 times a day (everyday). I have been prescribed the symbicort inhaler a couple of times which is the red one (i live in aus) and it kind of never really helped so i just slowly stopped taking it. I‚Äôve been to the doctors twice a long time ago with issues around my asthma and they just keep giving me symbicort. My old doctor even told me to just use my normal inhaler as I had been but take 4-6 puffs every time i use it which would literally be like 20 a day which is ridiculous. Just wanting to know peoples opinion on what the best inhalers are for treatment before I go back to my doctor for a second opinion, I can‚Äôt imagine that continuing to use my ventolin inhaler multiple times a day can be good for you long term"
"I have mild asthma, it usually doesn‚Äôt bother me on a daily basis, just when my allergies flare up, and when I exercise. It recently got worse with exercise, i ride horses, in an outdoor arena, so it does get dusty especially now in autumn. 
I‚Äôve been really struggling with riding and i have to take regular breaks, and my sessions are much shorter now. 
My dr prescribed singulair, i‚Äôve been taking it for 4 days, and had a ride today. I didn‚Äôt see much improvement in my breathing, but i noticed some changes in my body. After i started to get short of breath, i kept pushing through, but ended up nearly falling, and my body started shaking. It felt like jello, like I didn‚Äôt have enough strength to kick with my legs. i feel weak and a bit shaky, even now 2 hours since the ride. 
is weakness/shakiness a common side effect of singulair? 
I actually felt a bit different since the first pill i took, I didn‚Äôt do any major physical activity until this morning, but i still felt off."
"My friend has asthma and says that using something like budesonid/formeterol in an inhaler for daily use might cause me tremors in the future. She says this kind of treatment is experimental and causes harm in the future since it should only be used for emergencies. 

My doctor prescribed this single inhaler to me and told me to use it daily, use it more when I have the flu and use up to 8 doses if my asthma is severe. 

I have just recently been diagnosed with asthma and a bundle of allergies. I have never had an ""asthma attack"" before. The inhaler has made my breathing significantly better but I want to avoid future complications. 

Does anyone have any resources I could dig into or something (video, text, paper) that could help me understand my asthma better?"
"I just got a new inhaler, of a different brand than my old one. The old one felt like presence in my throat, but didn't taste like anything. The new one tastes sweet, not just in my mouth but also at the top of my windpipe. I've had both sweet and non-sweet inhalers before, and I've never known why the difference was.

My old inhaler is 108 mcg of albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 90 mcg of freebase albuterol) per puff, with HFA-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) as a propellant. The new one is the same dosage, the same HFA-134a propellant, but with some ethanol added. It would seem that the ethanol should be responsible for the difference, but I've smelled hand sanitizer and vodka and bourbon, and I know what alcohol vapor feels like on my mouth and airway, and this is very different."
"I‚Äôm new to all this, her asthma started last winter, went away after taking albuterol for about two weeks. Then the doctors wanted her to start Flovent. She‚Äôs been on it for about 3 months with no albuterol needed. Until, she had a cold about two weeks ago and is still coughing if she doesn‚Äôt take albuterol‚Ä¶ seems like the Flovent isn‚Äôt doing anything if only the albuterol helps. I might be wrong, I have no idea really but wanted to get your guy‚Äôs opinion who have more experience."
"so i‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with asthma and i was wondering if anybody knows of any good products that can help with monitoring blood oxygen while i sleep. i suffer from severe anxiety so even though i know it‚Äôs super unlikely, i‚Äôm constantly in fear of having an asthma attack in my sleep and not waking up. i feel that if i had a bracelet or something that works like an oximeter but makes an alarm to wake me up if my blood oxygen goes below a certain level i‚Äôd be able to sleep much better without fear. has anybody used something similar and would it be worth buying?"
"I don‚Äôt have asthma but I have a blue inhaler from the last time I was really ill which was a few years ago, the inhaler expired 02/2020. I‚Äôve had a nasty chest infection for going on 8 weeks and haven‚Äôt been able to get a doctors appointment. Until I can get it replaced, is it safe to use? I know it wouldn‚Äôt perform to the same standard as if it were in date, but any relief would be welcome. Is it safe to use still?"
"the popular opinion online and in this forum seems to be that baseboard heating is the best type for allergies.

I have terrible asthma when I turn baseboards on. I've even taken them apart, cleaned them out as best as possible, and burned off the residual dust at a high temp with windows open for a few hours- this buys me a few days of comfortable heating before their activity starts making me very sick again, and I must leave myself in the cold once more.

I can't really do the cleaning process every few days- it's time consuming and wastes lots of energy, plus we've covered most windows in plastic insulation since we thought we'd dealt with the problem already.

to add to the confusion, any friend's house or apartment that has forced air (or whatever it's called), gas heating, etc, has been a treat to breathe in, presumably because they have well-maintained filters.

am I crazy?? is there anything else I can do? does it really just take ANOTHER week of burning through the bad gunk? then why was it fine for a brief time? 

I need to move soon, in a state experiencing a housing crisis, and i found a perfect apartment but it has baseboard heaters. ""I'm going to look for a place without baseboards"" sounds like crazy talk from what I've seen online. (plus, most places have them.)

I know I can invest in a space heater or something similar, but other people in a place might use the baseboards in main living spaces, or there might not be per-bedroom thermostats.

sorry for long post: **TLDR** what has been your experience with baseboard heaters and dust allergies?"
Yeah so basically as stated in the title just wondering if it's possible for a smell that isn't artificial at all to aggravate asthma if you have no anxiety about it either. My understanding is chemicals in fragrance is what aggravates asthma or induces anxiety which aggravates asthma. Can anyone tell me if I'm mistaken or confirm I'm correct?
"I have heard of people who switch over personal care, cleaning and air/candle products from synthetic harsh chemicals to natural base products ‚Ä¶ their asthma goes away!

Plus high quality essential oils like Young Living can do wonders for the bronchial tubes ‚Ä¶ peppermint, Eucalyptus, etc"
"Okay, so here's what I'm dealing with. 

Five days ago I had contact with a trigger. The next three days my breathing gradually got worse. On day four my breathing was FUCKED, but I upped my inhaler and used the nebulizer and felt better for the rest of the day, though still worse in the night. Today has been better but I'm still worse for wear, definitely some trouble breathing but I'm getting by, I'm still upping my dose and using the nebulizer.

I don't have a fever and I haven't really been coughing a lot, but the thing bothering me is could all this suffering really be due to a trigger FIVE DAYS ago? Or would it be a safe assumption I have some kind of infection?

It's also been quite windy and rainy and it is spring. First time in like 14 years it's been this bad though."
"I feel paranoid about this sometimes. If I didn't inhaler perfectly or press that button smoothly. I take it with a spacer too, but still, I get paranoid sometimes, when it was not perfect. Idk why. I'm scared my lungs may not have gotten the medicine. I hope Im not alone in this..."
"I‚Äôm 21 years old and recently had trouble breathing las year with chest pain. Covid was the first thing ruled out and after going back and forth with drs and tests and treatment plans I‚Äôve finally been diagnosed with asthma by a pulmonologist. I am on Singulair, Symbicort inhaler and abuterol inhaler all prescribed last year by my primary dr. I feel like my treatment doesn‚Äôt help me much. The pulmonologist said he cannot give me a better treatment plan because I have cats and that‚Äôs a big trigger. I do have pretty bad allergies that I get allergy shots for but cats and dogs are the lowest allergy I have on my allergy test at 0/1. I feel like he saw I was slightly allergic to cats and when I said I do have cats he just rolled with it and wouldn‚Äôt accept any other reasoning he didn‚Äôt even mention my other allergies that are way higher. He said I need to get rid of my cats, lose weight (I‚Äôm 160 and 5‚Äô), and take Prilosec for acid reflux before he will help my asthma. I just feel like my appointment wasn‚Äôt as proactive as I was expecting, I‚Äôm not getting rid of my cats because while I know allergies are asthma triggers I don‚Äôt think my cats are the main allergy reason for mine because I‚Äôve had cats my whole life before all this started and that‚Äôs also my lowest allergy. I also don‚Äôt think my weight is much of an issue either as I don‚Äôt look or feel overweight by any means. I just feel like I‚Äôm now more frustrated and confused than before I seen him. Does this sound normal or should I see about getting a second opinion??"
"I‚Äôm 23m and have had asthma my entire life. I haven‚Äôt had an asthma ATTACK in years, but I also haven‚Äôt been active in years either. I just started going out on runs again today and I could feel my lungs started to sorta close up on me? Like I would be trying to take a deep breath and it would feel like my lungs would just close up for like 0.5-1 seconds at a time every few seconds. 
My question is, what exactly do you recommend for ‚Äúpushing yourself‚Äù? Because I understand that you want to get your heart rate up and sweat but I just don‚Äôt want to be on the ground struggling to breathe and someone comes up to me and ask if I‚Äôm ok after just running up the street. That shit is embarrassing to be honest lol."

"I am a student from the UK working on a product that can replace current chemical based multi surface cleaning products in the house with a product that just requires electricity and water and is completely safe for use. This is because I have found research to suggest that bleaches and sprays can trigger symptoms in children within the home.

"So im living with my grandparents while trying to get on disability (for ptsd caused by abuse, ironically) and im basically restricted to my room for most of the day because ""it doesnt bother me so it must be all in your head."" I have been forced to go to bed several hours before my natural time just to try to get a few hours of broken sleep before the assault begins every morning. I had to put on the carbon filter mask at 5:50am this morning and throw open the windows for air even though its below freezing. I can sort of manage to breathe if i do this. But i cant leave my room to go to the bathroom or make food until the air clears, by which time another trigger is likely to have been put into the air. I have told them how this affects me and asked for simple solutions such as cracking a window or pushing the vent button on the microwave, but have been told ""im not going to live how you want me to."" I am starting to get suicidal. I have nowhere else to go. Is there anything I can do either to breathe or to make them stop triggering my asthma?"

"Well, today I had to leave work early to go to the emergency clinic. I've had asthma since I was a baby, but stopped taking my Albuterol when I was 5-6 years old. I honestly just thought I didn't need it anymore and my parents listened to me lol. 

Fast forward 20 years, I've been struggling to breathe and was too timid to ask for help. Coming from a military family I wanted to appear strong for my family and not have them worry about me. This was not the right way to go about things of course..

Today I honestly could not breathe and had the fear of God in me. Don't be like me. If you need help seek it out, no one will do it for you."
"Hello fellow asthmatians, :)

I want to ask a medical question, I've searching about why Antihistamins don't help, generally, against asthma symptoms. My question is, if Antihistamins don't help, then why on earth would Prednisolone (Glucocorticoid) help me breath again. Could it be that I have seasonal asthma, or as an allergic reaction??! 

Info: I was diagnosed when I was 14 (28 now) of asthma, after a severe bacterial lung infection, and I've been using enhalers (Dosieraerosol, or Salbutamol, and Seretide). I don't always use the enhalers, but in Spring and Autumn,  I can't even breath without them. I only take Prednisolone when my enhalers are empty and I'm waiting for a doctor appointment (like now!). and Sadly, I'm a smoker!!

extra: Should I ask for another diagnosis? and what type of medications you take? it would help since you guys are the only people with asthma I can connect with?"

"I can't tell you how many asthma medications I have ran through that were ineffective for me. I went and took asmanex, that failed. I took wixela, that failed too. I took symbicort, that made my asthma worse and landed me in the emergency. QVAR also doesn't work for me. Montelukast made me super tired and gave me insomnia as well. Tested for eosinophils, didn't have eosinophilic asthma either. My eosinophils were low if anything. Finally, got on advair HFA 230/21 and that controls my asthma so fucking well. I had to also do 3 prednisone courses this summer while I was trying to find an inhaler that worked....

This has been an absolutely rough year for me, but I made it. You will make it too, keep trying :)."
"During my therapy session last week (20f) I realised that so much of my depression and anxiety comes from my asthma. I‚Äôm constantly worried because I just constantly feel like I can‚Äôt breath properly or I‚Äôm heavy breathing because I feel like I can‚Äôt get enough air in. Also the more u read on stuff the more u see ur more likely to have lung disease or lung cancer or chronic lung illnesses or a collapsed lung and it‚Äôs not like hearing any of that makes me feel better üôÑü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. The last time I went to the doctor she said that I have Linear atelectasis which basically means part of my lung is collapsed which DIDNT make my anxiety or breathing any better. Is anyone else with me I just feel like no one listens when I say I can‚Äôt breath properly I take A LOT of medicines (I take alvesco 2 puffs in the morning 2 puffs at night, 1 10mg montelukast, 1 vitamin D, and an allergy pill every night and albuterol as need which is around 2 puffs twice a day for me). I‚Äôm just so done because I‚Äôm taking all the measures possible and I‚Äôm not feel how I should and it frustrates and scares the hell out of me I just want someone to truly listen and find out what is wrong with me. At this point I‚Äôve given up and don‚Äôt know what to do I just try to breath through the pain but at what point will I just feel better? Anybody else feel the same."
"I‚Äôve had a recent bout of shortness of breath over the past week. It‚Äôs gotten so bad that I needed to visit urgent care two times.

So my mom has been coughing violently for months now (every few minutes). Now she‚Äôs wheezing and having issues breathing.

"Hello,

So i went to spirometry and got my results. FEV1 3.51 and FVC 5.71. My FEV1 reversibility was 12% 0.43, but my fev1/fvc went from 0.6 to 0.66. I did PEF for two weeks and i got 13 times more than 15% increase. Is this more like asthma or can that reversibility happen in COPD too? I have pulmonologist appointemnt next week, but im bit stressed out. Any toughts?"
"Hello everybody. I've been experiencing changes in the behavior of my Asthma and was hoping to hear if anybody has experienced something similar and if so, what you were able to do that helped the situation. 

Bit of background, I've had asthma for approximately 5 years now ever since I had a severe reaction to something that ended up giving me incredibly bad chest congestion for about a week. (lungs filled up with mucus, felt like i was drowning, I would lose my breath just getting up out of bed to use the toilet.  I was very unhealthy at the time, but am now quite fit, eat a great deal better (although I've been slacking recently).  For a while cold weather would trigger me, dust (dustmite allergy), grass/weeds (only when in an area where the grass was freshly cut), in a house with cats (cat allergy). For over a year now, I am rarely triggered by these things, and attribute a lot of this to living a healthier lifestyle, as well as incorporating different types of wellness therapies such as regular infrared sauna use and cold exposure (i've developed high cold tolerance, I can be out for hours in freezing temperatures with very light clothing without getting sick or too uncomfortable, absolutely zero  asthma symptoms).

I was starting to feel very hopeful that I'd minimized my asthma to just a minor inconvenience every now and then, however a couple months ago things changed. I've begun having shortness of breath, chest tightness, and mucus production (post nasal) almost every evening, starting around 6-8pm. Sometimes it will be mild enough that i just ignore it, if not one puff of salbutamol will make me comfortable, however the mucus production is still there. What I'd like to know is if anybody else has experience something similar where the only change in the environment seems to be the time of day. I won't have any symptoms all day in my home, but sure enough, evening rolls around and the symptoms come. 

So far, I have tried several things. Since dust had been my most common trigger prior, I looked there first. I run a few hepa air purifiers scheduled daily, no help. I found that the humidity in the house was unsually high (mid 60%), so I now run a couple dehumidifiers daily and the humidity is now 40-45%, no change in symptoms. I thought mold might be the issue as we had a recurring issue in the bathroom (going back to last year), but it was never a trigger prior and since we decreased the humidity we haven't had a problem.

Probably just a coincidence, but I was fine prior to getting my covid 19 vaccine, all this started a month or 2 after. 

Any help or ideas would be amazing, thanks so much in advanced!

TLDR

Asthma is triggering every evening in my home for months now, but no other times of the day. Anybody else?"
"i was prescribed an antibiotic with sulfa, and now i have cough variant asthma. it doesn't seem like many others have this problem, so i'm curious to see if i can find anyone on here."
"I have been taking it for a while now &amp; have gained some weight. I also recently quit smoking. I know losing weight would help me with my asthma but at the same time the medications can cause weight gain. I feel so stuck right now. Has anyone had success with losing weight while on Symbicort? (I also take montelukast, Zyrtec daily, and Flonase nasal spray). I eat like one meal a day, I don‚Äôt think I eat that much to gain weight so I‚Äôm confused everyone else‚Äôs experiences."

"I have had asthma since childhood. To my surprise, it completely disappeared one season, when i was in my mid teens. And it stayed that way for another 3-4 years until recently. I have been facing discomfort since the last 2 weeks. 
Does asthma return this soon? I have heard that people who have it since childhood, usually encounter it again in their 30s or 40s, but not so soon.
I contracted covid 19 earlier this year, and since then I have had a bit of cough every now and then, but it was nothing like the typical asthma cough. 
I am thinking Covid might have triggered my asthma. Could this be the case?"
"I had a horribly bad attack yesterday I have severe asthma meaning it's not controlled with drugs. The worst I've ever had. I was doing sound recording on set next to a bonfire.

I thought I was dying I was terrified. I asked the people around me to call an ambulance. The responder said the wait time was 40 minutes! I figured at that point I'd be waiting in excess of 2 hours.  After an hour I asked the people around me to call off the ambulance and 999 delightfully agreed meaning they hadn't even sent one out.

So my question: Are they expecting me to have a serious asthma attack for that long? Because if I was at the same intensity I know I'd be dead by now. 

Should I have let the ambulance come, what would they have done if I was not having as bad of an attack as I was when they were called.

This is not to say my asthmatic event was finished by the time I asked them to call it off- it was just at a slightly worse than normal level.

I've always been really disappointed in the care I've received from the NHS but this was horrible."
"Hi guys, i need help because the situation is getting worse and worse every day. I can't go to the hospital because of the area i live in - the hospital is for covid patients only. I have many allergies - dust, food and animals. I have 4 cats, they live outside and I'm allergic to them - i start sneezing, my eyes start itching and the worst one is that i can't breathe. I've been like that for 5 days straight and my parents didn't believe me so i didn't go to the hospital and, eventually, it was asthma caused from allergies. I'm allergic to Ventolin and i don't know what to use to get better. What inhaler do you guys use?"
"I've had asthma since birth according to my ma. It sucks too. You know how many times I wished I could have ran with the other kids without my lungs trying to pretend they don't know what oxygen is. 
Sleepless nights because it feels like Fat Albert has decided to use my chest a his personal arm chair.  
Or weirdo people telling you because I used an emergency inhaler to stop an asthma attack means... I'm.... faking it?? Idiots.... smh 
Anyway, I'm just mad because I stopped breathing in my sleep, woke to an asthma attack at 3 a.m. and spent an hour looking for my inhaler thinking,  ""why can't you be normal, body?!?!"" And gasping for air.  
I found it though....under my pillow.... just a little angry at my body right now."
"It's always been said that I'm full of hot air, but it's the literal truth too - I can routinely plink the top of my meter when I'm not having an attack, to the point that if I'm blowing 700 I might go ""hmmm."" 600 would be dire concern. So, I've not had a truly accurate measure of my PFR in a long time - only the knowledge that it's a lot. Thus, the question. Partly for health concerns, partly because I wanna know how hard I can really blow."
"You all have really helped me through a very dark phase in my life, and the collective asthmatic ear has helped me much more than you all realize. I really appreciate all of you for helping me when I was low. I think this basically concludes my asthma journey, however I will probably still continue lurking here for a bit lol."

"Jesus Christ it's been a terrible 3 days. It's so up and down, then I'm breathing okay, then suddenly it's very close to covid territory. And my inhaler is providing limited relief. Spring sucks. And I'm never picking up a cat ever again. Today was decent until about 6 pm."
"I was exposed to an irritant gas about 7 weeks ago, and I‚Äôve been having SOB and chest tightness that flares up sometimes. I never wheeze when I have these flare ups, I just feel like I can‚Äôt breathe and go into a panic that causes everything to go numb. I‚Äôve been to the ER twice because of this and they just say everything looks normal. After the episodes I produce a lot of mucus that‚Äôs green/yellow and sometimes tinged with blood. 

The pulmonologist said my peak flow rate was lower than normal but I responded to albuterol. He said it looks like RADS, and gave me a breztri aerosphere inhaler which seems to be helping a little bit. 

All of this has taken a huge toll on my mental health. I feel helpless, anxious, and depressed. I guess I‚Äôm just confused more than anything. Is RADS asthma? Will it ever go away? Has anyone had a similar experience?"
How were people getting multiple boxes of inhalers? I use proair and some months I go through one or I let it sit for two months. Was wondering where and how people were able to stock up on multiple inhalers.


"I never took a inhailer before this one. I went undiagnosed for 3 years. Essentially I went from 50 miles of cycling and 4-5 hours of yoga weekly down to zero in a month. No specialist helped until I went to an asthma center.

They said I‚Äôm not exhaling all the carbon monoxide. So I couldn‚Äôt even walk a flight of steps without feeling dizzy for 1-2 minutes.

Fast forward to breo. In under a week I rode a bike for 12 miles without a care over 2 hours. I‚Äôm digging up small trees and doing power squats with the trunks. What I was told was anxiety stress has gone away.

However I‚Äôm still only 1/10th of my previous self. Any burst of energy over 1 minute hits me hard and fast. Like very dizzy and losing color in vision. It also stops after a minute of rest. For example I walked up the stairs and grand central this week quickly to the Apple store and nearly feel over.

Three problems:

I now have a heavy deep cough 6-12 times a day.

I get build up of mucus in my throat often.

I still have minimal bursts of energy available.

The doctor said - that just needs its working. It‚Äôs been 45 days already.

About me: now 40, 6‚Äô1 180lbs no smoking or drinking. Good sleep. Pushing slowly for more cardio, weights, and yoga. Above average diet. 

Is this normal with breo?"
"My grandma passed and we recently discovered so many boxes of albuterol that expired in 2018. I‚Äôve heard albuterol doesn‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúgo bad‚Äù and I‚Äôve had a pharmacist tell me that if it‚Äôs not cloudy, it‚Äôs okay. But has anyone heard anything different and should I just throw them out? Thanks."
"Hey guys,

as the headline already stated I'm looking for a metal inhaler frankly because i would like to reduse the amount of plastics in my daily live. Does anyone of you know if there even are metal aftermarket/custom inhalers?"
"im just trying to understand. when i go to sleep my throat somehow seems to reduce the space to allow the air flowing as usual, so i finish having asthma.

i tried as well Ventolin for this, and it works, seems to reduce the inflamation in my throat. 

the question is why this inflamation (or kind of) happen?

someone around with the same issue or with a solution?"

"I‚Äôve heard people go out to Canada/Mexico for insulin and other meds. Has anyone got any rescues/maintenance inhalers from either country? If so, which country and what was your experience? My insurance is sort of in limbo at least for the next couple weeks and I am in desperate need of affordable meds. Thanks in advance."
"Hello, I left my nebulizer at work with no one i can get ahold of, don't have an inhaler and the pharmacy is closed... but I do have a whole bunch of albuterol solution... anyone know of a way I can use it in a pinch? Normally I wouldn't worry too much but unfortunately just ended up in the ER a couple days ago due to my asthma so just trying to have a backup plan. Thanks"
"At first my doctor thought I was anxious. Because I would panic as I experience random spell of shortness of breath, plus constant chest tightness, they especially happen at night, when I lie down and it gets so bad that I woke up breathless a few times (scary experience).  But my oxymeter reading is always 98% sometimes 96%, when I get these ""attacks"", I start to hyperventilating and it can go up to 99%. Now after some blood work I found out I am allergic to something. But I don't know what. I'm waiting for a lung function test (I need to wait a few weeks) meanwhile the doctor gave me the inhaler and the medication as we wait for me to get tested.. but I wonder..  is it even safe to take it if it's not ashtma..? And should I take it with a high sat%?  They gave me salbutamol"
"Dang it. It finally happened. Oral freaking thrush.  After a cold that led to a chest infection, to antibiotics, to a 9 day prednisone taper, it happened.  IT IS SO GROSS!!!  Now on to Diflucan to treat the thrush and my lung doc on Monday.  Yay me!  Any tips for preventing it in the future or did I just have a bad snowball effect?"
"2 years and 3 doctors later, I finally  got a doctor to listen to me. 

When I was a child I had pretty easy asthma, it was mostly athletically induced, I was on advair and an albuterol inhaler. But by the time I was 17,  it has subsided enough that I didn't even need medication. 

In the fall of 2019, I got super sick and this illness brought the asthma back with a vengeance. I had moved across the country to Florida, so whole new doctors then what I was used to. 

I put up with the struggle for weeks before going in. I explained that as a child I had asthma, and that I'd had gone away, but the illness seemed to bring it back. Because my father had died 8 months before,she said it was panic attacks and that it couldn't be asthma because asthma doesn't go away. I also don't always wheeze, but it's like my lungs just won't expand. She saidnshe couldn't hear any wheezing. So she referred me to a grief therapist and gave me an albuterol inhaler since I kept complaining, but she didn't think I needed it. So I did grief therapy for 7 months, it didn't help.

 During that time when it got really bad I would go to urgent care and they would say it was bronchitis and give me prednisone and an inhaler refil. The prednisone would have an effect work for about a month. I'd try to wait it out for another few weeks after the struggle started coming back then I'd go back to urgent care.my primary said I needed to focus on the therapy. 

I gave up after 7 months and went to another primary. I explained the childhood asthma, and the grief therapy wasn't working. This doctor decided it was my heart since my heart rate was elevated. So he referred me to a cardiologist. I had so many heart tests taken. I had a monitor attached for a few weeks, stress tests, eggs. At the end of it all, the cardiologist said he wasn't even sure why the primary wanted so many tests ordered. It all turned out normal.

So after a few months of that, I went to a doctor one of my coworkers recommended. He was great. He actually listened and believed me. He couldn't hear too much wheezing but he could tell I couldn't take very deep breaths. And the the urgent care's prednisone actually helped. He started me on some control medications while getting me a referral to a pulmonologist. 
My insurance wouldn't cover it without a referral. And the previous had been unwilling.
It took a few tries but we finally found a medication that works.

I wish I had found him 2 years earlier. And I wish the other doctors had believed me."
"Anyone else get sharp pains in their chest? I get them after physical exertion (ex. just now literally ran about 50 feet outside in the cold) whenever I inhale. It‚Äôs not super severe, just a little bit more than annoying, maybe a 4/10. They went away quickly. Anyone else or is this something different? FWIW my main triggers are exercise and cold or very hot weather (mostly cold)."
Picked up the cat. Currently on day 2 of suffering. Trying to convince myself it's not pneumonia.
"Just curious, I don't need any solutions or anything. I used to have some type of asthma as a kid, like maybe viral induced asthma or something? I'm 18 now and I can't remember honestly but I used to take medication for it and had a nebulizer. It got worse when I got into my teenager years and It developed into severe asthma, viral induced asthma, a mild form of exercise induced asthma, laughter induced asthma and the type of asthma that's triggered when I breathe in cigarette smoke for too long. Now here comes the brutal part. Asthma medication doesn't work anymore because i've devoped severe asthma. But the the truth is, is that I feel like i'm better off without the medication either way. Now when I get sick my severe asthma and viral induced asthma comes into play just from a cold. I've gotten used to the suffering and I can even walk around for a while even though it feels like i'm about to pass out along with the feelings of the last stages of cancer. I bet that I look like a really slow zombie with a weird walking gait and wheezing sounds as loud as a squeaky toy lmao. But generally I'm asleep all day for a week untill the asthma attack stops and only wake up to use the bathroom. I don't eat for a week when I'm sick because it's so painful to swallow food that it's compareable to eating glass. On rare occasions the cold will develop into pneumonia and eventually I start coughing up blood. Pneumonia will have me bed ridden for two weeks straight with an asthma attack and one time I had the flu and hacked (puked or whatever normal people call it) once. There are times when I've actually thought about suicide because of the pain and agony of having an asthma attack for so long. Honestly the only thing I can do when I get sick is to sleep all day until I wake up, and then go back to sleep until a week or two is over depending on if it developes into pneumonia or not. As mentioned before medication doesn't work. Not even high dosages of anything will work. I apparently can't die from my asthma  attacks and I don't need medecine to not die lmao. I guess I just really wanted to post this to see if anyone could relate."
"Hello! I‚Äôm 43/f and I have eosinophilic asthma, which came out of nowhere last year. This happened 3 weeks before going into respiratory failure and being vented in the ICU, and in hindsight it is so ominous. I am wondering if anyone else has had anything like this experience.

By December of last year I‚Äôd had a mystery asthma-like illness for six months, and was pretty bad.  I was outside of my home when I had an asthma attack, and Ventolin was holding it at bay (although I was using too much of it, I‚Äôm sure). Both of my inhalers ran out at the same time, and I still had two blocks to get home. On a main road, in the dark, at rush hour, with my 4-year-old, of course.  *Rapidly it got to the point where my child‚Äôs light bag felt too much to carry, and EACH STEP I took it felt like someone was stepping on a hose, and extinguished the little oxygen I could get.*.  This I had never experienced before, and it was terrifying.  

I ended up calling 911, because I was not going to make it home.  I could only speak in syllables, so it took ages to say I needed an ambulance, the city and crossroads I was at. The ambulance got there quickly though,  and with ventolin I could speak and walk. They drove us home, and I took about 20 puffs of Ventolin. They wanted to take me to the ER but I said they‚Äôd just give me prednisone, which I had at home‚Ä¶plus they‚Äôd think it was Covid, which of course kept happening.

But once I stepped out of the ambulance, the hose-being-stepped-on feeling returned. I could hardly make it into our condo. I took prednisone and it didn‚Äôt work for about 4 hours, and even then didn‚Äôt work that great.  

The next week I was diagnosed with e-asthma, I got the Nucala, it was the week before Xmas so I couldn‚Äôt get the required teaching, and I went into respiratory failure in the hallway with the Nucala still in the fridge.  I am still haunted by this.

Has anyone else experienced anything like your oxygen supply being snuffed out with each step you took?"
I know this isn't a health anxiety subreddit but my mental health has been bad and I just need someone who's been there to remind me that I won't die from missing one dose. I'm at risk for an overdose so risking taking a double dose is not an option for me.
"I got some x rays of my lungs because of some problems I was having and my doctor told me everything was OK but that my lungs were larger than normal because of asthma and didn't elaborate. So, is it normal? Does anyone also have big lungs? Should I be worried?"
"I‚Äôm new to this asthma world as my 5 year old daughter likely has it. She is sick right now with a cold and last night before bed I gave her albuterol. After laying down for about 15 minutes she woke up coughing and proceeded to throw up about 5 times. I gave her two more puffs of albuterol as she can have up to 4 and I only gave her 2 the first time. 

She wouldn‚Äôt stop coughing. I made her some tea and put a little CBD in it. She drank about half the tea, laid down and slept through the night. This is what I use to give her before she was given Flovent and albuterol. 

My questions: why did tea and CBD stop her cough while albuterol didn‚Äôt? Have any of you tried CBD to treat asthma and has success? How do you get though asthma while fighting a cold?"

The cold has come on so quickly and I‚Äôm wheezing up a storm. Can barely go outside without needing my rescue. Any tips?
"So I'm taking Bricanyl. It's the one with the counter that you rotate twice. So, you know how you hear the click during the rotation process? Does it matter if you hear the click on the first or second rotation? I've searched all over and can't find anything about it. Usually, I hear it on the second rotation. Now I hear it on the first. Am I still getting my dose?"
"Hi all,

I've been given a peak flow meter in order to keep a diary. I average 420 but it ranges from 300 to 500. Before I started having chest problems I was blowing 650. (I know this as we get tested at work) 

I was previously quite fit and I still do my best to run though I now struggle. Wheezing, coughing, feeling like I've got a band round me chest, if I push through it I start to get black creeping in around the edges of my eyes. If I push it after that it I fall over.

Other things that set me off coughing / chest tightness are smoke, spices, cold air, aerosols, some cleaning products and purfumes. 


My question is, is it possible to have asthma and a decent peak flow reading?

TIA"
"Hey wheezy pals,

Just feeling sad. I am kind of in a lonely stage of life and wish I could have a furry friend to hang out with in the evenings. But with the way my asthma's been, that's looking less and less possible, ever. It just makes me sad because I'd love a dog. Heck, I'd go for a cat, rabbit, hamster, anything really. But all of the above make my asthma flare up. 

Just wanted to cry-rant to peeps who might get it."

"I want to get the flu shot this year, but I‚Äôve never got it before, because my parents think that if I get the flu shot, it will worsen my asthma severity. Is this true? Will I need more strong asthma medicine if I get the flu shot? I don‚Äôt want to if that‚Äôs the case‚Ä¶. The shots are free though. 

Also, I‚Äôm allergic to eggs, is the shot safe still?"
"I've heard fo this with amphetamine, but what about ritalin? It seems to help for me, unintentionally of course. I take 5-10mg instant release daily usually around the afternoon. Today I worked really hard and long hours and my chest was feeling pretty tight. Ritalin completely removed that.

Just curious if others have had this experience with ritalin in particular. I figure it should have bronchodialating quailties since it speeds up the heart."
"Hi there, my 18mo son was just discharged after a three day hospital stay (partially in the PICU on a BIPAP) due to asthma exacerbation caused by bronchiolitis. This is the second time this month he‚Äôs been hospitalized and even after the first stay when I tried to tell them it seems more asthmatic, he was just barely treated with albuterol and Flovent with an oral steroid this time around. I guess I‚Äôm just here because I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm not an asthmatic and they tell me once he starts getting sick give him his inhalers, but I guess I‚Äôm just here for general advice on how to care for a severely asthmatic toddler. I‚Äôm so new to this and it is so terrifying to me that my sons lungs aren‚Äôt working like they should. Thanks."
"As I said in the title I stopped my preventer inhaler last November even when I shouldn't have. I was on relvar (breo in the US) and I stopped cold turkey as I both didn't like the shakiness it gave me and I suffer from ADHD and depression so I never ordered more or asked for a different one.
Ive finally made a new appointment with my asthma nurse as ive been coughing non stop and struggling with flare ups regularly. 
I'm just kind of scared to tell her I took myself off it and unsure of what to ask. Just looking for some support and advice.
I guess I'll just tell her I know I shouldn't have taken myself off and I'd like to start without the LABA as that was making me shaky. I just don't want to be scolded cause I know I shouldn't have taken myself off but I guess that's partly why I haven't asked to be put back on yet.
If anyone can offer some things I should say or ask or just any support please do! I'm just your classic scared uni student who's accidentally neglected their health and trying to sort it!
Thanks"
"My son has been diagnosed with asthma for about a year. Being in preschool, he comes home with a new cold/virus about once a month which flares up his asthma. We treat with nebulized albuterol and a Flovent inhaler, however his breathing becomes labored enough over a few days that our pediatrician sends us to the ER almost every time. Does anybody have advice for preventative care, avoiding expensive ER visits, etc??"
i have no idea what is going on but this is the 3rd time this year im having trouble . 2017 was the only year i was really sick ( seasonal and province change ) but its honestly since i been extremely stressed plus having my 2nd covid vaccine ( pfizer ) its just all gotten worse and easily more triggered . i understand stress can play a huge roll in any medical condition but if anyone else has experienced something similar let me know
"So update to my post from last week, I finally got an appointment with a doctor but unfortunately it was over the phone. 

He told me it was congestion, and prescribed me a medical nose spray and orange and blue puffers, along with ear drops.

I then asked him if I could take over the counter cold medication and he said it was fine.

But I swear, aren‚Äôt asthmatics not supposed to take certain drugs such as DayQuil or NyQuil bc it produces histamine responses? I have no idea how any of that works."
"Currently a college student taking online courses from home this semester. However, next semester I have to go back to campus for in-person classes, but I do not feel safe as I‚Äôm scared of getting Covid since I have asthma. Do you think it‚Äôs possible to my university‚Äôs approval to stay home and take the courses online? Thank you, as I‚Äôm struggling to decide how to go about this issue."

"Its november in Georgia, its just now getting  into the high 60's low 40's days and my lungs are not happy with it at all, my trelegys been working better and im in the process of  getting put on xolair but now im on my first steroid pack of the winter, shot in my butt and 6 days of hell, ive been on prednisone many many times and thought it was time to give methylprednisone a try... BIG mistake, ill take the shakes and chills of prednisone over this any day. I feel absolutly insane and 10000x more emotional and its only day 1, and my stomach is on fire i can barely eat. this is for sure a no go for me haha. hoping this is just a fluke and the whole winter wont be like this but... knock on wood haha, anyone else in hell yet?"
"My bf doesn't have insurance and was prescribed an inhaler. If forget the name but it is a one you use long term and ended in -Cort. Like fizocort it sounded like lol. But anyway, it would cost $121. Is that normal or is the pharmacy overpriced possible?"
I know I post here a lot but does anyone know if it‚Äôs normal to have to take two levalbuterol puffs in the morning and two at night bc I can‚Äôt get a full breath before them. Kinda nervous bc I don‚Äôt know asthma n if it‚Äôs serious or I can better my condition somehow but I need a single puff in the afternoon sometimes
"I doubt anyone here can help me but I honestly don't know what else to do. I've had a chronic, dry, unproductive, cough since March and I'm not getting anywhere with my doctors. In addition to just coughing all the time I sing, laugh too hard, take a shower or even cry without coughing fits that leave me gagging and gasping for air. Initially they tested me for Covid and it was negative. Then my primary care doctor thought it was seasonal allergies and tried a couple of new different allergy medications (I'd been on Zyrtec for years). When that didn't work he started trying inhalers because I had asthma as a kid (I'm 29 now). I tried Brio, Symbicort, Advair, and Flovent. Flovent helped somewhat at least, I wasn't collapsing on my bathroom floor every time I took a shower anymore, but nothing got rid of it.

After trying all that I was sent to get a pulmonologist and had a pulmonary function test and a chest x-ray. I was told both came back normal but my copy of the PFT says COPD as a diagnosis. The best I got from the pulmonologist was that my lungs do struggle to get a full deep breath of air but that's because of my weight and wouldn't explain why this started up in March, considering I haven't had any changes in my weight. He felt really bad but he just didn't have any answers or guidance for where I should go next. Just that my lungs are relatively fine so there's nothing he can do. My weight, and why I can't seem to lose it, is a whole nother long complicated story but suffice to say I work out 6 days a week and eat better than any patient my other 4 doctors I've seen about my weight have seen so I really don't think that's it, and neither did my pulmonologist, he was just obligated to mention that. Like I said, I doubt I'll find answers or any kind of direction here but it's worth a shot.

Here are my PFT results in case anyone wants to see them: http://imgur.com/a/Xhh0YlV"
"Two days I did a spring clean. In fact it was less than two days ago - about 36 hours. And already there is a layer of dust cover the TV unit and window sills. I sleep with the window cracked about an inch wide (if that has any impact?). The room is spotless otherwise. I vacuum the floor every day (because of my severe eczema/dry skin) and the room is neat and uncluttered. 

Any tips on how to reduce levels of dust or why I get so much dust in this room would be appreciated."

Really need your guys help. I have been suffering from this unnamed problem for years now. It usually hits from October when the cold season kicks in. I have a big wheeze and feel like i‚Äôm constantly tight in my chest and out of breath. Ive been to the doctors 5+ times and they tell me it isn‚Äôt asthma but at this point I honestly don‚Äôt know what to believe because this is ruining me. Any advice is appreciated &lt;3
"I'm new to asthma stuff and so confused. I have doctor visits scheduled but they're weeks out and I come back from some of them with more questions than answers.

1. Most days, I'm fine
2. Sometimes I get a cold, then I'm fine. And then two weeks after the cold is over, I start wheezing and get put on prednisone at urgent care. Eventually the wheezing stops by the end of the prednisone.
3. I've been fine for the last few weeks. Then two days ago I started wheezing and every day it's a little worse. It goes up and down though. Sometimes even seems to change  just based on what room I'm in. But also doesn't seem to go all the way away.
4. Unless I'm bad enough to be on the prednisone, my peak flow meter thing is maxed out when I use it to check myself.
5. I have bad seasonal, pet, etc allergies and bad reactions to most allergy meds. I'm on Azelastine and Montelukast which seem to clear up most things. Except the wheezing.
6. They did a breathing test spiro thing and said the rescue inhaler doesn't really help my lungs. So they're not sure if I have asthma. But I was like 80% where I should be. So they ordered another test and I have to do it again.

I feel like I don't know when it's OK for me to breathe and when it's not. Anyone else go through something like this? Should I be doing something different? What am I missing?"

In this year 2020 i was prescribed the Dulera inhaler and honestly its worked wonders i used to go up to a month without using my Albuterol rescue inhaler and its heleped a whole lot. Mid october i went to thr doctors office for a asthma check up and they said im still doing good and i can honestly say that the Dulera is the reason. I got my rescue inhaler and dulera refilled. When i went to the pharmacy they only gave me the rescue inhaler not the dulera they said it was because they were out at that time wich i thought nothing of it. Today when i went to check if it was restocked they said the Dulera was no longer available for medical use and ive looked online to see what the issue was and could not find anything. Does anyone here know what perhaps might be going on?
"Hi all, I (34F) got my first inhaler (albuterol/ProAir HCA) last week after an apparent upper respiratory infection and it has been a big help! The dr said my lungs and chest X-ray were clear, no Covid either, so they think I am having asthma symptoms (I was having coughing/wheezing fits) from the infection as well as my usual hay fever.  I have a few questions, though: 

Is it possible I‚Äôm having allergy-induced asthma? How do I get tested for this‚Äîshould I speak to my ENT or someone else? Any idea if a dr prescribe a maintenance inhaler as well? 

Background: I have had hay fever for years, been on lots of different meds until finding one that works (fexofenadine) and have been taking weekly allergy shots for a while, although not in the past 3 weeks.  I also have GERD that is controlled well by meds. I have never been screened for asthma beyond what is done for a usual physical because my lungs have always seemed fine, especially since I sing a lot, although I have noticed if I ever have a cough it seems to stick around longer than normal. 

This all started when I was having coughing/wheezing fits for no apparent reason and it kind of scared me‚Äîthe inhaler is really helping and I‚Äôm realizing I may have had symptoms for a while but had just dismissed them as normal! I‚Äôm just curious about what the next steps would be."
"I am using Symbicort for 5-6 years now and I haven't had serious asthma issues. I get some daily wet cough but other than that nothing serious.

I recently went to my new family doctor and she recommended me Relvar ellipta 184. She told me it's almost the same thing as Symbicort but apparaently there is something better than it. She also mentioned that the way you are breathing in the powder is much better and covers your lungs better. Plus I will take it only once a day.

Has anyone changed from symbicort to relvar? I am worried about side effect because I have switched once before I used Symbicort to Foster and had tremors. I used Flixotide when I was a kid, but then I changed to Pulmicort because I wasn't having much success with Flixotide"
"Ive been on the same Flovent/Ventolin pairing for over ten years, Montelukast was added five year ago. 

My asthma started in childhood and was barley a problem, now in my 30s im hitting my Ventolin everyday and being put on short courses of prednisone a few times a year. 

My doctor just swapped me to Zenhale/Ventolin/Rupall and I was wondering if anyone had any insights on these? 

I understand that Zenhale is a corticosteroid paired with a long-acting beta-agonist, and that Rupall is an antihistamine. Montelukast is a leukotriene antagonist‚Ä¶my doctor didn‚Äôt explain why an antihistamine was better than that? Does anyone know why she might have decided this?

Thanks very much."
"Guys, how often do you have attacks, lets say in a year?
And how long these attacks last? What do you usually do, when you have them?

I have attack every other month or so, maybe even every month and i am sick of it. And this is after changing my medicaments."
"My daughter has been on Flovent for 3 months. She coughed for 5 months before her doctor prescribed albuterol. She took albuterol for a week and a half and her cough went away. Then the doctor prescribed Flovent. Her cough has stayed away but now she is sick and coughing. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know if the Flovent is helping. I don‚Äôt want to keep giving it to her if it weakens her immune system and prolongs her sickness and is still coughing while taking it. 

It seems all drugs have major side effects and I just don‚Äôt know what is best. Getting some opinions from people who have asthma would be helpful. She also hasn‚Äôt been diagnosed with asthma as she wasn‚Äôt able to perform the pft well enough, but from what she did do they don‚Äôt think her asthma is severe"

Hello reddit, Iam possibly getting asthma diagnosis soon here are my symptoms I have Digs syndrome and my chest and vocal chords hurt, I cough alot and I have been spitting up alot more mucus. It also hurts to breath and sleeping sucks. What do you think ?"
Levalbuterol not working after post nasal drip what can I do Allegra kinda helped but can‚Äôt get a full breath do I need a nebulizer treatment please message
My lungs have always been shit. I was born with hyaline membrane disease as a premee. Loved on oxygen for the first like 3 years of my life. Nebulizers and inhalers were more normal to me than playing. A few years back my pulmonologist said that my lower left lobe has just stopped working and that I‚Äôll need a partial lobe transplant eventually. I‚Äôm just sitting in bed wheezing with my inhaler hating it all. I hate the mucus plugs. The nebs. The blood. The looks people give me. Making sure I have an inhaler plus an extra. I hate it all. I‚Äôm so physically and mentally exhausted.
The last 2 days my asthma has been awful. Ive used my albuterol inhaler several times today but it only gave me relief for about an hour. I took a Desloratadine 5mg at 6am and now it's almost 11pm and I'm wondering if it would be okay to take another? It says one a day but I feel like my lungs are so tight and I can't get a deep breath. It's making me panic and I'm not sure what to do. My doctor appointment isn't for another day and a half. Can someone give me some advice?

I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs due to constantly swallowing access mucus in my throat especially cause I don‚Äôt always have time to keep blowing my nose at work"
"Today, I may not be here typing on this keyboard if it wasn't for the SCIENTIST, David Jack, who saved my life when he discovered fluticasone... No other asthma medicine works for me... When everyone gave up on us asthmatics, when naturopaths and homeopaths and Ayurveda were trying to scam us, when people were trying to sell us snake oils and magic herbs, David Jack made a drug, fluticasone and salbutamol, of which, if these two drugs were not made, I would have been dead by now. I owe this post to the science and I'm forever grateful and indebted to David Jack.

The reason I keep emphasizing the word SCIENCE so much, is because you don't know how many people in my Indian family tried to convince me to use ""nAtUrAl aYuRvEdIc"" techniques to ""cure"" my asthma. It honestly frustrates me so much. I am a huge martyr for science, and I would do anything for science, because science is what gave me my life, I owe everything to it... Not some 7000 year old religious bullshit..."

"I'm not sure how or when they got in. I'm just happy that I decided to wash my inhaler before using it.

Last night I woke up feeling a bit wheezy, so I used my inhaler. It was so late that I decided not to wash it out after using it. I just put it in my bureau. Today, I'm still feeling a bit iffy so I was going to use it. I run it under some water and I notice a big seemingly fly out. I decided to dismantle the inhaler and... There's a bug right on it. No, that wasn't a mistake.

Ew. I always threw out the inhaler, but I decided to just wash it out. I just hope this hasn't happened before.

I'm not sure how bugs got into it. They were tiny bugs, not like roaches. I assume they were on/in my furniture and got on through an opening. I only just moved my inhaler into the bureau, so hopefully they only got in last night.

I always wash my inhaler by washing the ""inhale"" part with warm tap water. Maybe you're supposed to use soap or you're supposed to wash the entire inhaler, but no one ever told me that."
"Hi, 
I've had life time asthma (on flutiform in morning evening and salbutemol incase of emergency)  Recently recently I've been finding in the evenings I need to focus on breathing as my breaths go quite shallow and sometimes when I'm falling a sleep I feel like I forget to breath if that makes sense, feels better when I'm lying on my side. When I wake up too I have shallow breathing then during the day it eases off and about an hour after waking up, taking my flutiform and getting up and moving I am fine. 
Should note I find it easier to breath in cold weather and going into a cold ro.helpa with my breathing. Me and my partner have also just gotten guinea pigs but I don't think it's effected me that much, we sleep in a separate room for them but this evening breathing started around the same time as we got them. 
Has anyone else experienced this ?"
"I'm pretty new to asthma, since I got it from secondhand smoking.

Lately, I've been coughing at night, especially when there's a fan pointed at me. Though, even when there isn't one, I'm coughing. My guess was it's from the cold, but I'm also very out of shape because I had surgery a few months ago.

Ideas?

I'll be bringing it up to my doctor regardless but I was curious if this sub had answers."
"I was diagnosed with asthma a long time ago . i was referred to a specialist and they did allergy tests as well as the spirometer test . i do have allergies to pets , dust and pillow feathers , i think theres more but i was really young i cant remember . also my specialist said there was air way inflammation and the number was lower beneath than what he wanted to see ( it was under healthy range )  also my symptoms were almost all the time but not everyday but at least 4x a week but worse at night or if i had the flu or cold . with a cold it was a cough that never went away . i was put on advair 125 as well as nasel spray and an allergy pill ( im on new meds now ) over the years its gotten better but still tends to get bad sometimes , this idk what happened. so im wondering , what kind/type of asthma would i have and how bad is it classed as from the sounds of it ? My concerns are carona , and the up coming winter since my symptoms have been worse lately"
I am worried only bc the coughing just wont stop even with the neb.  Most of the time were doing back to back treatments.  The fevers really worry me. Does anyone else experience fevers along with coughing fits?
"I am maybe new to asthma but not sure. When covid happened I started having trouble breathing but it didn‚Äôt seem covid related. I had no fever, no cough, etc. so my doctor virtually saw me and said she thinks asthma. I had an allergy test done like 6 years ago because I was allergic to cats and over time my cat allergies got worse. During my allergy test I found out I‚Äôm also slightly allergic to dogs which I‚Äôve never had a problem with as well as grass, trees, and ragweed (surprising to me because I played soccer my whole life never any issues) and also allergic to mold, cockroaches and very allergic to dust mites. When I started having trouble breathing in the spring of 2020 it was the first time I had lived in a new city so I thought maybe it was that. I got a rescue inhaler which was barely working and then got on an asthma pill which was a relief after a few days or taking it. Then I stopped taking it when spring was over and I was fine. Then this spring comes around and I started having trouble breathing again so I get back on the pill and I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs because of pollen. Once on the pill everything was fine. Then I stopped I think around June or July and was fine up until now. Now it is the fall (end of October) and I‚Äôm having trouble breathing again! The same feeling as how I feel in the spring. Is it possible that my allergies are just getting worse and worse each year or am I misdiagnosed and something else is wrong? Has anyone else with asthma developed it in their adult years? If so, what seasons. What allergens are there in fall that could be doing this to me? It‚Äôs causing a lot of sleep issues. It flares up worse in the night."
"Seriously, boys and girls, if you haven't tried the OG Advair HFA yet, I highly recommend it, cause it will straight up CURE your asthma (as in NO MORE RESCUE INHALERS or feeling like an asthmatic AT ALL). Please get on it if your asthma is out of control or if you ever have to use a rescue inhaler these days."
"Hello all, I‚Äôve had my Salter Aire Plus Neb for nearly 22 years, and it is time for the old gal to retire. I can no longer find quality filters, so I am looking to get a new nebulizer machine.

I‚Äôve been having severe asthma flare up since many days. Prednisone is not quick enough to kick in this time. I just took 400mg Magnesium Oxide and WOW it works wonders!! I can breathe better and my flare up has reduced significantly. This is amazing. I only ordered it for my anxiety/sleep but didn‚Äôt realise it helps Asthma as well. I only found out after I googled it once I started feeling better. I cannot believe what just happened it‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôve been struggling for so many days. Has anyone else tried this and did it help you? I know 400mg is on a higher side but I had ordered it for my anxiety/sleep
"I noticed that my salbutamol inhaler makes me want to cough, right after taking it, I feel a tingling sensation in my throat with an irresistible urge to cough hard. 
I have a checkup coming up this month and will mention this toy pulmonologist.
I told this to my primary care physician, who gave me a fenoterol inhaler to try out. It works better (no tingling), but burns a little, like breathing in some mild detergent like alcohol (maybe because it contains some alcoholü§î).
Anyone here having a similar reaction to Salbutamol?"

"I am quitting my job today. 

I work at a fast food restaurant and often work the front counter and drive thru, not kitchens. Cigarette smoke is my biggest asthma trigger and after two months of half assed accommodations I‚Äôve had enough. Multiple times I‚Äôve been told things like ‚Äúwell what if you‚Äôre alone and there‚Äôs a drive thru order with a smoker and kitchen is busy?‚Äù And, ‚ÄúI get you have asthma but you can‚Äôt be afraid of the customer.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm tired of the ignorance and the blatant disregard for my health. It‚Äôd be less annoying if they were just upfront and say ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs not gonna work‚Äù but they keep saying they‚Äôll train kitchen to do drive thru orders in case someone‚Äôs smoking or think of moving me to kitchen or the other location owned by the same person that is larger so I don‚Äôt have to do front counter. Never happens. Just says to avoid it and have someone else take it when it‚Äôs a smoker, but then ‚Äúwhat happens if no one else can take it?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúThis asthma thing. Is it gonna be an issue?‚Äù Well‚Ä¶ yes‚Ä¶ it could literally kill me so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs an issue. I‚Äôve even said EXACTLY that. No beating around the bush, I‚Äôve said it could potentially kill or put me in the hospital. I think all they hear is ‚Äòit wouldn‚Äôt kill you‚Ä¶‚Äô

I even said I‚Äôd quit if they couldn‚Äôt find a solution, but they just say ‚Äòokay, we have a solution,‚Äô and then practically do nothing. Even with having someone else take cash and food when I notice it‚Äôs a smoker, I‚Äôve had people hide it by their side so I don‚Äôt immediately see them blow a big puff in my face. 

Even aside, our drive thru/ taking out trash work sweaters are shared‚Ä¶ gross considering covid‚Ä¶ and then also because my coworkers are ‚ú®multitaskers‚ú® they smoke while taking out the trash or going their breaks while wearing the sweaters. 

Two more incidents of a coworker and manager making a snarky and ignorant comment two days ago and I‚Äôve decided to quit without finding another job. Two weeks notice and nothing more, I‚Äôm tempted to not even give them that."
"Hi, 

I have recently been diagnosed with Asthma in my early thirties. The trigger for this was at first a suspected chest infection for which I had two courses of antibiotics and some oral steroids, this didn't seem to clear up and so another doctor suggested it might be late onset adult asthma. I was given another course of oral steroids after ending up in A&amp;E and requiring some nebulisers. After this I was put on Clenil and Salbutamol and then a month later had the Clenil changed to Fostair. Earlier this week I was admitted to A&amp;E and yet again put on nebulisers because I was floored by a mild cold that I caught. 

I have had no spirometry tests, no PF testing, no allergy testing or blood tests to confirm that what I have is asthma, my question is, is it worth pushing for all of these things just to make sure it is in fact asthma? Nebulisers and oral steroids have been fantastic in treating the acute attacks but it seems like my day to day inhalers aren't helping. 

Any insights or advice would be much appreciated :)"
"Can asthma cause so much fatigue that I cannot do my day to day chores and even little bit of work (as the title suggests) causes my muscles to get extremely tired/fatigued. Is this asthma or something else? My pulmonologist has given up on me and says these symptoms are not asthma related. It does not happen on all days but only when I have chest tightness/flare up ( which in
My case has been almost everyday for past one month as of now) . Anybody else has experienced something similar ?"

I don't know I just feel like I'm doomed anyway because of my asthma.

I also don't take my preventer pump at all which I'm going to start doing now."
"Is not being able to breathe when you're hungover common? I mean gasping for air... also reading 100-110 bpm on my fitbit

For some context- I sort of have asthma... I had it severely when I was a kid. I had some sort of breathing contraption I would carry around and was in and out of the hospital all of the time, many cases of pneumonia before I was one

I say sort of have asthma because it usually doesn't bother me unless I'm doing intense cardio or am hungover.

I don't feel anxious... I wouldn't attribute it to anxiety, personally. It just feels like my body isn't absorbing oxygen. I'm not able to speak because it leaves me too breathless. Otherwise healthy. I exercise. I eat well. I'm not overweight.

Does anyone else get this? Is this worrisome? Feedback?"
This is my first time using my inhaler for my newly diagnosed asthma. My main symptom is tightness/ a cough. I definitely feel better but the tightness isn‚Äôt 100% gone.. is this normal?

Is it okay if I drink alcohol? Obviously in moderation. I had 2 puffs 3 hours ago and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve had today. Just starting this medication. Am not planning to have more puffs until tomorrow since it makes me feel jittery.
"I‚Äôve been terrified of catchIng COVID because I am both obese (losing it) and have asthma from seasonal allergies. My dad also has COPD.

I‚Äôm curious, for those who have been infected what was your situation like?"
"I‚Äôm not having a proper asthma attack, but for the last half an hour my chest has been feel tight and been wheezing, I don‚Äôt have my blue inhaler. What should I do?"
"I have latent adult onset asthma. I was first prescribed albuterol PRN and things just got worse so I was put maxed dose of symbicort which didn‚Äôt help. Earlier this year, when a new lung doctor put me on oral steroids for I think two weeks, it was heaven in earth. He then put me on montenuclast which helped like 70-80% but nowhere near the benefit that I got from oral steroids. Around summer, he added spiriva which helped like an additional 5-10% only then I just got tired going to doctors offices so I stopped going. 

I have a follow up appointment in December. Should I ask that I should be on a nebulizer? I‚Äôm willing to buy a portable one and bring it in my purse everyday. 

I just want the same euphoria I felt while I was in oral steroids."
"I used to have asthma as a kid due to seasonal allergies. If I managed to control my allergies, no need for asthma medication.

It went on like this for the last 35 years.

Then six months ago I got a nasty ear infection for which I started using ear drops. It was off an on again and I opted not to use oral antibiotics becaus they really affect my stomach (IBS). 

Two months ago I got a cold and since then I‚Äôll have reoccurring ear infections that will sometimes move to my nose or my throat/chest. 

I visited an online doctor and they gave me flovent hfa 220 mcg inhaler and told me to take it for a month. It‚Äôs day three and already it‚Äôs making my anxiety terrible.

Do you guys think it‚Äôs asthma or I need to get a stronger antibiotic? Maybe bite the bullet and do an oral one along with the drops? 

Thanks"
"Hi friends - one of the things I‚Äôm most Self conscious of is my mouth breathing and how loud my breathing is. When my mouth is closed I legitimately feel like I‚Äôm suffocating. 

I‚Äôll be in the checkout line at the grocery store huffing and puffing like I just ran a mile. Friends on the phone ask me why I‚Äôm so out of breath. I get looks.

So my question is this: any tips? What can be done to help improve this??? Thx in advance"

"**TLDR : I think I might have asthma. How did you know you had it?**

So I've been having some sort of breathing problem since January. One day I woke up and I had a meeting for uni. While listening to my professor I suddenly felt like I couldn't take a deep breath or something and got a little bit panicky and felt my heart rate increase a little bit. I thought I had an allergy or something it lasted a few hours I guess but next day I still felt like I couldn't take a deep breath, even though I was breathing fine. 

Two weeks later, I felt again like I couldn't breathe and got tachycardia as in 130bpm so I went to the ER. They gave me a beta-blocker to decrease my heart rate, tested me for COVID (antigen, negative), got an X-ray for my lungs and EKG. They are all pretty much normal. The doctor did prescribe me though some beta-blockers in case I got tachy again and some medication for bronchitis (???).

The following day I went to a pulmonologist, had another X-ray which he said was fine and it was all in my head. And then to a cardiologist to see if there was something wrong with my heart. Had another EKG and an echo which were normal so she checked my thyroid said it seems enlarged. She sent me to an endocrinologist. At this time I could barely walk up a flight of stairs without being breathless I'd say. And I was generally feeling out of breath and had some sort of chest tightness. While in the ER I had 99-98% O2 sat stats if I remember correctly so I don't know.

Ok, so I went to an endocrinologist got my thyroid checked and shocker, it was fine. This was in March or April I think. At this point I was already feeling better and I was sick of going from doctor to doctor telling me I'm fine and it's all in my head. Around this time I noticed I had a wheezing. I'm not sure if it had been there before, but at this point I was sure I had it. I would come and go. 

So fast forward to today. I still have wheezing from time time to time. I'd say it's worse? It's mostly present at night. I'm not sure if this might be asthma it's really weird. Haven't had any palpitations/tachycardia since then though so that's good xD. I have to mention that my dad had asthma when he was little (he doesn't anymore).

My symptoms would be: feeling like I can't take a deep breath, wheezing, a dry cough sometimes, and sometimes there's this discomfort around my ribcage, I don't even know how to describe it, like a rubber band holding it from expanding or something I don't know. I also have a stuffed nose all the damn time since January. Does asthma just come like that? Can it happen like that? It's really weird. 

I also noticed when I go to someone's apartment and they smoke inside, next day I get wheezy and all the nasty symptoms I mentioned before.

I sort of got used to it. Some weeks are ok, some are worse. As I'm writing I'm wheezing (it's not the worst wheeze I'd say but you can definitely hear it)  and I have a dry cough and it drives me crazy.

So I just wanted to ask you how did you know you had asthma, what your symptoms were etc."
"I recently started using breo but I've found that I only need it every other night not every single night. There isn't anything wrong with that, right? I don't like the idea of using it every single night. Also it works pretty quick if I'm wheezing, has anyone experienced that?"

"Hey everyone! Little bit of relevant background information before I get to my question itself: I'm a 23 year old male with very well controlled asthma, the kind of which rarely if ever provides for a serious health condition despite having had it since birth. I'm ever so slightly underweight (around 64KG at 6ft1).

Last Thursday, I took quite unwell rather rapidly, coming home from work with basically everything that could be wrong, spending the entire night awake and in pain with a fever and coughing. This lead to me being admitted to hospital on Friday with Pneumonia, a condition that I have only ever had once before at age 7 (the ONLY other time that my asthma has ever been bad). Cut to today and I've been out of the hospital for three days and I have been given a 2 week course of antibiotics to continue fighting the infection. Furthermore, I got the news today that my pneumonia originated as a common cold before mutating into the infection I currently have a day or two prior to the aformentioned Thursday. 

I am feeling better by the day, but one thing is always lurking and that is a strong fatigue. I don't feel tired, but everything just feels as though it's done too much? Thus, my question would be to anybody who's reading, do you think that this fatigue will pass soon? I know it's VERY hard to know when it comes to stuff like this, but I'm curious what others think. Trying as best I can to stay optimistic!"
"Hey everyone! Is you ever wondered what is the effect of Singulair (Montelukast) on your resting heart rate then I would like to share with you my personal experience. 

A little intro:
I am a 22yp female who developed a mild asthma after mild pneumonia last winter. I also have some acid reflux issues so that doesn't help. From January to April I was on Flovent or Alvesco + Salbutamol. I couldn't handle any of those so the doctor put me on Montelukast in May. I have been taking it ever since. I would take it before bed and after 2 weeks, I had zero symptoms. I felt pretty lightheaded for the first 2 months but then it went away. My anxiety got a bit worse and I did get some weird dreams but I decided to power through it. In late August, I tried to stop taking any meds but went back 3 weeks later. About 2 weeks ago, I decided to no longer take Montelukast at night and instead I started taking it at 1pm during the day. Throughout my treatment, I have been monitoring my resting heart rate using my Fitbit app and I would like to share with you the results. 


My resting heart rate (RHR) as of June was oscillating between 78 and 80bpm. I must admit, the whole time I felt super out of shape, I also felt pretty tired even after a good night sleep. When I stopped taking Montelukast in August, my RHR immediately started dropping and within 3 weeks went down to 68bpm. I was really surprised but I was on vacation so I thought that maybe that was the reason. As soon as I went back on it, it started climbing back and once again stabilized around 79bpm. Since I switched to taking the meds during the day 2 weeks ago, my RHR started dropping again and today it's at 71bpm. I feel so well rested, I sleep 10x better and my anxiety is almost non existent. I did not change my habits in any way so now I am 100% certain that Montelukast was the cause of this RHR difference. 

I am curious to hear if anyone else has made an observation like this, but if not, just wanted to share this personal experience :)

Stay healthy everyone!"
Anyone else ever have this problem?
"I cannot take part in things i used to . if i do in a few days i will immediately or few days feel bad effects . i can go upstairs now that im on a preventer ( flovant) works amazingly but now this year unfortunately i am almost back to where i have started . in a way im okay with it cause i feel well prepared but now that im not a kid anymore it sucks cause well i want to have fun with friends , and lately this summer passing i got hit hard with depression due to the virus . what will happen if i get it ? i felt so low and miserable but i realize theres people who have it way worse and have gotton covid as well and i cant imagine what kind of scary experience it is with both . anyway hope you are all feeling okay today and stay safe"

"Anyone else notice the slightest change in air pollution in their breathing. I use to only notice when it would be an orange air day (AQI 100+), now if it goes from green to yellow (AQI 50+) I flare and feeling my chest getting tighter like it‚Äôs stitching itself up and my breathing gets shallower. The chest pressure is so painful and distracting. It‚Äôs frustrating to me, I feel like my rules for what triggers the asthma changed. I‚Äôm much more sensitive now to smaller increases in fine dust. This all got worse after this summer. My heart goes out to all you. Just wanting reassurance I‚Äôm not alone."
anyone else get this ? like it feels like a start of a cold but ‚Ä¶ not really ?? i believe i have had this before then sufferd a huge flare up but i dont think this is as bad because it was back in the winter. like youd get a cough sorta like a cold but its easy to control before it gets out of hand ? Lol
Any suggestions as to how I can change my lifestyle or some tips and tests I can do that could help me get over this. Thanks
"I have bronchial asthma and strong allergies, I have the most air and breath the best when I drink alcohol at party... what about you? 

And why is that?"
"I have bronhial asthma + strong allergies most of the year; sometimes its hard for me to breath and it comes randomly 

My condition became so normal to me that sometimes it is hard for me recognize if I breath normally or not, I start thinking, right now I dont feel good because I cannot breath properly but again in another second I think maybe I am just hypochondariac, I cannot spot difference between normal and not normal... :("
I had pretty bad childhood asthma. Enough that I had to take steroids for my underdeveloped lungs. I grew out of it mostly but have been prescribed inhalers in adulthood like when I got bronchitis. I‚Äôm really into cardio especially long distance running and no mater the distance I catch my breath after very fast. I have noticed I can‚Äôt though hold my breath at all. Maybe 15-20 seconds is the best I can do while swimming under water or 45 seconds sitting completely still. It also takes a long time after holding breath to re catch my breath. I‚Äôm just wondering maybe anyone else has this issue or maybe it‚Äôs just me.
"Is this normal to have chest pain, like sharp stabbing. It started wrapping around to my middle back too. I was having an asthma attack and I took my albuterol rescue inhaler, and after I took the inhaler I could breathe but I had really sharp pain. It started to concern me and agitate me. I‚Äôve had asthma my entire life but this past week it‚Äôs been the worst it‚Äôs been in 10 years. It‚Äôs usually rarely noticeable. But I have really bad cat allergies and I had a cat in my room this week and I‚Äôve been hanging around my ex that got a cat since we broke up. I thought it was that so I moved the cat litter box out of my room. I‚Äôm wondering if I need asthma treatment. Anyways this chest and back pain is intense."
"When I was a little girl I had the worst asthma. When I was a baby (not even a year old), I collapsed and was out of breath and had to be rushed to the hospital. The hospital and the ER was a frequent place to be when I was young - and being in bed hooked to a nebulizer, on lots of medicine and all of that was a common thing too. I was frequently out of school due to asthma (I was practically home schooled and had no chance in making legit friends), I barely played any sports because I would simply run out of breath within minutes and the fall and spring seasons were the worst, I had to wear a surgical mask (pre-Covid) outside due to allergies &amp; I nearly had a full-blown asthma attack at my own Bat Mitzvah.

However, this all changed in the second half of high school where breathing and my triggers became less frequent. Nowadays, I still have asthma but nothing like when I was young. I exercise, I'm fit and I'm more in control. And thankfully, asthma is a minor 'once a year' issue for me.

""Traumatized"" is probably too intense of a word but my severe asthma did effected me, still haunts me - the hospitals, the sick beds, hearing my family worrying about me, the wearing of masks and tubes just to take a full breath of air and just feeling helpless and fearing that at any day this might kill me.

I'm curious to anyone who had severe asthma - what was it like for you?"
"Guys I just used my water pick to unclog an inhaler.   Worked like a freakin charm.     


FYI"
"I'm 18 and I've had asthma all my life and I can control it now. I'm fine all day and take my inhaler when I need to. I'm perfectly fine when I sit but as soon as I lay down I feel like I can't breathe, even when I took my inhaler just moments beforehand. 

Does anyone know why?"
"My most common symptom with asthma is tightness of the chest. This often doesn‚Äôt allow me to sleep because of how uncomfortable it feels. 
I currently have 3 inhalers and some nights i‚Äôll use them to try to relieve the tightness and it doesn‚Äôt work, no matter how many times i use them. They keep my coughing somewhat under control, but I always end up having to sleep off the chest tightness for it to go away. 
I was wondering if I need a stronger inhaler because of this or wether my chest tightness can be relieved another way."
"Well my problem is exactly the title lol, running out of albuterol on my last 70 puffs before I‚Äôm out of an emergency inhaler. Don‚Äôt have Medicare/any insurance..looking for options to get a new inhaler please let me know if anyone knows of any thing!"

"I came down with bronchitis 3.5 weeks ago. About 3 weeks ago I went to urgent care for treatment because I was struggling to breathe. 

When I was a kid I needed a nebulizer for treatment during illnesses and an inhaler for allergy induced asthma. I had an inhaler through high school, but primarily used for exercise. I didn‚Äôt use it much in college and now at 30 years old I honestly forgot I ever had an inhaler until this bout of bronchitis. I don‚Äôt even have a doctor, which is why I went to urgent care for help.

Urgent care prescribed 5 days of z pack and prednisone, plus an albuterol rescue inhaler. It helped a bit but it didn‚Äôt go away after the 5 days. Inhaler is the only thing giving me relief but I‚Äôm trying to stick to 2 puffs every 4 hours. 

The wheezing doesn‚Äôt bother me as much and my cough definitely isn‚Äôt as deep as it was 3 weeks ago‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs the shortness of breath between inhaler doses that worries me, especially after 3 weeks. Should I be going back to urgent care for more prednisone? I don‚Äôt want it to turn into pneumonia but I also don‚Äôt want to go to a germ ridden place and take additional steroids if it‚Äôs not necessary. I woke up at 2am with heaviness in my chest and shortness of breath. 

Just tired of feeling so crappy and wondering if this is normal with asthma or not? I‚Äôve had bronchitis before but it was a long time ago."
"TLDR: I have POTS/Orthostatic Hypotension, but I'm wondering if my symptoms sound like I may \*also\* have asthma? The symptoms are similar. I have random episodes where my throat and chest tightens and I have to cough to breathe. Heartbeat feels like it slows then rapid. Lasts 5-10 seconds and then I'm fine. Very scary in the moment though. 

Longer version: Hey all! First off I have bad allergies, I take 2, sometimes 3 allergy meds a say. Once a week or two, I can be doing nothing or moving around, but out of nowhere, I get this sensation at the bottom of my throat and chest that feels like sudden tightening and it feels like I have to cough to relieve the tightness. It feels like if I don‚Äôt cough, I can‚Äôt breathe. My heartbeat feels bigger/deeper during these moments, and like it slows down before rapidly speeding up again. Not sure if that‚Äôs due to me panicking/adrenaline? It usually lasts 5-10 seconds. But, I just had an episode that felt more intense/longer and I felt I was going to pass out, struggled to walk to my husband incase he had to call an ambulance, but it subsided. My cardiac doctor‚Äôs nurse told me this is a normal symptom of POTS, but I‚Äôm wondering if this also sounds like Asthma AS WELL?"
"So I ran out of Montelukast Sunday, its Thursday now. Not a major ordeal I did pick up more yesterday, but I haven't taken it yet. Tuesday night I literally got an hour of sleep or less. Heart rate up all night and felt restless in general. I can tell lately that my breathing is different. Almost like my autonomous breathing is a little slow. Lungs feel a little inflamed. I am going to hold out a few more days and see if anything major presents itself, my asthma is typically petty well controlled. Side note; since I had a bad time with covid in January I've been taking breo ellipta daily. Was previously on arnuity. But anyways, I was just wondering if anyone had any kind of singulair/montelukast withdrawal stories?"
"Whenever I go upstairs I am out of breath. I can‚Äôt really talk and have to ask whoever I with to give me a minute. The nurse at my GP office seems worried about it and I‚Äôve been asked to go in.
Weirdly though this doesn‚Äôt happen when I work out!"
"Hello all, I‚Äôm not sure how much I can do about this situation.

I am flying overseas soon, first time since having developed asthmatic response to cleaning products and other chemicals, perfumes, scents.

As you can imagine I am very very anxious about flying. Although I know planes have filters that replace the air.. I just cannot get the image out of my mind that I will be stuck in a tin can that has been absolutely doused in who-knows-what chemicals.

I know they clean the planes so thoroughly for everyone‚Äôs safety but shit I‚Äôm just so worried.

If you have flown since the pandemic starting please let me know what it‚Äôs like and what you did to cope so I can be prepared.

Thank you all. Hope you all stay well and safe."

"Hello, I have been taking breo for the last 2 years and it's been great üëç Unfortunately, I ran out of it yesterday (Tuesday)but I will not be able to get it refilled until Monday. This evening my asthma started getting really bad, and while my ventolin is helping I know I can't take that a bunch of times either. I do however have prednisone in my possession but I've never taken it before. My question fir you is : Can I take prednisone as a temporary replacement to my breo? I called my pharmacy and asked them to which they replied saying I must fill Breo ASAP. Thank you for reading this post, and any suggestions is greatly appreciated."
"So I have had asthma since I was a child and it‚Äôs just a regular occurrence. However, lately I‚Äôve been having a weird sensation in my throat that feels like my airway is tight or blocked - it‚Äôs almost like when you breathe in perfume or something strong. I‚Äôm not sure if this is an asthma thing or something I should be worried about. Has anyone experienced this?"
Ugh. Allergies turn into head cold. Head cold turns into upper respiratory problems. Upper respiratory problems turn into chest heaviness. Chest heaviness turns into asthma flair.  Yay for Z packs and steroids!!!
"I just got a new cat yesterday, but last night I noticed I had some night time asthma symptoms again, such as a tight chest. I took my inhaler and was ok. I get tight lungs usually only once or twice a month and only at night. I hung out with my friend‚Äôs cats before getting a cat, and have never had a reaction, although I was only around my friend‚Äôs cats for a few hours. Last night might have just been by chance the random night during the month that my body decided to have chest tightness, but I‚Äôm wondering if cats can cause asthma symptoms even when someone isn‚Äôt allergic? I‚Äôm also looking for any advice from people who have asthma, but own cats. Also I take 1 puff of symbicort 2x daily, and a reliever inhaler as needed, which isn‚Äôt often except when I get asthma occasionally at night, or when I‚Äôm around triggers such as fire smoke or cooking something really oily."

"I‚Äôm moderately to severe asthmatic with scarring to my right lung and possible bronchiectasis and a history of atelactasis. 

The past two days, my breathing has been horrible. I can‚Äôt take enough air in. My voice is hoarse and I hear a whistle when I exhale. 

My peak flow meter is normally 400-450, it‚Äôs now 250-300. I‚Äôve been using my home nebulizer but it‚Äôs not working."
"

I was diagnosed with Asthma and Acute Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis. Before today‚Äôs official diagnosis I was hospitalized twice and I‚Äôm currently home on prednisone tapers. 

My pet Rabbit had been giving me a hard time but was given to my parents weeks before my hospitalization so I think he contributed to my breathing issues but wasn‚Äôt my main cause. 

Long story short my Drs won‚Äôt leave me alone when it comes to my birds which are two fancy breed pigeons 

they want me to try to isolate myself for a month from them I can get my fianc√© to help me with them and mostly keep them in the bathroom but I don‚Äôt see myself never interacting with them. 

On top of that they are pushing me to rehome my birds which honestly I refuse to do can anyone help me with ways I can keep them and manage my illness ?"
"recall having them ever since a kid playing soccer..

I.E find yourself taking deep breaths throughout the day then breathing shallow the rest of the time? is it asthma form or just anxiety?"
"I‚Äôve (37/f) had asthma for as long as I can remember. However I like smoking weed. Went &amp; had a lung function test this week and it wasn‚Äôt good, either was the sounds of my lungs according to the doc. Got prescribed a 5 day round of prednisone. Plan on edibles during this time so my lungs can hopefully heal up. Does anyone else with asthma smoke? What‚Äôs the healthiest vaporizer for dry herb for an asthmatic?"
"I've only been using a peak flow meter for several weeks.  I mostly understand how to use it, and to do 3 tries and take the highest reading.  My question is, once in a while my first reading is crazy-high, like 75-100 points higher than I'm usually doing, and then my 2nd &amp; 3rd are far below that.  I'm wondering if it might actually be valid (I've read that some people can induce a little bronchospasm if you blow hard into the meter).  If I'm just 20-30 points higher than the other 2 readings, I'm thinking that's valid, but I'm just wondering about the much-higher ones."
Does anybody use their nebuliser and saline as a preventative? Like if they feel a bit more chesty than usual? Is it good for just keeping lungs in general ok condition? Or am I on the totally wrong path thinking this...
"Hey everyone! I suffered from asthma as a kid but didn‚Äôt get worse until about 3 years ago and now on daily advair 2xs a day and albuterol as needed. 

My question is: has anyone had shortness of breath; difficulty inhaling and exhaustion after walking without wheezing? 

My asthma typically comes in episodes of wheezing, congestion and chest pain. But this time around no wheezing.

I went to the ER and they ruled out anything heart related; no PE. Did an ultrasound and a CT with contrast. Only said some lung scarring and 2 tiny nodules. Sent me home with 5 days prednisone. It‚Äôs been 4 days and no relief. I have a lung functioning test next week but wanted to reach out if anyone has felt this way before with their asthma or if it‚Äôs maybe another underlying issue."
"I‚Äôve had asthma my whole life and it always gets way worse in the fall/winter. Currently, it‚Äôs getting to the point of taking my albuterol inhaler like 7 times a day. It‚Äôs especially scary since I just got a higher dosage of Flovent in august so you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be doing fine right now. 

Point is, albuterol is starting to not work and I‚Äôm gonna need breathing treatments. If that stops working I‚Äôll need to go to the hospital but covid exists and aghhhhhhhh. 

It‚Äôs already traumatic because some years back I was admitted to the hospital for some days and was this close ü§è to death. I‚Äôm internally panicking and my asthma is getting worse and worse by the day. It wasn‚Äôt even bad like a week ago"
"Hi, since I started going to sauna couple times a week my breathing condition has improved - I have bronhial asthma and strong allergies - all the time I feel like I dont have enough air - Sauna helped me a lot and its amazing! 

What is your opinion?"
"Hey everyone. I‚Äôve had asthma symptoms my whole life but only working on a diagnosis now as an adult. Have tests etc next month.

One symptom that seems unclear to me is waking in the night. Fairly often I‚Äôll wake coughing, as if I‚Äôm choking, and my throat will be burning. Very scary as initially I can‚Äôt breathe but after a minute it‚Äôs fine - it‚Äôs almost akin to when you swallow food the wrong way. Does this sound like asthma or more like choking on acid reflux? (Don‚Äôt worry I will bring this up with a doctor)

"Is your lung function worse in the morning? I noticed that my lung function is better when measured in the afternoon (measured by nurse, not at home)"

"Just a vent.

Anyway, I installed a fresh filter and vacuumed out the air intake of my new apartment so I wouldn't have to put up with asthma attack chains. What I hadn‚Äôt realized was that the heater would go through different channels, burn up a bunch of dust, and then belch it out into the air. I can‚Äôt stay five minutes outside of my bedroom (where my air purifier is) without snapping up my inhaler.

I ended up taking WAAAY more puffs than recommended and tried to ventilate the place, but I found that I only have 1 window I could open. Another window can be propped. The rest of everything has no insect screens. I risk letting the cats loose (I'm not triggered by cats, thankfully).

I also found that one of my cats, Sunny, has allergies. He's wandering around the apartment like me, sneezing all over the place. 

I've put in a service request AND made a call to the office to tell them exactly how bad it is (if the fact that i could die in my sleep doesn't get them moving idk what will). I've had to take time off of work because it's affected me so badly. I'm spending time at a friend's house to alleviate the attacks but I can't just STAY here.

Ugh. I've had asthma since I was very small, so small that I can't remember ever not having it. Usually I'm fine these days. Controlled and healthy. Ever since the damn heater kicked on, though, I have been having chains of attacks that would have sent me to the ER if I still lived in Canada (but now in the USA I don‚Äôt want to take on that cost).

Thanks for reading"
"Life-long asthmatic here. For the past 2 months, I‚Äôve been having an asthma flair up. Im on 100/50 advair, albuterol inhaler and Zyrtec. Took prednisone for a week. It helped a little but my lungs still haven‚Äôt felt back to normal yet.

I‚Äôve been to the doctor and they always say my lungs sound fine. Chest X-Ray came back great. Saw an allergist, took a flow test and he said it was fairly normal.

So why the hell do I still feel like I have a weight on my chest all freaking day. It‚Äôs especially worse at night when I lay down. My lungs feel irritated. They feel dry even though the humidity in my house is over 65% (which I know may be a problem).

Anyone else feel this way? Your breathing is supposedly normal on tests but doesn‚Äôt feel normal? I‚Äôve dealt with asthma since I was a kid so I know what my normal feels like and this is not it. Ugh."
So i just read theres a certain strain that causes asthma attacks in some people ( i was laughing like crazy started coughing and weezing started to loose balance and got dizzy and panic and then throat and as as sinuses got stuffy ) also at my cousins house my cousin had a strain that smelled the same i didnt smoke it cause of that reason but being around them smoking i had this chronic cough and wheezing that was really really bad i couldnt even sleep
"My 2 year old was recently (maybe 6 weeks ago) diagnosed with asthma after a couple of colds landed us in the ER for difficulty breathing. He is on Flovent twice a day for the rest of the winter and Albuterol every 4 hours (as needed, when he‚Äôs sick or coughing a lot).

I have a lot of anxiety about this because I am not sure what constitutes an emergency and needs a trip to the ER. It seems I get mixed info from doctors and I want to be able to differentiate between ‚Äútake him in‚Äù and ‚Äúpoor baby is going to have a low key day or two‚Äù. 

Most of the time what I notice is ‚Äúsee-saw breathing‚Äù which is when the area around his sternum sinks and his stomach rises during inhalation. This seems to happen to some degree pretty consistently when he is sick, but I‚Äôm never sure at what point to take him to the ER or urgent care. Can any parents of little ones with asthma share how they make this decision?

Of course I will do whatever I need to in order to keep him safe, but if I don‚Äôt need to take him to the ER (which costs $250 every time‚Ä¶and he‚Äôs sick at least once a month), I would be relieved. 

Any advice or suggestions are welcome and appreciated, thank you!"

"I was prescribed a nasal spray (Fluticasone) to help with my allergy symptoms before I start with my immunotherapy. They are working so well that I have had no symptoms for the past 2 weeks. Been using it once in the morning and once in the evening. But as it is a steroid medication, I was curious whether this is a good long term option? Has been anyone used it consistently every day for long durations? Did anyone have any side effects from it?

I am on a maintenance inhaler - Budesonide/Formoterol for my asthma. One puff two times a day through a spacer."

So last week i started a new part time class at a college two days a week, and i‚Äôm really enjoying it. the one thing i‚Äôm not enjoying is the stairs to get to my classroom. 

it‚Äôs on the fifth floor (which is pretty high up) and having to walk all the way up made me feel really dizzy and out of breath. I had to take my rescue inhalers about a third of the way there due to my inability to breathe normally.

So today I talked to the admin and they were very understanding and made a request to get me an elevator pass, (which i should hopefully be getting in the coming days/weeks) even though I don‚Äôt *actually* go to the school full time, and I got to use the elevator instead of walking up the seemingly endless staircase of hell.

i felt like royalty taking the elevator omg and slightly guilty üòì literally something that people take for granted is my saving graceüò≠"
"Hi, I am 19 year old male and have just got back into 11 a side football. On top of not being that  fit I am certain I  have got asthma, I was playing last Saturday and it was cold and my lungs went so tight to the point I was lightheaded and my lungs have been tight since. I am gonna go to a GP about it soon but I was wondering if I was to wear another layer or two would it help because id be warmer overall or just any advice on it?

I‚Äôve coughed to the point my ribs are messed up (pulled muscle? I didn‚Äôt hear a crack but it‚Äôs a sharp pain every inhale) and it‚Äôs super painful every time I cough. They sent me for an X-ray to see if it‚Äôs pneumonia, but is there anything else I could be asking for if it‚Äôs not?

"I tried the Mucus cleanser from a company called ital life apparently the less mucus in your body the less problematic asthma is in some cases asthma and bronchitis can go away completely.

The mucus also helps to reduce phlegm and kills respiratory viruses and it made more snorig reduce because it cleared my sinuses.

"Hi all, the life insurance statement of health asks if you‚Äôve been diagnosed or treated for asthma. For those of you that have completed this and answered yes, did it result in follow up lab work/questions or a denial? Thanks."
"So allow me to share my story, so ive had childhood asthma for a long time, but out-grew it and got over it and it hasn't been a problem for much of my life. Fast forward to January of 2020, I was at a friend's house and I stupidly smoked a lot, triggering a terrible terrible asthma attack. for months i had severe shortness of breath, but it eventually subsided to some extent but i never felt 'back to normal', out of breath walking up 1 flight of stairs when i used to be able to run on the treadmill for 35 minutes straight with no problems. Then comes the summer of 2021, the most humid and disgusting summer since the 1930's dust bowl, 90% humidity every single day. Every day i basically can't breathe, its happening again. And I don't know what to do. I don't have any medication, inhalers in the past haven't worked for me and the nebulizer does but you can't use that all the time. The only thing that helps is magnesium supplements which i take an absurd amount of. This is the summer from hell that also never ends, Today is late october and i live in the North of the USA, today it was 100% humidity and like 65 and muggy out. I was at school and couldn't breathe, almost went home.

My question is, will i ever go back to the way i was? my asthma wasn't even part of my life. Like I said i was regularly running on the treadmill for 30 minutes with ease. Now i have trouble walking up 1 flight of stairs. Is my life over? because this was a terrible ordeal. If I could reverse time to 2020 and not smoke at my friend's house I absolutely would."
"Hi friends!

I'm 24F, diagnosed 2 months ago with asthma. I had it as a child but it was never serious enough for me to remember it ever having much of an effect.

Now, it is hitting me like a tonne of bricks. I just had my dosage in my inhaler upped as it wasn't working for me but it's really difficult to get an appointment with the nurse here. I have one booked for the 16th November, which seems like so long away.

Im just looking for some reassurance.. Basically. There can be good and bad days, but sometimes I feel like I'm gonna die and then I start to panic, and so it gets worse. Atm, all I can think about is my breathing 100% of the time. I feel like I can never rake a full breathe, I'm never satisfied.

Does this get any easier? Should I be asking for allergy tests or something? Will I ever go back to how I was a couple of months ago? Should I lose weight? I just don't know anything, any advice is appreciated"
"Wondering how you are doing! I am on year 5 living in Austin and will probably leave.

"Hello!

Anyone with asthma and GERD ever experienced trouble swallowing before?

I recently learned I have asthma. I was diagnosed with GERD years ago but hadn‚Äôt had issues eating for a while. Recently, I started treating my asthma so my breathing is better, but I realized my GERD is back full swing, except this time it‚Äôs silent.

I don‚Äôt have heartburn, but my throat feels perpetually irritated, so I might have silent reflux. For the past week, I‚Äôve been having trouble swallowing. I take a few bites, and then the food doesn‚Äôt want to go down. I‚Äôm super hungry, but my body physically stops me from swallowing my food. It feels almost like I‚Äôm going to choke or the food will go down the wrong pipe.

I‚Äôve lost a lot weight in a short time involuntarily, which is not good because my starting weight was in normal range. I scheduled appointments with my asthma specialist and my gastro to try to figure out a treatment plan that works for both conditions.

My appointments aren‚Äôt until next week. Any advice on what I can start doing now to be able to eat better? I need to change my diet for sure.

Thanks everyone!"

"My trigger for asthma was dust allergy and this started appearing more when i was around 18-20 years old. Tried lot of injections and medicines, but the good old pump was a steadying influence in my life.
Around 25 years got a connect with a homeopathy doctor and with a year of treatment felt quite a relief. No more wheezing and gasping for breath, was able to help out in household cleaning, and hardly had any problems.
45 years old now, my house was being remodeled and as a WFH person, kept myself in a separate room and daily helped in sweeping the floors unmindful of the dust. After more then 2 weeks of the remodeling work, was left gasping for breath, had to make emergency call to the clinic as I was hardly able to breath, got an injection for relief, and as I now write it looking again at maintaining my earlier dosage routine

Bit of a ramble tldr: had asthma triggered by dust allergy, with homeopathy was able to get relief for more then a decade, now its back."
Since I stopped smoking my asthma just got worse anyone can relate?

"This is the first time I hallucinate in my sleep paralysis, I was taking a nap and I noticed my breathing wasn't right but I was so exhausted from work so I drifted off to sleep.

I saw someone completley engulfed in the shadows come and choke me with my pillow, I tried so hard to move my arm but I couldn't and then that figure started walking around my bedroom, I woke up gasping for air and noticed I was sleeping on my back (a big no no for sleep paralysis and breathing). 

I get that I wasn't breathing well but damn did my brain have to scare the hell out of me like that?"
"Well for me I started noticing symptoms in 3rd grade. Keep in mind I was very energetic playing kickball and running around the damn house. Till
One day I started coughing real bad, my family didn‚Äôt think nothing of it and just passed it off as a regular cold and just gave me Childrens Cough Syrup, the next week my cough turned too dry chronic too a wet chronic cough, the shit was horrible. So then we went to my pediatrician where she diagnosed me with bronchitis but it later turned too Asthma because of my wheezing and worsening coughs. She then handed me a nebulizer and prescription for albuterol, the nebulizer and inhaler form.  Throughout the years we then started using controller medications too rid me of this stupid ass disease. I was then put on the Advair Diskus, but too no avail, it did not work. Secondly, I was prescribed the QVar worked but the doctor thought I could use something stronger rather Qvar. I was not prescribed the Dulera which completely rid me of symptoms it was the best feeling ever too the point where I forgot I had asthma but this all came to an end when my insurance stopped paying for it. So lastly, I had to be prescribed Symbicort, yes the shiny bright expensive inhaler that even insurance doesn‚Äôt want too pay for it. Still great effects after being hospitalized many times for this pesky little disease..
What‚Äôs your story?"

"Hi! I‚Äôm 40F and a few weeks ago I was given a suspected diagnosis of eosinophilic asthma from my specialist. 

Apparently, it‚Äôs not a clear case though. I‚Äôve done 2 lung functions test (which show a slight restriction), but both times I had no significant response to a rescue inhaler. 

I never wheeze (which I think isn‚Äôt out of the ordinary for eosinophilic asthma, but I could be wrong). I do suffer from burning pain in my lungs, and I had a high FeNO test (146). I also have frequent pain/tightness in my chest, and shortness of breath. 

I‚Äôve been on inhaled corticosteroids since the end of August and they have really helped with the burning pain. 

I was originally on Breo but I had a bad reaction to the vilanterol, so now I take 2 preventative inhalers ‚Äî one with the corticosteroids and one with a different LABA. 

I have no childhood history of asthma. I have severe dust mites allergies. I had no breathing problems before March-ish this year (except for severe shortness of breath while pregnant in 2020‚Äìthis was investigated and determined to be normal pregnancy SOB). 

That‚Äôs just some background information so you know a bit more about me. Here are my questions üôèüèª

1. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve ever had an asthma attack. It‚Äôs never been like the movies where you can‚Äôt breathe at all and it‚Äôs an emergency. Instead, I have moments where my chest gets really tight and I feel breathless, but I can still function. (I‚Äôm uncomfortable, but I can push through it.) Is that an asthma attack? 

2. When I feel like my chest is getting tight, I use a rescue inhaler (as recommended by my doctor). But I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs helping. It‚Äôs definitely not instant (again like you see on tv! üòÇ). Usually, I will gradually start to feel better after about 30 mins. But I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the inhaler or that‚Äôs just what would have happened anyway if I let time past. 

3. I have these flare up/attacks almost every day, multiple times a day (unless I‚Äôm working from home, in which case I‚Äôm on my sofa all day and don‚Äôt do much!). Again, they aren‚Äôt serious, but they aren‚Äôt comfortable and I don‚Äôt feel normal. Is this what living with asthma is like for some people? Or can I be hopeful for a better outcome? 

Of course, I will ask my doctor these questions but my next appointment isn‚Äôt until December, so I would appreciate any feedback! üôèüèª

Oh one last thing ‚Äî my doctor suspects eosinophilic asthma because my eosinophils have been high all year, and steadily increasing every month. But of course, I got my blood results after my last appointment, and they were normal for the first time all year. So maybe I don‚Äôt even have asthma. 

Thanks for reading!"
"For the last two months my lungs are in pain and i cough, i am not ill and i tested negative on Covid. So i don't know what is the problem. I am a smoker so maybe i thought that smoking has to do something with my condition. Anyways, i thought about getting an inhaler but i don't know if its safe to use if my lungs are healthy."
"Thinking about buying an airpurifier. They're a lot of money and I'm not rich, but I'm prepared to dip into my small savings if it can help. 

I live in the UK and struggle with my asthma all year round, but mainly during September - March. 

When I sleep with the window shut, the air gets moist and stuffy. When I sleep with the window open, I get that cold, dry air and wake up wheezing.

Cold, dry air is bad for asthma. But I've read that humid/moist environments can also be bad for asthma. 

It definitely feels like I can't win at the moment. 

Has anyone got an air purifier or knows someone who has? Did you/they notice any difference? Would you say it's worth it?

TIA."
"Hello guys, 

Do you drink alchohol ? In my case in at least 80% of cases alchohol makes me feel better with breathing, so I've started drinking daily. I know that's not good, but I just feel it makes me more relaxed and not so tense as usually with the breathing problems I have got."
"I started taking it about 3 weeks ago and recently I‚Äôve been so tired I can‚Äôt get out of bed in the morning. I can sleep for 8 hours and wake up exhausted and just go back to sleep. And I have these huge headaches all the time, they just never leave, because im so exhausted. I‚Äôm wondering if its my job thats killing me even though I used to be fine, or its my meds?"

"Has anyone experienced something like this ? coughing and unable to catch breath , umm drooling and unable to stand cause of being dizzy then going into complete panic then throat closing ?"
I've been trying to improve my condition by getting into exercise but I feel I sweat way more than other people. Is my body compensating for the fact it can't cool down through breathing? Does anyone else get this too?

"So I've had asthma since I was about 6yo, now 23 and since I was so young and frankly I was pretty stupid, I used my inhaler a lot, I used and abused that sucker. 1) because I have severe asthma and 2) I didn't realize it had become an addiction until I was about 20, just because it was so natural, so it didn't hit me as I was addicted to the very thing that had ""saved"" my life so many times in the past.
I wonder if you guys have any experiences on the matter?

Tldr when I was a kid I got asthma and abused my inhaler, got addicted and realized a bit late."
"Hi! A month ago, I was living in a suburb. I moved in town recently and my asthma seems to be worse than ever.

"Hey guys I was recently diagnosed with pretty bad asthma. Someone mentioned how a humidifier and air filter helped them but I have no clue what to look for.

Are there suggestions I can give to my mom for this? Please help and thank you =)"
"So here‚Äôs a bit of a backstory- I‚Äôve been on Singulair (more specifically Montelukast) pretty much my entire life. I‚Äôve always had pretty bad asthma, but I‚Äôve also had depression and anxiety symptoms that got really severe once I hit puberty. I have been put on so many different SSRI‚Äôs in the last 10 years (I‚Äôm currently 25), and a couple years ago was diagnosed with Bipolar Type 2 and put on antipsychotics which helped a lot more than the antidepressants ever did. 

I recently was having a really hard time financially and so I didn‚Äôt fill any of my prescriptions for a couple months- I know I shouldn‚Äôt have done that but there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it now. Anyways I was really surprised that my mental health has been pretty stable since then even though I stopped taking my antipsychotics. I finally had enough money to get back on some of my meds so I refilled the Montelukast and started it back up a few days ago. 

It‚Äôs like a light switch was flipped. I feel so depressed and hopeless again, and now I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs from these meds, I know they can cause depression in some people. But what alternative meds can I ask my doctor about that work just as well? Does anyone else have a similar experience? I‚Äôm just bummed about this because Singulair has always worked really well for my asthma."

"This is kinda weird but I‚Äôve had severe asthma since I was about 2 or 3, and I remember going to the respiratory therapist as a kid and doing this spirometry machine that had a chicken on it?

Do you hyperventilate often (and for a few days at a time) due to dyspnea?
"My mum has a cough that she got off him so she thinks she has it as well. The reason I‚Äôm freaking the fuck out is because my asthma is severe and at my hospital appointment last week my lungs were inflamed. I haven‚Äôt been given any steroids or anything because they wanted to see if the number comes down. 

I only have one dose of the vaccine since I‚Äôm 17 and can‚Äôt get the second. I‚Äôve taken precautions throughout the pandemic but my brother hasn‚Äôt cared at all. I literally feel like crying and maybe I‚Äôm overreacting but I‚Äôm just so annoyed at him."
"I've been so sick this autumn. Am going to doctor again today. I work with children who are full of shots and viruses, which is just constantly retriggering me. What are some alternative options you've explored as a preventative or to boost your immune system?"
"Hi everyone! I‚Äôve been dealing with what could potentially be mild asthma on and off for the past year (at least that‚Äôs what my doctor diagnosed me with). I‚Äôve done all the things - chest x ray, echocardiogram, PFT, endoscopy, you name it. My biggest symptom is difficulty speaking. Like I don‚Äôt have enough breathe for my words. The shortness of breathe rarely feels bad enough to feel like a ‚Äúflare‚Äù, though that has happened. I haven‚Äôt used albuterol enough to really know if it works. When this initially came on last year I was having a lot of days of difficulty breathing, it was also a horrible smoke year in California. Then came digestive issues, so it‚Äôs kind of a chicken and egg thing with this, but if I think about order of events the difficulty breathing started before the digestive issues. 

Just curious if anyone else‚Äôs experience resembles mine? Particularly the difficulty speaking? And if so, which maintenance inhaler do you use? I prefer spacers bc I get benefits with less side effects!"
"Hello! So basically I went to the doctors and told them my symptoms which all were asthma related and she prescribed me with an inhaler (Albuterol) and I even got an X-ray on my lungs which were crystal clear and the nurse even said they may be the best she has ever seen. Asthma and lung issues run in the family as well as heart issues, I find myself not being able to breathe after periods of working out, when there is cold air and when I'm around smoke, especially vapes which my dad vapes. Working out has made my breathing better for the most part but I still need my inhaler whenever I do workout or climb stairs for example. What do you guys think?"
"So I have always had this niggly cough, I cough when I workout cough pretty much most of the time, for a very long time, but I have serious white coat syndrome and have avoided doctors at all costs throughout my life. Anyway, I woke up at 3am today and couldnt catch my breath at all, my chest was so tight and I just felt trapped, I could barely look after my baby daughter and it got to a stage where I was actually just laid on the floor sobbing because of the fear of impending death, I don't mean to make it sound so dramatic but that is exactly what I was thinking.

Anyway, I decide to try and ignore it for as long as possible because my fear of hospitals might just outweigh that of death until my mother and partner basically dragged me in. Blood oxygen was below 90% and I could barely walk to the other side of the room, hitting a puny 170 on the peak flow test even though I am a big 6 foot lad, anyway to cut a long story short I have been told I have had asthma underlying and that must of been an attack of some degree, I can't tell how bad as I have nothing to compare it with but it is the worst I've ever felt in my life.

This is my first ever post on Reddit as I have never felt compelled to reach out to any community until this has happened, I thought everyone was diagnosed as children but I don't know. In summary, today has been real bad."
"I had a cold a few weeks ago around 4 weeks ago and I have a cough it's lingering but during this cold it set off my asthma and I almost had a attack but I controlled it 
I came off my montelukast doctors said I should as my recent mental health issue could be related 
But sometimes I get out of breath but never struggle for air and I don't wheeze either it's happens very mildly iv had asthma for years so is this just because my Airways have swelled due to the cold as a trigger"
"I'm having a horrible flare-up but I haven't been prescribed any medication for nebulization. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking of buying a nebulizer and just using a saline solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any experience with this? Will this help me at all?"
"Just finish speaking with my pulmonologist. She asked me if I felt like I was ready to go to the ER and I told he that despite the fact that not even nebulizing is giving me full relief, my stats are fine and being away from my family would probably makes everything worse. She upped my prednisone dose to one more 40 mg pill just for today, nebulizing with xopenex every 4 - 6 hours, plus pepcid for acid reflux... If in 48 hours I'm not better, or my oxygen drops to 94% or heart rate stays consistently at 130 while at rest, she told me to go to the ER. Then I would need to get evaluated for PE. Since I don't have any calf pain, or redness anywhere in my leg, and I'm wheezing and occasionally coughing, she thinks this is more asthma related than anything else, but doesn't want to dismiss a PE. Anyone who has gone through the same? I've been sick since Tuesday, after being exposed to someone with some type of viral infection (my pcr for covid was negative). Getting up to walk is a source of shortness of breath ugh. I, of course, disclosed this to the pulmonologist. Sorry for the lengthy post, I'm super stressed out too."

"Im on the third day of a 10 day course, and I feel ON GOD. I hope this stays after this course finishes..."
"As the title said, I have had 3 Asthma attacks (at least that's what the doctors think because everything else could literally be ruled out). However, Albuterol was never helping and didn't help with the constant shortness of breath that I have. However, I'm using Foster now and tbh feel better already after the first day. Is this possible?"
"have been taking symbicort for a while now. was in a mental hospitale for 9 days. build up covid stress issues

they have to give me my meds there. they gave me budesonide by itself. (not symbicort) it actually sabatoged me to be released earlier. I was revving quite high. I couldnt rest and stay calm.I tried to nap over 30 times and had bad anxiety. my fault, I puffed twice everytime they gave it to me. checked blood pressure. was quite high. 

looking for something that I dont need to take as a preventative med and something I can use as I need per instance, like when im near a cat or dusty place, strong perfume/scents around me etc. I ince used to take symbicort twce a day-day/eve, but have stopped for a long time. I dont want that going forward. I think its just wrecking me with high idling and too much anxiety. 

do they all elevate your heart rate and make you feel like youre idling at high RPM? 

what about going back to the tried and true ventolin? 

man I love subs that dont have the stupid must use flair. bravo"
"I've been looking into getting a new spirometer and I found this one called Aluna. [https://alunacare.com/](https://alunacare.com/?fbclid=IwAR3kXsx6zC-2MruCINW3O5xGjG2kM0iwWTHeA8WnV2svlgK5wVxMkK04_O4) If I go through with it, it says I need to ask my doctor for a special code to purchase it. I have no idea if it is worth it and what I would need to pay. How easy is this device to use, because I had a bluetooth spirometer before that would not work. It always had connection issues and I could not send my doctor anything."
"Hey everyone, just wondering if you've had a cough and a lot of mucus production after an extremely hard run? This was a fitness test so I went absolutely hard into the black where I was basically blacking out after the finish line. 2.4km in about 10:10 where on Monday I thought I did a max effort TT and got 10:41. So I absolutely smashed myself for that result today.



I had a feeling like something was rattling in my chest, mucus production is heavy and I've got the random urge to cough. I've been tested for asthma through a methacholine test and PFT and it was negative but I do have postnasal drip which got quite bad after the run.



No airway constriction, just mucus and that rattly chest feeling earlier with a cough but it's gone now. Just a dry cough and tickle like feeling.


Never run that pace for that long ever, I have done a good number of long runs which never make me cough like this. But I'm guessing this has to do with me pushing my body to it's limit and a bit beyond."
"Hey everyone. I have allergic asthma, and my symptoms are primarily constantly clearing my throat (post nasal drip), and coughing. The past couple of weeks my post nasal drip has been 10x worse, primarily because where I‚Äôm located, it has started to get colder. 

I believe my 2 biggest irritants are cold air &amp; dust mites. I have taken measures to limit dust in my room such as an air purifier, dusting, vacuuming, etc. this has definitely helped in regards to dust. However, the amount of times I have to clear my throat and just feeling irritated the past 2 weeks from post nasal drip, is ridiculous. Do you guys have any advice on post nasal drip? I have read about nasal sprays, nasal rinses, etc. but I honestly have no experience with these and do not know the difference between them, where to buy, etc. I would appreciate any advice!"
"It turns out I do have acid reflux pretty bad atm because cortisone f up my stomach and I also ate like garbage the past months as a coping mechanism for my asthma attacks.

My asthma is generally triggered by viruses like colds, I get bad attacks and feel terrible, but my pneumologist told me that calming down the acid reflux in general could make even those exacerbations cause by colds a bit better because you don‚Äôt have the additional inflammation provided by gerd.


What‚Äôs your experience?"
"Hello! 
The asthma journey continues, so after my visit at the pneumologist he suggested I‚Äôd take montelukast, I was really happy because I had heard some amazing things about it , but now I come here and I see more than one person talking about how singulair gave them anxiety, ocd and suicidal thoughts???!

I already have diagnosed anxiety and ocd with I already have to put effort in to manage, but also suicide thoughts? 

I want my asthma to be better no matter what but I don‚Äôt want to end up self harming or worse. Please tell me it‚Äôs usually not that bad. 

I took montelukast when I was younger a couple of years ago for 3 months but I don‚Äôt remember having any side effects, but I was only 15 and I‚Äôm now 23 and with a couple of mental disordered tendencies so I‚Äôm really scared about it."
"I've noticed lately that when I've had a new inhaler they seem to be only half full and they seem to be less effective, I found an old one that cleared up my chest immediately  but my new one took four puffs to do the same... I really hope they havent changed them breathing sucks enough as it is."
"2 days ago I got diagnosed with an asthma flare up because my lungs and chest were burning. I had childhood asthma but it went away by middle school. I was prescribed a xopenex inhaler and some prednisone in case it got bad at night. Last night it got pretty bad so I took the first dose and ended up messing up my sleep cycle. I slept 7:30am-11:30am. Now i‚Äôm wondering, can I take it earlier today or do doses have to be 24 hours apart. I‚Äôm already struggling with insomnia as a full time student so I‚Äôm rly hoping I can fix this."

"I've gone one month straight without attacks and suddenly I got one yesterday.. so much for thinking my suffering was over smh.

Anyways does anyone here know any off the counter meds for moderate to severe attacks? I can't afford to get a new inhaler and I just need suggestions for meds that cost less than a dollar."
"Is it possible to have asthma where the only symptom is coughing mucus first thing in the morning? normal pft, methacholine negative.

Other thought is reflux/lpr related but ICS do seem to help limit mucus."
"TIL from my eye doctor that my asthma preventative, Qvar, and any steroid inhalers, can cause cataracts. Early 30s F. Thankfully it‚Äôs a tiny one right now and doesn‚Äôt have much impact on my vision. 

Anyone else encounter this special bonus? I‚Äôve always struggled to find a regular asthma specialist, but going to try to find and talk to one and see if there are non-steroid ways to control asthma, because I am not aware of any."

"If short courses of prednisone (cortisol) is safe, when tapered, why are short courses of anabolic steroids (testosterone), when tapered, not safe for a very out of shape dude to get back in shape?"

Does anyone know anything about linear atelectasis? I have been having breathing problems for the past few weeks and just thought it was my asthma I got an x ray done today and they said I have a ‚Äòlinear atelectasis/scaring visualised at the anterior chest on the lateral view‚Äô does anyone know what this means or what it entails? They literally just told me to take deep breaths and make sure I am breathing long deep breaths. Like how am I supposed to not freak out that they are now saying part of my lung is collapsed. Does anyone have this or can just tell me a little about it. I‚Äôm only 20f and it‚Äôs just really scaring me because I have pretty moderate asthma and anxiety and they just told me about it like it‚Äôs nothing. I really need some help and reassurance please!

"So I had made a post in a running group but it got deleted. I thought maybe I had just gotten out of shape quickly and was looking for advice on how to retrain my lungs. It was pointed out that I may have developed exercise induced asthma.

I just got home from spending 6 months in army basic training and ait. I felt like I was in the best shape of my life right before we shipped. We didn‚Äôt do a whole lot of running in basic, but it was still very physical and included cardio. I came home feeling like I was still in shape. 

I took two weeks off and just started back up this week. I ran 2ish miles on Sunday and was doing alright until I had to get up a big hill at the end. My lungs were incredibly tight and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt get a deep breath at all. The feeling subsided after about 10mins or so of finishing. Today I ran 2 miles at roughly a 9min pace. This isn‚Äôt new to me, we used to run at an 8:30-9min pace in the army. I still just felt like I couldn‚Äôt control my breathing properly. I made it to my cool down and was breathing pretty hard and had tightness in my throat and now have a cough.

When I researched the symptoms, I realized that this isn‚Äôt anything new. I‚Äôve always gotten a cough after running and I typically chalked it up to the cold. I was a collegiate athlete prior to the military and played basketball which is a winter sport meaning if I was running, it was cold outside most likely. 

Idk if I‚Äôm just out of shape or if I could possibly have EIB. If I decide to go see somebody, is it best to seek out a pulmonologist or can I see my general physician first?"
I have asthma and I am trying to make the school cross country team. It is very hard for me to run even though I use a inhaler. I have very high endurance and stamina but have difficult breathing. I want to make the team soooo bad. Can anyone give me tips on how to run with asthma without having to walk every 200 meters. It will be highly appreciated. BTW I already checked with my doctor for advice but it didn't seem to work. The awful thing is that tomorrow the coach will time us and see our total laps and also make the team by tomorrow. I am in a dire situation please help.
"So i had asthma a long time ago when i was much younger but it went away on its own, and a year and a half ago i was at a friend's house and i stupidly smoked, had a really bad asthma attack and my lungs have never really been the same since then. when i walk up  a flight of stairs i am out of breath. its terrible. it improved a little bit. but then we had what was the hottest and most humid summer of my life, and it was tight like every day, that was terrible, and now its starting to get cold, and its still tight. HOW do i get it back to normal? does running on a treadmill help it??"
"Has this ever happened to anyone? 

I had a very scary experience this morning, while I was driving and used my rescue inhaler. After taking a really deep breath, my eyes went fuzzy and my body got tingly, I was completely disoriented and didn‚Äôt even know what I was doing with my foot on the gas. In like 5 seconds my vision came back and I realized that I had slowed to almost a stop, in the middle of the road, and the person in the car behind me had to swerve out of the to avoid me. Had I not been on a local road doing only 35, and had somebody not been paying attention behind me, I very well may not be writing this post. Never having experienced this, can anyone say similar has happened when using a rescue inhaler? Like a sudden loss of feeling/vision with a tingle sensation? Thanks for any help. I will be visiting my asthma specialist just to ask, but I just wanted to get a sense if it was normal."
"Hey all,

I have relatively minor exercise induced asthma. 2 days ago, I tried going for a run outside in \~50 degree weather, and had a flare-up. It didn't seem super extreme, but while it went away, my chest has been noticeably hurting since. This pain isn't really impacting my day to day life or anything, but it is present. Has anyone else had this happen? If so, is there anything you do that helps mitigate it? Thanks!"
"I am 27 and was recently diagnosed with asthma, though I‚Äôve been having symptoms for much longer. I am uninsured and cannot afford to see a specialist. 

At the beginning of 2020 I got sick and had an awful time breathing, worsened when spring came around. I had persistent ‚Äúcoughing attacks‚Äù that continued well after I got better. Finally seemed to be getting under control when I got Covid in November, 2020, and it got so much worse. My breathing issues persisted, and at the beginning of this year I started to wonder if I had asthma. The triggers made sense, and I had recollections of similar feelings when I was younger and would run in the cold/collapsing after a cross country race (also asthma runs in my family). I believe I had very mild asthma as a child/teenager but wasn‚Äôt aware because it didn‚Äôt look like what I thought it should  My only experience was seeing my friend have an asthma attack and being panicked and collapsing, but I cough a lot and never feel panicked even if I am close to passing out.

I am currently on montelukast and have an albuterol rescue inhaler. A major trigger for me is allergies so I also take an antihistamine and steroid nasal spray (and use a Neti pot once a day)

Since being diagnosed I‚Äôve looked at possible triggers to try to minimize my symptoms. Known triggers are: drastic changes in temperature, environmental allergies, smoke, high humidity, exercise, chemical cleaners

I live at a high elevation which doesn‚Äôt help and the air quality isn‚Äôt good due to geography. I have a medical marijuana card, but as of today I am trying to quit smoking/vaping and only ingest. 

So my questions are what else should I be doing to feel better?
Should I be using my inhaler even during minor episodes where my breathing is only a little affected?
I don't feel like I am using my inhaler properly and not getting the medicine efficiently, any tips/tricks? is it normal for it to induce coughing/make me a little dizzy?

Sorry it‚Äôs a lot, but any help is appreciated!"
"I dont feel comfy living my life on an inhaler that uses steroids. What is the big difference between having an inhaler with or without corticosteroids?? Im the type of person why tries to use medicine minimally but the past few years I wheeze horribly as soon as I lay down for bed so my pulmonologist has prescribed me 3 different inhalers that were all corticosteroids, are there other options for me? My wheezing is really bad and keeps me up at night so maybe it was really bad and that's why but I just wonder if I'm being over prescribed and if there are lesser options out there.. im trying to look into natural things outside of working with my pulmonologist"

"Long story short, I developed ""asthma"" when I was 12 and was hospitalized for a day after a horrible reaction to an allergy shot. After more than 30 years, nothing changed. Same puffers. Same results.  Not one of my doctors had any new options. I found this site, and it changed my life:

[www.asthamstory.com](https://www.asthamstory.com)

About five years ago, I drove from Southern Ontario to see a doctor in Ohio. I was tested like usual with the breathing machine, AND they did a blood test that I got back in about a week. The doctor said it was most likely an infection, mycoplasma pneumonia, even without the blood test results. Blood work confirmed.

I took antibiotics, two strong ones, each day for almost a year. Every meal tasted like metal (ugh). 

I have no asthma symptoms at all. It has been over four years now.

I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I don't believe in herbs or tinctures that cure. There is science behind these known infections.  

Why aren't doctors aren't recommending this to their patients? Money. Doctor visits cost money.  Treatments cost money. They don't want you to be cured.  

Find yourself a doctor that will do the PCR test for mycoplasma or chlamydia pneumonia (read the website). Then take the antibiotics and breathe‚Äîlong, deep, unobstructed breaths.   

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this post helps someone out there."
"It's getting cold where I am, now. And I love the cold, love autumn. It's a great season, because it's not *too* cold, and not too hot, either. Normally, for me, it's perfect for running because my asthma isn't as bad.

*Normally.*

I had a surgery a few months ago, and I wasn't able to exercise at all. It bothered me, but I still felt strong, so I was okay with it. I just dealt with the cards I was given.

Until today.

Today, I tried to run. It's 50 degrees F, not too bad.

Or so I thought.

After only fifteen minutes, maybe ten of which was *actually running,* I'm sitting in the bathroom, shower on hot to fill the room with steam, head hurting because I used my inhaler too much, and I barely got a workout in. Not even. My muscles don't ache at all, I'm not tired on that front. I'm winded, though, and *exhausted* and dizzy and so fucking *mad* because I lost *everything* I had gained the past year.

I know, I know, woe is me, since some people - especially people here - may struggle to even jog for a few minutes let alone flat-out running for an intermittently-joined ten.

It just sucks."
"Context (skip if you want): I've had asthma my whole life, but it wasn't until 2 months ago that it actually began to affect me. Because I kept holding on to the idea that ""this will pass"" I usually would tough it out through my asthma attacks but in the past 4 days it's been especially bad specifically during night. So I began to use my inhaler. I'd wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air and I'd do 1-5 puffs of my inhaler until I was able to breath. This would happen every 4ish hours sleeping so I'd be waking up 1-3 times gasping for air.


I have an albuterol Sulfate inhaler with 90mcg dosage. I used an entire inhaler (200 puffs) in these 4 days. My quality of sleep and life has plummeted and it seems  my tolerance has only skyrocketed. How bad is 200 90mcg puffs within a 4 day period? And does anyone have tips for sleeping? I've been unable to go to sleep knowing I'm going to wakeup scared grasping for air."
"I feel stupid having to ask here but I'm literally the only person I know with asthma and want to know what everyone else is doing to protect themselves.oe still taking extra precautions with a full vaccine status. Although I'm fully vaccinated, I still don't feel safe going out in public without my mask, and I don't take it off unless I've used hand sanitizer and/or washed my hands. Nobody in my immediate circle seems to understand that for someone with asthma, something as small as the common cold evolves easily into bronchitis or pneumonia. My family/friends keep putting pressure on me to see them in person since I'm fully vaccinated, and I feel guilty like I'm being selfish for not taking any chances with the state of the world right now. They just don't get it."
"Has anyone noticed their asthma will almost disappear for a couple years and then have stretches of multiple severe episodes? In the last two years I've had 4 several week episodes in which it was triggered by wild fire smoke, moving, or colds and ended up on daily nebulizer treatments and high doses (and sometimes multiple rounds) of prednisone. In this current episode I've been sick for three weeks, about to start my second round of prednisone, and have been doing breathing treatment (including steroid based ones) three times a day. The cold disappeared and I felt better for a couple days before the asthma got worse. Curious for ideas on reducing triggers, managing flare ups before they gets out of control, and when it requires further care."
"I'm new to the asthma world. Had it on and off for about 4 years now (I'm 30), but only officially diagnosed and knew for sure it's asthma a few months ago. Mine is allergy to dust mites. It's mild and well controlled (I'm on budesonide). Most of the time I'm perfectly fine, but sometimes I would feel it flare up, and 9 times of out 10, I check the weather and see heavy rain (sometimes thunderstorm) coming in. And then once the rain passed, I feel fine again. 

I live in a tropical region with rain and thunderstorm about 4 days a week, so I've had this happen a lot, not a few isolated (co)incidents. Just wondering if this is common. I tried googling it but only found articles about some huge thunderstorms that triggered asthma symptoms in people with no asthma history, but nothing about normal rain correlated with flare-ups."
"Homeopathy kind of worked for me as a teen and got me off my daily inhaler but as I grew up, I became more dependent to steroids. I was wondering if any alternatives(say ayurvedic meds) has worked for you?"
"I feel like I need to clear my throat every minute and I just used my inhaler. I think this is from my asthma. 

Has anyone else felt like this or know what is going on?"
Just a shitpost for shits and giggles lol
"Hey everyone! Happy Monday (:() so I got diagnosed with asthma not too long ago. Started with Symbicort, and It did not react well me at all. I had a major depressive and anxiety episode and it did not get better until I stoped taking it. I actually thought I was going crazy. Then I switched to Breo. Breo helped quite a bit and I did not get any of the side effects I got from the Symbicort, but I am still noticing my shortness of breath pretty consistently. It‚Äôs much easier to deal with and I am not using my rescue inhaler anymore. The only good thing about the Symbicort is it did seem to take care of my shortness of breath. My doctor thinks that even though the Breo is working well there may be one out there that can work even better. She prescribed me ‚ÄúArnuity Ellipta‚Äù the only difference I can find is that instead of two medicines (fluticasione 100MCG and vilantero 25MCG) it just has the fluticasione, but instead of 100MCG it is 200MCG. I am just worried about ruining a good thing with my Breo‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs helped a lot and doesn‚Äôt make me feel insane. However the Arnuity is the same medicine just more of it‚Ä¶. What does everyone think? Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated!"
"I can't afford health insurance and my employer doesn't offer it.

I'm out of refills for Albuterol (Ventolin) and worry I'll end up in the ER with a fat hospital bill.

Even this moment I feel like I'm being choked."
"Before I left I was suspicious it could be environmental, so I already washed all my sheets, dusted, and vacuumed. I have an air purifier that gets loud when I move anything around in the room (blankets, curtains, etc).

The only thing I've not gone through yet is under the bed and in my closet. I keep shoes in my closet and sometimes at night with no ventilation theres a smell from in there, so I wonder if it could be that, but if I keep the door closed its not too bad.

Has anyone experiences anything similar? Is there something I could be missing?"
"The doctor gave me symbicort to treat daily until my tests for asthma but sometimes, like today, it feels like I can‚Äôt breathe. Im at work and it just feels like someone is holding my lungs in their hands so I cant fill them up. Like air comes in but its not satisfying. I tried using my symbicort as an emergency inhaler but it didn‚Äôt work :( can I see a doctor for salbutamol without the tests for asthma?"
"First I tried trelegy, it made my heart feel explosive, then I tried breztri and had the same reaction. Now my pulmonologist has me trying breo 100 bc I asked for something much less strong. The inhalation is intimidating to me. I have the 14 day sample packs. After I click and go to inhale should I be inhaling meaningfully or just a regular breath. I feel like my regular breaths are slow light and drawn out and I taste the medicine when I do it that way. Sorry if it sounds silly but how hard/fast should i be inhaling? I've used these kinds a few times from trying trelegy and breztri both once but I feel like im doing something wrong maybe"
"I'm looking for any advice on air filter helping with my allergic asthma.
Usually I have very mild allergic asthma, triggered mostly by dust and dust mites and I can keep it under control with weekly cleaning. I usually don't have to use medication, except from Salbutamol from time to time. 

Since I started heating this fall my allergies have been acting up really bad. My roommate has told me that they haven't cleaned the radiators in the appartement for probably the last 10 years. 
I already tried to clean the radiator in my room as good as possible, but due to some shitty installation it's nearly impossible to remove all dust.

I want to avoid to have to go on medication during the winter, so I read some promising things about air filter/ air purifier. 
Have any of you experience or helpful tips on the matter?"

"Anyone else or just me? Or maybe this isn‚Äôt asthma related, but I feel like my chest and lower throat is always full of mucus. I don‚Äôt have a persistent cough or anything but I do have to clear my throat often. Mucinex seems to help a bit and I‚Äôm on Symbicort 2x daily."
"I was diagnosed with asthma that gets triggered by exercise 2 months ago and got prescribed Bricanyl that I am supposed to use before (and during if needed) exercise. It works pretty well for that but at the same time, I have gotten really dizzy lately. I have done blood sugar tests because I thought low blood sugar could be the issue but that looks normal. The only medication I am taking atm is Bricanyl which I use every other day ish. So after some googling, I have seen this is a common side effect of Bricanyl so I am wondering is it common to keep being dizzy a day when not using it as well (When I used it the previous day) ? I usually get dizzy when walking and not as much when sitting down. I will call my doctor if this doesn't go away and will also try to go without bricanyl for some days (Only use it if it's really needed)  and see if it goes away.

&amp;#x200B;

Read somewhere that someone got this prescribed during pregnancy and was dizzy weeks after so if anyone would know if this is the case for inhalers as well I guess it would be here."
I'm fairly new to asthma but I'm not getting on well with the few steroid inhalers I've tried. They all seem to give me headaches. Are there any 'preventer' options that aren't steroids?
"Hello folks
I was wondering if there was anyone who has moderate to severe asthma and or just asthma in general that has had a kid and has gone through pregnancy and would like to share their story. I‚Äôm only in my early 20s and it makes me so sad and scared to think that I can‚Äôt have kids because of my asthma (Ik a lot of women do but I just feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it). I would love to hear of any stories or experiences because I just find it so amazing and all of you asthmatic mothers giving birth are absolutely girl bosses and are the bravest bunch IK! I would love to hear how it went and what changed about you asthma/ medication while you were pregnant and how it was for you or for your spouse if your wife has asthma and she is okay with you sharing her story!"
Like most of you I have had asthma pretty much my entire life. In high school never played sports and gym was hard with needing my rescue almost daily. Now in my 20s and have it almost completely under control and I want to lose weight but I live in fear that as soon as I try to do any normal work out I‚Äôm going to have an extreme attack. Back in 2017 I had a new death experience while I was working construction I had an attack when my rescue ran out and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Rushed to the ER where they got me stable but I was in so much pain I just wanted to die. Because of that experience I have changed careers and had no desire to work out at all. Now being over 250 lbs I want to loose weight and don‚Äôt know where to start. I‚Äôve tried diets but my hypothyroidism makes it nearly impossible for me to lose weight from diets. Any advice is much appreciated.



"When I was taking montelukast for the first time 3 years ago I developed ocd a few weeks or months after I had it when I was younger I then got anxiety but at Christmas I had bad asthma and continued to April with bad panic attacks aswell now 4 months ago I got suicidal thoughts, depression irritability severe anxiety also aggression and my meds don't seem to be doing aswell idk what to do I feel like asking my doc to come of this med for a week and doubling my inhaled corticosteroid for the time being this is if there are side effects"
"Hi folks. I was diagnosed with Asthma a few months ago. I discovered that if taking propranolol whilst using the inhalers it could have an adverse effect on the efficacy of the asthma medicine.  
My question is, is there anyone who still takes propranolol and still use their inhalers, without any adverse effects.  
I have to be honest I stopped taking the propranolol a few days ago and my moods have been quite low. Even though it's only 10mg a day. My doctor told me to stop taking them. But I'm wondering if I might just be ok.  
In case anyone is wondering, the propranolol is for anxiety.  
Thank you."
"Like I said in the title my inhaler only gets used in spring/summer. However, my fianc√© and I went to visit a friend‚Äôs house who has a cat and I am allergic to cats, so I took an Allegra to deal my symptoms which are only itchy eyes, runny nose and mild skin itchiness. After taking the Allegra I didn‚Äôt get any of my usual cat allergy symptoms but I develop a cough within an hour. Then we went to dinner when we got back home I started wheezing really bad and my rescue inhaler did nothing to help. I took another Allegra and some Mucinex as well. I spent the whole night wheezing and coughing. 

It‚Äôs the next day and the wheezing has mostly subsided but my chest hurts. I can feel my chest is congested and there‚Äôs a lot of phlegm but nothing comes out when I try to cough it up. 
My asthma has never been triggered like this before. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this before?"
"Got COVID last year, got diagnosed with asthma in the spring. The thing is, my lungs hurt all the time, like just about 24/7 there is some degree of pain. It's never too crazy, but it's my lungs so it does freak me out a bit. Mostly a burning or tightness like they are inflamed, sometimes a sharper pain. 

So here's my question: Is that normal for asthma? I'm new to the asthma game and do not know what to expect. 

I did some tests including a CT scan and the pulmonologist said there is nothing visibly wrong so ü§∑."
"I changed from a combination inhaler to an ICS only inhaler a few weeks ago. My PEF has dropped around 20% on average, both morning and evening. During the day it‚Äôs a bit higher, but nowhere near what it used to be. It‚Äôs like this is my new baseline. Is it normal for the PEF to drop this much during a medicine change or is it a clear sign that it‚Äôs not working as well as the previous inhaler I was on?"
i used to be able to smoke them now i cant
"I've read that people with asthma usually have considerably better values in the evening than in the morning. But are there people here that this does not apply to?

I'm undergoing PEF measurements and I see good response (over 15% improvement) for the medication on some mornings, but I never see any considerable difference between my morning and evening values. I also don't see any notable response for the medication in the evenings. Why would the medicine have an effect in the morning but not in the evening?"
"So i was recently diagnosed with asthma late september. I was given flovent inhaler 220mcg with chamber ive been using twice a day for about a week now since getting prescription filled. 

Ive developed terrible SOB and chest pain, i can only describe as hyperinflation and rawness. I went to urgent care who told me i had bronchitis and to stop taking the flovent. My pulm says there is nothing else he can give me bc of my heart condition i cant take albuterol. Has this happened to anyone else? What can I do to manage my asthma without medication? I feel 100% worse now then i ever did prior to taking flovent and i hope this isnt permanent. I literally feel like a balloon os in my chst and i cant breathe even though my spo2 is 98%"
"Been dealing with this since my mid 20's (38 now).  I'll have these flare ups in my chest, extreme pain, will be brought on by cold air especially, smoke, when they're paving the roads, and a fan blowing in my face will make me real sick.

The thing is no coughing, no wheezing, occasionally feel slightly short of breath but not that much, just terrible pain.  Have tried Albuterol and it helps some, but not a whole lot.  Ibuprofen helps the most but the side effects of intestinal pain and back pain(guessing from kidneys, runs in the family) make it not worth it.

Anyone have similar symptoms and had luck with anything?  Could this be something else?  Just strange the only issue really is chest pain.  Yeah I've gone to the doctors x ray shows nothing, heart is fine.  They haven't been much help honestly."
"i can barely breath right now, i don't know if this is an anxiety attack or a asthma attack, my heart is already racing so taking my inhaler would be so stupid if it is an anxiety attack, what should I d9?"
"When going out do you have cloth masks or surgical ones? 

I‚Äôve been dealing with really bad shortness of breathe lately and I‚Äôve noticed when I use the surgical ones the next few days my shortness of breath is way worse. 

I‚Äôve tried googling if that‚Äôs a thing and it seems like the surgical ones might actually cause hypoxia in asthmatics? Anyone else deal with problems from those?"
I was prescribed Prednisone 40mgs for 4 days and then tapering off slowly from there for bronchitis. This is my first time taking a large dose of prednisone and on day two I feel like I could run a marathon..is this common?
"I have been told so much by doctors that my shortness of breath is anxiety that I am having a hard time believing otherwise myself. The doctor measured my O2 once and it was normal so I thought it can't be asthma but breathing exercises never helped and I always had to lie down to get my breath back. 

My partner always commented on my heavy breathing but I think I have had it all my life.. then one day I borrowed her inhaler and after 20 mins my vision was sharper than I can remember, brain fog lifted, my anxiety vanished and I had the best nights sleep since I can remember. I noticed a lot of symptoms I thought were from anxiety went away:

* Shortness of breath, feeling like I cannot fully empty my lungs (breathing out was difficult)
* Brain fog, ADHD like symptoms and irritability, depression
* Always feeling physically anxious and tense
* Fatigue and tiredness after small amount of exertion
* Seeing stars/swimming vision after small amount of exercise
* Nausea
* Lost appetite
* Weakness
* Rapid heartrate
* Slightly blurred vision, which I thought just meant my glasses needed renewing
* Waking up dizzy and with static vision

Are these symptoms typical of asthma?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been to doctor with all of these, and got diagnosed with anxiety, panic, and acid reflux. No test other than checking O2 were done, and they listened to my lungs once but at the time I was not short of breath. 

I got myself an inhaler (ventolin/salbutamol) it actually fixes all of these symptoms.. every single one. I'm amazed because I had long accepted that my life is a series of rolling panic attacks, and feeling terrible all the time with no energy. 

I've since identified that it seems to happen when I am exposed to dust, and possibly when I have shower (there is some mould in the shower), and definitely pollen as Summer I feel like I am dying and struggle to function on any level. I did a few hours of tidying today and kicked up a lot of dust, then afterwards I felt out of it and foggy, panicky, nauseated, slightly confused.. had a puff of the inhaler and 20 mins later my vision went really clear and I felt sharp and focused again. 

I would have expected someone would have noticed or I'd have ended up in hospital with it by now. I've never felt like I am going to pass out, but sometimes I would get headaches and feel dizzy and need to lie down most of the day just for my brain to work properly. Especially in Summer.  

I've had so many blood test at the doctor and tried so many anxiety medications I am still doubting and not sure how to approach with doctor, as I might get in trouble for buying myself an inhaler without prescription.."
"I have taken montelukast for 2 or 3 years but since I started a few months later my ocd got bad in the summer of some year and I got therapy i done good and stuff during this time I had got anxiety aswell I was given antidepressants to help me off 2 days in had suicidal thoughts and depression so I'm off the suicidal thoughts are better but not gone sane with the depression could it be that it could've done something to the montelukast to make me get suicidal thoughts and depression cause 50 days off the antidepressant and I'm better not fully tho 

I can get through every day and everything from here idk what to do I either stop montelukast on Monday when I have my call with the asthma nurse or stick it out and hope it goes ( iv had it for 5 months)"
"I got exposed to vape residue earlier today, a major trigger of mine.   
I can breathe and get air in so I don't think I need to go to urgent care.   
But my lungs, throat and back of my nasal passages are super irritated and have   
a burning feeling.   
Has anyone found anything that can soothe the tissue so it stops burning?"
"Hi guys, my asthma has been a lot worse in the last couple of years. I have tried Advair, Trelegy Ellipta, and another I can‚Äôt remember right this minute. I have not been able to tolerate any of them, I am super sensitive to medicine side effects and they all just have too many to deal with. My regular asthma meds (Xopenex) inhaler and nebulizer are just not cutting it. I‚Äôm just not really sure what to do. Any suggestions would be great."
"I was born prematurely and I was immediately on oxygen since day 1 and I have asthma and all sorts of respiratory issues - but I'm still determined to not let that beat me down! :)

I'm just curious, is anyone here born prematurely which does cause breathing / asthma troubles? What's your story?"
"I have had asthma since I was a toddler but it has always been mild. Meds are typically a convenience not a necessity kind of mild. This has changed over the past 5ish years with the development of an allergy to ragweed. Seasonally the asthma flares and  I take a low dose of Flovent to control it. No risk of not breathing, just does need treatment.

This year my asthma seems to have decided to be nasty. The flovent isn't controlling things. I have constant asthma even with the rescue inhaler. I have no difficulty breathing but I cough and its annoying. Yesterday I woke up with my chest hurting, the rescue had nearly no impact. I went for the first time in my life and got a breathing treatment, which helped for about 6 hours then my chest hurt again. They confirmed my oxygen was fine.

I am making an appointment to see the doctor. But I need to function until then. My experience does not include how to cope with this.

Triggers are environmental: ragweed and mold. Mold is driving this mess, and given the season I can't expect a significant reduction in environmental triggers for at least a month."

"I had montelukast since I was little now I'm 15 I stopped in 2019 I think I found a pack with the expire date of 2019 so maybe before but then in 2019 I was diagnosed with ocd and anxiety and 4 months ago I had suicidal thoughts and depression I blamed the antidepressants I started to take but iv been off for 50 days and I ain't getting better I'm losing hope so I'm asking if I'm getting the thoughts of suicide from the montelukast and if I had anxiety and ocd from the montelukast that the antidepressants just made it worse or made new side effects 

If I were to come off I'm scared of my asthma you know a few days of my asthma and I can't control it"
I'm scared to up the montelukast to 10mg cause I'm 15 now but I experience no side effects on 5mg
"As a child I had asthma, and I feel like it might be returning. I‚Äôve woken up with a shortness of breath every morning for a few weeks now, usually with a tightness in my chest. This sometimes lasts half an hour, sometimes until the afternoon. I renovated my room recently so I wasn‚Äôt sure if it might be dust, but as far as I can tell there isn‚Äôt any dust here. What do you recommend?"
"the literal love of my life and i broke up a few days ago, the day it happened i didn‚Äôt have access to my inhalers and i was sobbing quite a bit and i never even thought about my inhaler until that night when i realized i should be struggling to breathe, 

after i realized i should hit them bc i had forgotten i choose not to because even though i was rly sad it was the first time in months my heartbeat had fully calmed down since i started taking albuterol and flovent, i continued to not hit them for a couple days after as well as i felt no need to 

i was having next to no symptoms, and then last night i had a comforting convo with my previously mentioned ex partner which took away a very small amount of my sad, and then i wake up this morning and i can barely breathe at all. wheezing and everything , literally getting up to find my inhalers as we speak. 

could me being so sad make my body put my asthma on hold/ make me not realize i‚Äôm struggling to breathe ? has anyone else experienced this ?"
"30M and my peak flow values have been around 380 in the morning and 450 in the evening recently. I do see a marginal increase in values pre and post meds ~30. The values above are post meds. I remember it being around the same numbers many years back when I started taking my inhalers. I stopped tracking in between but I've decided to continue it now before I start with my immunotherapy. 

How have your values been over the years? Have you done something to improve it? My asthma is mild and in good control as of now but was wondering if there was any way to improve lung function."
"I just realized my doctor didn't specifically mention this. I'll try to ask ASAP, but thought I'd check here for tonight! Thanks!"
I've been on it years now and it seemed to have a noticeable effect for the first few months but it seems like i am at square one with the allergic asthma now. My IGE levels were climbing much higher each time they took the measurement trying to get insurance to pay. That was over months. Could it be possible that my IGE production is just going well above what is being sequestered by xolair?
"Just started breo after getting arnuity and having it poop out on me after a month. Just used it for the first time today and I already have a sore throat. Does this usually go away, in your collective experience?"
I'd assume most asthmatics gotta be white collar workers considering how expensive asthma is. Idk tho.
"I'm interested in using a weighted blanket to help with anxiety, but all the ones I find say they should be used by people with asthma or lung issues. My asthma usually is well controlled and I don't tend to have nighttime attacks when sick, so I have to wonder if this is more a cover your ass type thing. 

I know the usual range is 10% of your weight (for me that'd be about 10 lbs--I could probably get away with a kids' blanket!) so I'm thinking that wouldn't be THAT much pressure, especially since it's evenly distributed. Has anyone here used them, and have they noticed an effect on their asthma (or anxiety, for that matter)?"
"Before I share my new health struggle, I just want to say how much I love this group. The support I have felt (even by just reading the experiences others) makes me feel like I am NEVER alone. So I have severe asthma since my last pregnancy. I had when asthma when I was little but I had somehow managed to outgrow and it came back with a passion March of 2020. Jumping to this week, my father in law decided that it was a good idea to go to a family gathering while he had a 102 temp and was coughing and sneezing. 36-48 hours later, I'm feeling pretty shitty. I took an over the counter covid test and was faintly positive, then took two others and were negative. Spoke to my PCP got 40mg prednisone prescribed, zpack (which had done wonders in the past) and tons of vitamins. I am nebulizing every 4-6 hours, while wheezing in between and feeling short of breath by just going to the bathroom. My oxygen saturation is GREAT. 97-98-99%. My peak flow decreased slightly - from 500 when I have an exacerbation dropped to 450. No fever. No chills. No vomiting. No loss of smell or taste. Spoke to OB, pulmonologist, don't want to get involved. I spoke to my PCP a few hours ago and she wants me to go to the ER bc I should be feeling better... I started to feel really bad on Tuesday, don't understand how covid should be over by now?? Anyway, I'm also 7 weeks pregnant if I didn't mention before. I do feel better than a few hours ago (thank God!) but I feel like I need to cough and the shortness of breath shows fairly quickly upon exertion. I WILL GO TO THE HOSPITAL IF ANYTHING GETS WORSE. I'm an RN and I won't risk it, but I don't think I'm there yet. I'm not asking for advice, just words of encouragement. If this is not covid, I have never been more sick in my life. I am vaccinated with Moderna and I don't go out anywhere. Actually I'm not even working bc we're being so cautious. This is so stressful and I'm very emotional as it is."
"I was a smoker from 15-21 and then vaped from 22-26 (present) I quit about 3 months ago at this point. I had a daily, chronic phlegmy cough that was either clear or yellow mucus. I always attributed this to the vape-- and turns out, I was right (sort of). After quitting that cough essentially vanished, maybe once a week I do a purposeful cough if I feel a tickle in my throat. I did recently use my rescue inhaler (xopenex) as I got a little wheezy and proceeding to cough up some mucus for an hour (not like incessantly coughing, just forcing myself to get the gunk out) and then it passed. Not sure what to make of the phlegm/mucus that I cough up maybe once a month at this point. Ever since quitting vaping/smoking my asthma is almost entirely under control to the point of stopping my maintenance inhalers. 

If you smoke/vape and are an asthmatic and have chronic coughs-- chances are it will subside after quitting."
"Have had the mildest of asthma my whole life, can ignore it as long as I don't run, but I get occasional symptoms from time to time. My doctor recently gave me an inhaler and a spacer for when it plays up, never used it before. Tonight my chest started hurting and I started coughing, its been months since the inhaler was prescribed and I guess I forgot the directions because I took 2 puffs in one breath in the spacer, and waited a bit and didnt feel better (I just kinda thought you felt better right after or something), then I did another 2. I realized my mistake right after.

Immediately started shaking and hearts racing now. I looked online at the dosage and took way too much, didnt think much of it because I didnt know what the medicine did. The internet says not to fret unless I get chest pains, but I'd like to ask you guys if you've taken too much and if its okay?"
"Hello fellow asthmatics

I was just diagnosed by several dermatologist with Perioral Dermatitis. All of them concluded that the cause was from my inhaler. There are also multiple articles describing this link. After discontinuation of the medicine the rash cleared up, but this is not a long term solution as my breathing gets compromised. I was wondering has anyone of you experinced the same thing? And in that case what did you do?

&amp;#x200B;

Would be thankfull for an answer had this for 4 years."
"It's been a rocky journey, spent months upon months, visiting many so called "" specialists"", spending so much money and doing all sorts of diagnostic testings, guess what? It all flushed down the toilet.

I have literally spent nearly $5000 on my asthma alone, almost an year, my ashtma  literally ruined and paralysed me for like around 8 months..!

Went to doctors, they tried everything, but literally nothing worked that great. Anyway if you have a complex ashtma like me, and if that shortness of breath is constantly interfering with your quality of life, keep reading this post, you may be able to fix your mysterious  SOB.

HOW IT ALL STARTED? :

it was around November of 2021, I was perfectly fine, one day I started having some difficulty while sleeping, my heart was also giving me very hard  bounding pulsations throughout my entire body ( not heart palpitations, heart was beating normally, just very hard, I was able to feel my heart beats throughout my body, heart rate was also normal, blood pressure was slightly elevated but not near the hypertension borderline). I thought it was due to winter and maybe my mucus was getting thick due to low moisture, I also have some post nasal drip and very bad allergy rhinitis.

WHAT WERE THE KEY SYMPTOMS? :

My ashtma was very unique, it was not bad or severe, just constant persistent shortness of breath along with some chest/ lung tightness ( I could literally feel the inflammation inside my lungs), it was pretty much all the time, and I was not having any problems during exhalation, taking in deep breath was what causing the problem, whenever I took breath It felt like it was not "" clicking"", I could feel the inflammation when I was breathing in hard, due to this I was not able to run longer or speak fluently, it dramatically affected everything in my life, it literally knocked me out.

My heart started having strong bounding pulsations, I was anxious all the time, fatigue all day, brain fog, I literally felt like killing myself.

I was also intermittent fasting, I am sure it also depleted nutritions out of my body, I lost almost 15 kgs.

MY DIAGNOSTIC JOURNEY :

I was not able to take it anymore, finally went to the doctor, and yes my lungs were only 60% open, there was 40% obstruction along with some phelpm too (spectrometry results) . Xray was normal.

My doctor gave me montelukast + budesonide 200 MCG + 6 mg formetorol for 20 days, also gave me vitamin c + zinc supplement.

 it actually worked..! Montelukast alone was capable in removing my asthma, not only that it also cured my allergy Rhinitis symptoms, I was so happy I thought I finally found the magic pill.

WHAT WENT WRONG WITH MONTELUKAST? :

initially I completely ignored the side effects of montelukast because I was happy about the fact that it cured my ashtma, and oh boy I was so wrong, IT LITERALLY KILLED ME!
I started having severe suicidal thoughts along with extreme fatigue and lethargy ( brain fog + no physical energy + severe depression + sedation + insomnia + bad mood). Basically I was dead once I started taking it, clearly I knew I had to stop it because the side effects massively outweighed the benefits, I finally gave up on it and voila, I was feeling better again, but unfortunately my ashtma and allergy symptoms returned which were equally or more unbearable.

MY PERSISTENT JOURNEY TO THE DOCTORS AND TRYING INHALERS :

went back to the doctor's, they literally did not listened to me, they said montelukast works and it does not causes any drowsiness or fatigue, and that it was just my mental thought or placebo, they again priscribed me the same drug. Which did not worked.

TRYING INHALERS :

After the initial treatment failure I went back and forced my doctor to give me some inhalers, he finally  gave me 3 inhalers.

1 sabalbuteral
2 budesonide + formoterol ( DPI +MDI with spacer)
3 fluticasone + formetorol ( DPI + MDI with spacer)

1,2 failed clearly, sabalbuteral is an SABA, it literally works for even severe attacks, I was very sad about the fact that if even sabalbuteral is not working, I thought I may have some other severe deaseses like COPD, pulmonary hypertension, alveli damage, hitial hernia or even lung cancer..!

But I was sure it is not that serious, because I am fairly young  &lt;20, no family history of lung problems, and my symptoms would sometimes get better on their own completely but only for short time.

MY SELF DIAGNOSTIC JOURNEY :

after doing it all, even going to multiple expensive cardiologists and did all heart related tests just to make sure if it was not related to heart, all the doctor's gave up on me, they said just keep on taking the INHALERS, that's all we can do at this point. 

Now I knew I must do something on my own, I started researching massively, and what I figured out is that ashtma usually causes difficulty during exhalation and not inhalation.

My my SOB was during the inhalation, I knew it was something else triggering it, it was not ashtma but some sort of immune system response to something

What I have figured it out that my persistent SOB was very complicated.

It was caused by multiple  triggers, not just one.

25% = acid reflux and gerd triggered some SOB
25% = food allergies, I am sure I am allergic to gluten and caseien ( dairy), even bananas and eggs.
25%= environmental allergens or humid weather
25% = Nutritional deficiencies.

You see, it's complicated, and this is why doctors failed because it was caused due to variety of reasons.

HOW I FIXED IT? :

It's not cured entirely, but it's 90% gone and here's what worked.

1: Fixing acid reflux and gerd, I tried all sorts of antacids but nothing worked, what worked for me is ACV ( apple cider vinegar), it sends signal to your brain to close the sphincter, where as antacids only neutralises acid which is useless in my case.

2: I started avoiding certain foods which worsened my shortness of breath like dairy, wheat gluten, even bananas and eggs. It gave some amazing results, this one was really big tbh , the real game changer

3: it was not really possible for me to avoid environmental allergens, so I keep on taking formetorol + fluticasone 150 MCG + antihistamine + steriod nasal spray to keep some symptoms in check

4 : I started fixing my Nutritional deficiencies, I started taking B vitamins, c + zinc + d3 +k2  + magnesium + pottasium + omega 3 fatty acids. I would say I am sure these helped too.

And voila, so far it's been 15 days and finally I am seeing some amazing results, it gets bad when I eat foods I am allergic to or when I have some reflux.

MY ADVICE :

Don't fall into the ashtma rabbit hole, first try to find the real root cause of your shortness of breath, diagnose it thoroughly, half assed diagnoses will give you a lot of pain, it's not that hard, all you have to do is to find the root cause, concentrate your focus on it, don't just start taking treatments without figuring out the root cause first. 

Goal is to fix the root cause, not just treat the symptoms. 

If you have any questions, let me know I'll be happy to help. 

Thanks for reading."

I had a flare up with a cold but my asthma got worse but didn't have a attack ifs been 3 weeks still have a runny nose alit of mucus from a cough I get out of breath sometimes but not like I'm struggling to breath and a but of chest pain do your lungs slowly recover from a flare up or is there something else wrong
"my family and i have a pretty strong theory that i have developed asthma, i just havent gotten in at the doctors yet. i drank some chamomile tonight and noticed my symptoms get significantly worse. i was wondering if anyone else had any experience with this?"
"Hi, I‚Äôm a 23 year old male. Have had asthma since I was a young child and have had it handled fairly well since then.

The past couple nights I have had allergy related asthma attacks that are typically controlled by regular usage of a reliever inhaler. As a result of the attacks, I have been coughing constantly which has now led into what I believe to be bronchitis. 

Tonight, I am experiencing an asthma attack once again, though the inhaler doesn‚Äôt appear to be having any effect. The ability to breathe in deeply is now gone due to the fact I instantly begin coughing and can not find a breath whatsoever. 

Just looking for any quick opinions and suggestions before I decide to phone an ambulance out. 

I‚Äôm also in the UK, where it‚Äôs half 6 in the morning and no GP‚Äôs are open as it is too early. 

Thank you!!"
I‚Äôm (20f) am literally so frustrated my asthma has been really of the past two weeks and I‚Äôm just so lost and tired. I‚Äôm taking prednisone right now 20mg One in the morning one at night. And it isn‚Äôt really helping it‚Äôs my 2nd day taking it out of my 5 day cycle. Im just so exhausted and can‚Äôt do anything and it makes me just feel so guilty and useless. I don‚Äôt wheeze my asthma for the past two years has mostly just been shortness of breath/panting whenever I feel it and I try to hold off taking albuterol as much as I can but it‚Äôs just fricken frustrating because I have to time taking it with going to bed so I can properly sleep through the night. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore the last time I went to the doctors (a week ago) she said my lungs sound good and clear but I‚Äôm here barley functioning and crying because I just wanna be able to breath normally and live my life not scared that my lungs are gunna be like this forever. I haven‚Äôt changed anything about my medicines I take 10mg montelukast and alvesco 2 puffs in the morning and 2 puffs at night and albuterol when we‚Äôre I need it which is as of right now 2-3 times a day and I‚Äôm just so exhausted from all of the anxiety and breathing problems and barley have enough energy to make myself food or do my hw. I am just so lost and confused and don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.
"Two weeks ago I was given Prednisone 40 mg a
day for ""possible"" asthma. I only took it from
Monday to Wednesday, and a 20 mg on Thursday.

and depression), insomnia, high heart rate when
go for a light run, and anxiety increases when I
have something with sugar. I have been getting

"i‚Äôm sick at the moment and my doctor thinks it may possibly be bronchitis or some sort of respiratory infection. due to finding it extremely difficult to breathe and wheezing heavily she prescribed me an inhaler (alongside antibiotics and steroids). 

the directions on the box say to ‚Äútake two puffs four times a day, when required‚Äù (the when required part is underneath the first part so i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a separate instruction?üò≠) 

i‚Äôve already taken it about 5 times in the past 20 hours (because i‚Äôve needed to) but right now i‚Äôm struggling again and want to reach for the inhaler, but i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs safe? i think this inhaler is only supposed to be short-term as i haven‚Äôt shown any asthma symptoms since i was about 6 (i‚Äôm 21 now). can anyone tell me if it‚Äôs okay to take it or should i just soldier through it and take it tomorrow? will my breathing get worse if i don‚Äôt take it now? 

(it‚Äôs 2am so i can‚Äôt contact my doctor rn and can‚Äôt find anything online)"
"Finally got into the allergist today for the first time in ten years. First, I have to say how annoyed I am with how hard it is to find a doctor who LISTENS. I explicitly told the nurse during intake that I stopped taking Symbicort because I had fewer asthma attacks, yes, but when I did have an attack, it was so much worse and would lead to days of terrible symptoms. At first, I was feeling good because I really felt like the nurse was listening. About 10 minutes later, I heard her and the doctor outside my room talking and making fun of the fact that I am not on a controller medication - when I had JUST told her why I stopped taking my controller in the first place. WHY, oh why, do doctors think that you can't hear them through those thin little doors? 

Even though we got off to a rough start, the rest of the appointment was okay; nothing super unexpected from the allergy test results, just some super itchy welts on my back. The doctor ended up prescribing Breo Ellipta. I sat down at home to read over the drug facts, and the packet notes you shouldn't take Breo if you're allergic to milk. So, riddle me this - WHY did the doctor prescribe Breo when he had JUST finished a scratch test that confirmed a milk allergy? Now I am stuck - on my own, again, trying to figure out if I should take this drug or not. There's also some indications that Breo can interact negatively with drugs like Zoloft and cause heart palpitations - again, WHY prescribe Breo when you can clearly see my medication list on my chart, PLUS my pre-existing heart issues listed right there? I honestly don't understand doctors sometimes. Am I overlooking something here? Does anyone have a thought on comprehending this doctor's thought process? He seemed competent and kind, so I am trying to figure out if he's off the rails or I am."
"Now, please don't downvote me but here's my story.

You all probably recognize me from all the posts Ive made here and Ive came a long way. I was controlled on the lowest dose of Asmanex for 5-ish years, but spring this year, that stopped working, we upped asmanex to the max dose, that did not work, then we tried symbicort. Turns out, symbicort's ICS does not work for me AT ALL and it oddly worked for 2 days really well, until it went progressively downward to the point it felt like I was getting no steroid whatsoever, and I landed in the emergency room, and was prescribed 5 days of 20 mg prednisone.

Since then, my allergist switched me to Advair HFA max dose, and thats really helped, I've been on it approximately 3 weeks now, and I feel asthma slowly going down and I use rescue max once daily (there's still lots of inflammation, and when its a cold days here, I cough a lot still). So my parents are, rightfully scared, and keep telling me on how I should supplement this by going to India and trying some natural treatments along with my current Advair dosage to bring down my asthma intensity.

What their claim basically is, is that, now Im on the top of the asthma ladder for meds, and I am thankful I found something that finally seems to be bringing my asthma down (went from nebulizing 2 times a day along with ventolins as well to now max 1-2 puffs of ventolin a day, but I still am coughing and what not), but they say, if down the line, advair hfa (or flovent hfa, it seems like the new steroid is the one doing the magic), does not work (like what happened with asmanex), then Im absolutely fucked, and Im going to die.

They basically claim, these natural treatments will rid my body of the ""toxins"" and decrease my asthma intensity. Is there any merit to what they say? Is this something I should try going to India for and doing (have any of you had success with it?) or is it best I stay here and stick it out with advair or flovent?

Thanks."
"My lungs have been hurting for like 5 days, and my inhaler wasn‚Äôt curing it, felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe sometimes. Long story short, I opened my inhaler today to find a ton of dust buildup in the hole where the medicine shoots out of. Remember to check ur inhaler folks!"
"Now, I might sound a little too logical here, but what causes asthma? Tightened airways, mucus, sure, but what causes THOSE? Are my past suicidal thoughts turning biological?

See, I'm a very fit young man. I don't have a raging six pack, but that doesn't mean I'm unfit. I can cycle at 40km/hr constantly with nearly no breaks, I can do 43 pushups in a row, I can do 22 pullups, etc etc etc

So, why in the fuck? Why in the fuck do I have chest tightness and the most pathetic breathing possible? Either this is a simple viral which I'm exaggerating, or this is the end of all the stuff I could do to impress my friends.

PS: I really wish I could go to the doctor. Don't ask me why, because the reason is pathetic. Seriously, don't.

Some ""home"" methods to improve my condition would be appreciated."
"Hey guys. I‚Äôm a 24F and have been struggling with asthma pretty much since birth. It‚Äôs been on and off ‚Äòwell controlled‚Äô throughout the years. However, in the last 2 years it‚Äôs dramatically worsened. I don‚Äôt often have an asthma attack like I used to when I was younger, but I‚Äôve found myself needing to use Albuterol around 4-6 times a day, despite taking a preventative steroid inhaler. Whenever I have an asthma review with the doctor they panic when I tell them how often I have to use the Albuterol and state I‚Äôm on an extremely high dose of the steroid inhaler and this shouldn‚Äôt be happening. I never know how to respond to this as I do what I‚Äôm advised to and take the Albuterol only whenever I need it which does appear to be several times a day. It‚Äôs really panicking me lately about how often I‚Äôm taking it. I‚Äôve even tried to hold off for an hour or so when I get the feeling I need it to see if it goes away on it‚Äôs own, and it doesn‚Äôt. Does anyone else have this problem as I feel so alone, misadvised and worried about my condition?"
"Hi fellow asthma sufferers. For a little background about myself, I'm a 27 year old lifelong asthmatic. The past few years my asthma has mostly been under control. With that said, I've also been extremely triggered by animal hair. ESPECIALLY cat hair.  

Two weeks ago I moved into a new apartment and it's driving me crazy. It's an upper floor duplex (600sqft) that sits above another unit on the bottom floor. The person who lives below me has a cat. I knew that when I signed the rental agreement. The landlord assured me the ducts are separate and we wouldn't be sharing any air.  Unfortunately, I later found out the past tenant who lived in my apartment also had a cat.  I learned this fact after I signed the rental agreement. 

My asthma has flared up since the first night I've been here. It's now been 2 weeks and it's not getting any better. I've used my inhaler so many times that it's completely out of juice. 

Last week I had a professional cleaner come in to do a deep clean, I bought a HEPA air purifier, and covered all the ducts with cloth filters. 

None of that has helped the situation. I'm still waking up with asthma. I work from home too so that doesn't help either. 

I don't know what else to do. The entire apartment is floor with the exception of the stairs, which has carpet on them. 

Is there anything I can do or should I just moved out? I'm locked into a 12 month rental agreement so moving out isn't exactly easy. 

Should I call my landlord and see if he'll pay to have the ducts cleaned? Should I get the carpet on the stairs professionally cleaned again? 

I really need help guys. I feel like I'm running out of options. 

Thanks."
Can upping the dose from 5mg to 10mg cause new side effects I know this meds is bad as of side effects like suicidal thoughts and depression stuff lile that iv been on 5 for years now going up would I get new side effects from it I never had side effects on 5mg
Hey everybody! I‚Äôm 24 F and my asthma wasn‚Äôt bad until after I turned 18. I‚Äôve been on regular albuterol for 3+ years and got Dulera sometime end of last year. However starting may this year I have had horrible hormonal acne and I don‚Äôt understand what it could be but now I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs the dulera. But it has helped my lungs a lot. :(
"If Pulmicort doesn‚Äôt really improve my overall feeling like chest pain and burning feeling when breathing in, does it mean I don‚Äôt have Asthma ? Currently in process of diagnosis‚Ä¶ or a re there alternatives to Pulmicort that could work for me. Because wenn I use Salbutamol it improves my breathing a lot."
I recently got diagnosed with eib and my doctor said not to use the inhaler everyday so do I only use it when I really have trouble breathing or just don‚Äôt workout everyday? I asked but I don‚Äôt think she really understood my question haha
"I'm trying to figure out the right term for what I've been feeling lately, but I can't quite touch on the correct term so that I can accurately describe it to my doctor. The first thing that comes to mind is, ""my lungs hurt"", but hurt isn't right, but it's not entirely incorrect either. They don't feel like what I would describe as tight, it's more a feeling of heaviness or heat, or soreness. I don't have trouble expanding or contracting my lungs. If you've ever breathed in too much smoke being near a camp fire, or too much solvent, but without the stinging, it's more dull. 

Asthma is too common for it to be unique to me, so I wanted to see if there was a common term people used when describing this."
"Do, any of you fine young gentleman/gentle ladies get pet hair in your inhaler? I do, is there anyway to prevent it? i keep my inhaler in my pocket and usually never take it out except when I need it. but it seems every time it shoots pet hairs into my mouth every time and makes me gag. any fixes other than maybe cleaning before every use? cant exactly predict when I need to use it."
"Some of you may already know this. Apologies for posting this if you already do, but I‚Äôve been an asthmatic for 34 years and I never did!

This revelation comes after weeks of me not believing my own symptoms, and gaslighting myself into thinking I was fine.

I basically just went to one of the best lung specialist doctors in London after weeks of chest pain, coughing, waking up at night, wheezing, and weirdly, consistently normal peak flow numbers.

After some tests, the doctor said my asthma was poorly managed. I brought up my peak flow results with him- that I test it every day, I test it when I feel crap, and I‚Äôm always in my 90% zone. How can it be poorly managed?

He said if you‚Äôre young and fit then you often can produce normal peak flow numbers. And that while a meter can be really useful as a diagnostic tool, it‚Äôs not reliable for everyone.

I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this, but I basically kept talking myself out of going to the doctor everyday for the last month because I kept getting normal peak flow numbers and thinking, ‚Äúwell my asthma is not that bad‚Äù (!)"
"Ive been feeling mucus way down in my throat, under the adams apple, and i cant clear it out, constant coughing and throat clearing.  

I have albuterol, but it doesnt do anything, ive taken 2 puff doses multiple times. 

Also, my peak flow numbers are all normal.  

My lungs feel clear and no pain either"
"I've been avoiding using my inhaler cause it makes me really shaky, is there any medicine out there that doesn't do this?"
"i was diagnosed when i was really young they made me blow in this thing and this line measured it . so my dr explained the results to my mom and he said the next time i came in he wanted to see improvement and he pointed to a certain number where i SHOULD be at ( after putting me on advair and this whole regimine thing ) so reason im kinda freaking out now is my aunt got covid so now i know the virus isnt something to mess with . so im scared , recently i had this crazy flare up , put on flovant fha 250 and airomir  as a reliever and im wondering if anyone had breathing test results below what the normal should be"
I need major help/advice. Starting today I am supposed to be taking 20mg prednisone one in the morning on at night for the next 5 days (40mg a day) and I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôve only ever taken prednisone when I‚Äôve been in the emergency room for asthma attacks so this is kind of new to me and everything I‚Äôve been reading about it is scaring the absolute shit out of me. I have been breathing fast for a week and a half and I‚Äôve been taking all my normal medications correctly but nothing seems to really help me after the four hours are up after taking my rescue inhaler so the doctor recommended this. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions or stories about prednisone before I start taking it. Also I‚Äôm very concerned that after the 5 days are up the effect of the medication is gunna completely leave my body and I‚Äôll just be right back to square one. Some PLEASE HELP ME TRULY ANY STORIES REASSURANCE OR SUGGESTIONS HELP!

"anyone with anxiety/ panic disorder suffer with asthma here ? it‚Äôs really difficult to differentiate my shortness of breath‚Äôs cause ; anxiety or asthma. my doctor had a look at my lungs and said yeah every thing is fine they work how they should , but my anxiety makes me feel these chest pains/ compression feeling, back aches when i breathe in deep, and shortness of breath. it‚Äôs really difficult to manage. also Albuterol treatments like with the mask and everything make my anxiety skyrocket and i turn into an anxious, shaky mess after each treatment."

"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/pjrs06/i_think_i_developed_allergyinduced_asthma_as_an/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

I made my first post here a few weeks ago seeking advice after I developed symptoms that strongly suggested allergy related asthma. 

I‚Äôm still waiting on an appointment with my primary care doctor which I‚Äôm planning on addressing this. However, a few days ago my breathing symptoms got to the point where I concluded I needed to go to urgent care.

I was coughing, wheezing, couldn‚Äôt get a full sentence out without getting winded. It was all the same symptoms I had been getting except much worse. It was so hard to stay calm and not panic. Luckily the wait time to be seen was way shorter than what is typical for urgent care clinics in my experience.  

The doctor I saw was excellent. She did all the standard respiratory exams and ordered a chest x-ray to rule out other causes. The X-ray was normal but she noted wheezing on auscultation (plus being able to visibly see I was struggling to breathe). She told me that they can‚Äôt make an official diagnosis in urgent care, but that my symptoms were consistent enough with an asthma attack that they were going to treat it that way.

They set me up on a nebulizer with albuterol while still in the clinic. It ended up helping a ton and I was so relieved to at least be able to catch my breath. I was still having mild symptoms afterwards but totally manageable.

The doctor ended up prescribing me an albuterol inhaler for acute symptoms and a 6 day course of prednisone. She also recommended going to the ER if I get a similar or worse episode that doesn‚Äôt go away, as well as making sure to follow up about this at my primary care doctor appointment next week.

I‚Äôve been on the prednisone for 5 days now and I‚Äôve definitely noticed a huge improvement. I‚Äôve only had to use the inhaler twice so far and overall I feel great! Making the decision to go to urgent care was absolutely the right course of action.

I know I‚Äôm going to need further testing in order to get an official diagnosis, but for now I just feel extremely relieved to have gotten medication that helps."
Does asthma get better after lying down? I also feel something triggering in my throat like it being dry.
"Hi everyone, first time on the forum and really hoping for some support or advice.

My fiance started showing her typical asthma flare ups she gets in mid September through October.

Typically, while not fun, these do go away eventually with steroids and inhalers and have never gotten serious.

This year, things escalated much worse than ever before. Even after a week of ramped up treatment, we had an ER visit followed by another one 2 days later, where she was hospitalized for 4 days.

She has improved, but very slowly, and a week later now we are seeing more mild flare ups as we ween off of steroids. She is on 6 hour duonebs, xopenex as needed, prednisone, all her regular inhalers and allergy meds.

We want to start Xolair but know it won't really give us short term relief.

Our lives are fairly consumed at this point with worry and anxiety, which of course just makes things worse. We don't know if or when we will need to make another scary trip to the hospital, its a terrifying experience and we did it 2 times in 3 days. We keep thinking we are out of the woods but then we always get another little flare up that has us on pins and needles. 

Anyone with similar experiences able to share how they were able to get better? Sounds like we are going back up on steroids today. We know we need to be patient but this is really taking its toll on us mentally.

She was up to 60 mils of prednisone at the worst of it. We started noticing her heading in the wrong direction again once we weened it from 40 to 20. One of the hardest parts about this is family and friends not understanding how difficult this has been for us."
"I am a pretty healthy person besides having asthma since a kid. I have acute. My trigger is smoke and have been getting random flair ups on a yearly timeframe whenever I am partying with weed with friends too much or the air outside quality is bad. 

Right now, I have been doing my rescue like 3x a day for a week which never happens usually because of flair up. I renewed my alvesco preventative and been on that as well for like 3 weeks now. I went to a concert in SF and once I got back was coughing up mucus for like a week in the mornings but no trouble breathing. Now I can inhale deeply no problem but when rescue inhaler wears off the exhale gets a little crackly. I still am coughing up mucus in mornings but it is clear and I feel better after showering. 

I called kaiser today and they are frustrating putting me on video calls and I missed it because have to download app and all this but they wouldnt even be able to hear my breathing. 

I am wondering if anyone could offer some comforting advice if I should just ride this out or call again for appointment or go to urgent care for a steroid shot maybe to just get me back to normal quick? I have done that once before years ago and it worked pretty well but I am not sure if it is safe for my body 

Just not sure if doctor can even tell me to do anything else besides keep using albuterol for relief, avoid triggers, drink fluids, and keep up on everything preventative.... 

Anything is much appreciated thanks &lt;3"

Does anyones doctor every ask questions or give advice about diet changes that would help asthma or do they just give medications to control the symptoms?
"Hi all . Hoping for a bit of advice from fellow 'sufferers' 

I had ashma pretty bad as a child but as I got older it lay dormant for about 15 years. In the past 8 months its returned with a vengeance worse than I ever had as a child. 

I'm on anasma as preventer &amp; ventolin as rescue &amp; antihistamines but still easily using my rescue up to 4 times a day. I wheeze pretty much constantly and spend a fair amount of time every day trying to force a yawn to take a satisfied breath. Working out has become almost impossible so the weight is piling on making it all so much worse. 

Had an IGE total which came back at 196.2 - does anybody have any experience with the results of these tests?

I guess I'm looking for some advice as I pretty much have to rely on rescue every day &amp; from being a child I can't remember if this is just how life is going to be and it just always feels like this or if I should nudge my Dr to keep adjusting til it feels more controlled? 

Thanks in advance!"

"Hi,
I'm still new to all of this. Got diagnosed last June. I mostly have exercise induced asthma (EIB) with occasional nighttime symptoms and some ""bad days"" from time to time. 
I take Fostair as a preventer and Salbutamol as reliever. 
Obviously I take my reliever before exercise the way I have been told, however I do sometimes get a little SOB, sometimes with a little wheeze, which goes away on its own after some time, or almost immediately after taking the SABA. And that's the tricky part.
I'm still unsure when to use my SABA. At the beginning of any kind of symptom coming on (that would be quite a lot) 
or just in case of emergency (when symptoms do not go away in any reasonable amount of time or they prevent me from doing what I want to do...)

I know I should tell my doctor about all this and he'll tell me what to do or adjust my meds, but the appointment I have coming up won't be before the end of November.

Just wanted to ask about your experience and mostly when (in what kind of situation) you take your SABA."
"Hi, looking for advices!

I have very mild asthma since i was a baby, like in my childhood i can remember like 3 or 4 asthma attacks. But since like 3 weeks, I have been feeling some kind of oppression in my chest, difficulty to breath in completely, and shortness of breath, to the point that I have troubles falling asleep.

I saw a doctor, she said that it may be asthma but she's not sure. She gave me medication for this, and I'm glad she did because I had a real asthma attack last night.

I'm 21, I've been smoking for the past 5 years but I always did physical activity, and everything was fine. 

Can asthma kick in in adulthood for no reason?

Thank you"

"I have had fitness trackers with SpO2 measurement for a few years (note: no asthma diagnosis yet, but currently under examinations). The trackers have consistently shown reduced SpO2 numbers for me, while my spouse has recorded almost perfect scores (we even switched bands to verify that it's not a broken band, it's really me). It was more of an inside joke for us, since my original band (leaving out the brand as I don't know if you are allowed to mention them!) kept telling me to lose weight and stop smoking, and I was more close to being underweight and certainly did not smoke. Now I've moved to another brand, and it also shows that I often have periods of lower SpO2 numbers during night.

Due to other health issues I ended up being examined for asthma. My 2 week PEF measurement is still ongoing, but the response I'm showing for the inhalator looks to indicate asthma. During this PEF measurement period I have noticed that I have mornings when my PEF is quite low and I have good response to the inhalator. During the previous nights my activity band shows lower SpO2 values. I have also had mornings with better PEF measurements and not as much response to the inhalator - these nights I have had higher SpO2 values. I am now also able to track back to a few times when I had bad breathing issues, and see that I was showing bad SpO2 values the previous night.

I know this is anecdotial at best at this stage - but since the correlation is so strong in me, I'd like to hear if anyone else has seen similar reaults? If there is such a strong link, how has this not been utilised more strongly in asthma treatment yet?"

"hey, new here. my asthma has been very controlled my entire life. at times i‚Äôve questioned if i even have asthma. but of course i do the breathing test and it shows thats i do have it. so my doctor told me to consistently take ‚ÄúBreo‚Äù once a day for a couple months and then we‚Äôll test my lungs again to see how they‚Äôre doing. however, i‚Äôve been taking it for a week and my lungs feel weird. they feel dense. and at times i‚Äôll even have a cough that seems to come out of no where. should i be concerned? should i stop taking it? or is this my lungs getting adjusted to it? 

also, i‚Äôve tested negative for covid in the past week so i‚Äôve ruled that out as well. 

thanks in advance to anyone willing to respond."
Has anyone here tried an air purifier to help with symptoms? Does it work well? And what brand do you have? I‚Äôm looking at some online but they‚Äôre either insanely expensive or their have no reviews
"I‚Äôve been noticing the past few times I‚Äôve drank that my chest gets a really uncomfortable tight feeling. I literally just took a shot of vodka and as soon as I started to feel it a bit, I got a super tight feeling in my chest and it just ruins the fun for me everytime. Anyone else get this and know why? Can I just not drink anymore?"

"I'm suffering through a flare up that came on in July (cold induced). My asthma is mainly nocturnal. In the evening my breathing starts to get a bit laboured, then if I lay down to sleep it kicks off. I use Ventolin and sit up when I'm wheezing. I basically wait it out until about 5am. My breathing will start to feel more comfortable or I'll just collapse and sleep for a couple hours.

I'm basically at the end of my tether and am considering dropping some money on an air purifier. Has anyone's nocturnal asthma responded well to one?"
"I exersise, I eat well, I meditate, I sleep enough, I stay hydrated, but the odd time I just dont catch it and have an asthma attack., like if there is an emotional blow-up at home, and it just kicks in like super fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

This time I was coughing up like large amount of phlem, like more than I thought was humanly possible and was able to get it out but still used my rescue inhaler (salbutamal) just incase. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this like a querstion for my therapist?"
"Hi everyone,

I developed a dry cough 6 days ago. I adopted a poodle on Sunday. Immediately thought of allergic asthma, but could also be a cold. Saw a doctor 2 days ago, and she doesn't think its allergic asthma based on the lack of any eye itchiness, sneezing, etc. Did have a bit of a wheeze on examination when doing quick exhales. Doc prescribed albuterol for temporary assistance. I take every 3-4 hours. Since then, my cough hasn't relented but has turned into a productive wet cough with some yellow phlegm. No fever, no aches/pain. Still no itchiness, sneezing, etc.

I'm wondering if any of y'all with allergic asthma only get coughs? And does albuterol eliminate your cough? I am speaking with doc again on Monday.

Other info, dog is contained to the downstairs area, and bedrooms are upstairs. No carpet downstairs."
"I moved into a flat a few months ago, the bedroom has a small en-suite bathroom and the doorway is literally one step from my bed/head.  I haven‚Äôt had asthma for years.  I haven‚Äôt slept well since I moved in and now I‚Äôve got a lot of shortness of breath and a recurring chest infection I can‚Äôt get rid of.  I‚Äôve now realised that I possibly wasn‚Äôt sleeping due to some asthma.  Could it be the bathroom- it‚Äôs an internal room with no window and the extractor fan isn‚Äôt working.  There‚Äôs also a tiny bit of mould and I have always been sensitive to mould.  Many thanks"

"I have had asthma for the past 12 years (currently 14) and I have to take medicines like Singulair(Montelukast) daily and stuff. And Recently from the past few months, breathing feels a little weird like inflammation or something, it isn't an asthma attack, to be honest, but feels very annoying and also reduces my stamina than what normally is even after asthma  
ALSO, inhaler doesn't do much to my asthma attacks like it used to. I have to rest for a really long time after taking a puff or two to get the asthma attack go away unlike it used to happen in a few minutes"
"I developed asthma in my late teens by living in dorms with mold infestation. Since then I‚Äôve had to use my inhaler every spring daily and then normal times can go every few days. To make it worse I‚Äôm a smoker and weed helps me manage all my other issues (seizures, anxiety, not eating food normally). I currently have a cold and an coughing a lot from it, this morning I coughed up a little blood in my mucus. Every time I‚Äôve gone to a dr for this they dismiss me. 

Has anyone else coughed blood when sick from excessive coughing? What did your doctors do for you?"
"So, Im a 21 year old girl. I'm a medical student and i just realized that whenever the examination is coming (which is every months), i will have a non purulent cough. Its just uhuk uhuk uhuk literally everytime and it will disappear after the examination ( abt 1 week) without any medication.  It kinds of annoyed me especially during examination when i need to sit in a hall and my cough may disturb other people. I have eczema/ dermatitis when16 y.o and my lecturer ( who are a doctor) said that i may have a stress induce asthma. 

Is there any of you having the same problem and do you think this is asthma?"
"When were you did you get it? How long has it been? Did it get better/worse? Have the duration/frequency of attacks changed? Did you change your cute a lot? Which things were the key to make your asthma better? 



I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 14, I‚Äôm 23F now and I still feel like I‚Äôm trying to understand my asthma everyday. I started taking regular medication at my first attack, always got checked by lung specialists and never smoked in my life, so let‚Äôs say I‚Äôve been trying to do the best generally, but even though my asthma is pretty under control during everyday life, when I get flare ups after colds those are still terrible, asthma attacks everyday and it takes weeks if not more than a month to recover. So now I‚Äôll try biologic. But I was curious on what helped you guys and also if I need to worry for the future or if I have hope to feel better as the years go by. 

Thank you all!"
like i mean this has been a thing with me since i was really young i would laugh at really stupid stuff and be really wired im just wondering if im the only one ü•≤
"i use the basic blue/green one. ive been using it for years, i get asthma attacks once every week and a halfish, i find them to be super bad, and im not sure if my puffer doesnt much. it used to work fine, id take 4-6 puffs at a time. now i find myself needing 12 to get any results. im left with side effects like a tight chest, dizzy cloud like feeling and shaking. i think its a false adrenaline rush. alot of the times i chose waiting for it to over.

i went to a doctor with these concerns and she just told me to use it before exercising.. (i do.)

what should i do? find a new doctor? or am i overreacting?"
"I have a Symbicort turbuhaler I use that I got prescribed for mild asthma/a dry cough. Because of my dry cough and my airway being irritable, I can't breathe deeply with the inhaler without coughing it up. Would using a spacer help me breathe in all of the inhaler without coughing? Am I even able to use a spacer with the [Turbuhaler](https://www.healthywa.wa.gov.au/~/media/Images/HealthyWA/Articles/Asthma/turbuhaler02.jpg)? Every image I see of a spacer is used on a different type of inhaler, the ones where you squeeze the top."
"Okay so, I‚Äôve restarted smoking cigarettes again (I know bad bad bad) since a couple of months, and today i had a really bad and sudden asthma attack during the night, I was diagnosed with asthma when I was younger, but I never had an attack until today, i was wondering,did this happens to any of you? What can I do ?"

"I believe I have very mild asthma, considering it only triggers if I laugh too hard for too long or run at a fast pace. Despite this, I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôll be DQed from the US military because of it. Does anyone know of ways to get it under control so that I can pass the Methacholine Test? I would guess by training my running, but any other tips? Medication and inhalers aren‚Äôt an option."
"Is it dangerous to use an expired inhaler? If not, does the expiration date mean anything of note to me?"
"Two weeks ago to the day, while exercising, I noticed that I started sighing and yawning constantly. Since then, I have had to do that every 2-3 minutes without fail. Always gasping for a bit more fulfilling breath. I have also had a lot of chest pain and tightness (in the back and arms as well) intermittent throughout the past two weeks. When I was exercising after these symptoms developed (and before I stopped after the sudden chest pain),  I had no issue catching my breath.

Nighttime before bed is the worst (with a runny nose) and waking up is generally the time where I have no issues.

Pulmonologist wants to check for asthma as CT shows it's not an embolism or pneumonia. Had asthma as a kid, but have not had any breathing issues for 16+ years until this random thing.

Anyone experience this? The fact that this has been happening all day, every day for weeks makes me think probably not asthma and more than likely something with my heart."
"Hi! So i used my inhaler just a few moments ago and forgot i hadn‚Äôt needed to use it in a few weeks. Normally I remember to prep it by spraying a few times before actually inhaling it. However, this time I forgot to do that and didn‚Äôt realize until my second puff felt a bit off. Was it dangerous to do this if it had been sitting for quite a while?"
"Out of no where I seem to have heart palpitations, chest tightness, and really bad anxiety. My heart  wakes me up from  my sleep and I have nightmares. I had a coughing fit the other day and couldn't breathe, along with chest pain so I went to the ER. They said everything looks good except I probably have a virus that caused my asthma to flare up. Prednisone is helping but everytime I take one of my inhalers I feel the panic again. It's a really weird panic and I really don't feel like myself at all. So my PCP switched me to Breo. I just picked it up last night but I'm so scared to take anything now. Has this happened to anyone else?"
"Do you get out of breath easily, for example when walking up the stairs? I walk up the stairs daily but I am out of breath every time"
"Hey all! I‚Äôve had severe asthma since I was about 8 years old (I‚Äôm 20 now). It was pretty bad and I ended up in the ICU in the hospital for a couple of weeks for my first attack when I was 8. It hasn‚Äôt been nearly as bad since then and is way more controlled now. I also have an autoimmune problem, my immune system is attacking my brain and spinal cord making them inflamed. So yeah, I‚Äôm pretty high risk for Covid. I received one dose of the pfizer vaccine but couldn‚Äôt receive my second as my immune system started doing what it‚Äôs doing. So not only am i high risk, I‚Äôm not fully vaccinated and that kind of worries me. I‚Äôm not as worried for my autoimmune problem than I am my asthma though. 

I don‚Äôt really see anyone besides my doctors. A couple of weeks ago I did go to the hospital. And I had Covid-like symptoms start about 4 days ago. So I‚Äôm worried I got it from the hospital. At first I just thought I was having an asthma flare up. I‚Äôve been waking up every morning not being able to breathe and having to take my inhaler. And i‚Äôve been having to take it more throughout the day. Same thing today but the only difference, I not only woke up not being able to breathe, I woke up feeling sick. Nose super congested, sore throat, and that overall sick feeling. I scheduled a test for tomorrow so hopefully it comes back negative and these are just some nasty fall time allergies. I‚Äôm more concerned about my breathing more than anything. I just took a super long nap and I kept jolting awake and having to take my inhaler. I have an apple watch and check my blood oxygen on that and it‚Äôs seems pretty okay. Sometimes a little lower than usual but still in that healthy range. But I‚Äôm not too sure how accurate these watches are. 

If any of you had COVID, how did it affect your asthma? How did you feel? Thank you."
"I was just diagnosed with asthma within the last month. I am 24. Vaped for a couple years, but the docs don‚Äôt really seem to think that had much to do with me developing asthma. Not sure what caused it‚Ä¶ I know some members of my family has asthma so maybe it‚Äôs just a family thing? Anyways, I am on Breo Ellipta once a day and that seems to finally be helping. It took about ten days before I noticed a real improvement. I have shortness of breath pretty constantly through out the day and haven‚Äôt been able to tell if I have triggers that may it worse‚Ä¶. Doc said I only had ‚Äúmild asthma.‚Äù Anyways my real question is that sometimes when asthma is bad I‚Äôll take a tums or two and that will actually make my asthma feel better. Is this a real thing or just a placebo effect? Thank you!"
"I‚Äôm 23F, been diagnosed with moderate asthma 8 years ago. My asthma works like this: when I get colds or flu I have really bad flare ups that last from 2 weeks to a month, during these I have really bad attacks, I try to manage with cortisone (prednisone and others), my inhaler and my basic treatment that I take all year around (ellipta and antihistamines) but sometimes it‚Äôs so bad that I have to go to the ER.

But, when these flare ups end, my life is almost as if I don‚Äôt have asthma at all, I never had sport induced asthma, even when I‚Äôm around my allergens (dust mites and graminaceae) I usually never have attacks and so on. 

So what‚Äôs the problem now? The past two years have been different, during allergic times (autumn and spring for me) I‚Äôve had this bad sinusitis, nose clogged, mucus in both my nose and throat (white mucus) and so on. But my chest SEEMS to be ok. But since I can‚Äôt breath properly, I end up feeling like I can‚Äôt catch my breath overall and feeling really really frustrated. I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôll be having asthma or not, and this is making me extremely anxious. This has been my past month, I had a really bad flare up in September, and when I thought I had recovered this allergic (I suppose) sinusitis came. 

The reason why I said my chest SEEMS fine is because after this terrible month I have had bad anxiety, so I genuinely can‚Äôt distinguish anxiety induced chest heavy feelings with mild asthma feelings. It just sucks. The side effects from the cortisone have been so bad the past month that I‚Äôve had near to life ending thoughts. I also got ptsd from the whole thing, I‚Äôm just so scared of the idea of asthma changing and getting worse, it‚Äôs been taking up too much of my brain capacity lately.

Im gonna go see a new and supposedly really really good plumo on Tuesday, and ask for biologic since my eosinophils have gone up and the flare ups have been a nightmare, hopefully I will also get montelukast prescribed to manage the allergic part of the asthma. Im really praying these new meds will be a game changer because I need something to scream ‚ÄúGOOD NEWS, HOPE‚Äù into my face really really hard.


Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart to anyone reading and replying."

"Hello! To keep it as short as possible, A few months ago I transitioned to Trelegy Elipta and my lungs have not felt this great in years! I was diagnosed with allergic asthma at age 32 and I‚Äôm now 36. I also break out in hives randomly so my allergist recommended Xolair. I was just approved and had my first injection on Tuesday and ever since then my lungs have been burning like they did before I was diagnosed with asthma, and how I felt going through so many trial and error phases of corticosteroid inhaler‚Äôs. 

Is this something anyone on this forum using Xolair has experienced and if so did it go away or did you end up discontinuing the injections? 

Any advice? 

I told the nurse after my three hour wait on Tuesday that I had some burning in my chest and she chalked it up to nerves and anxiety over getting the injection because of the possible side effects.  I‚Äôm starting to think it was not just my nerves and it‚Äôs actually causing the irritation. 

Thanks!"
Hi. so i just got a asthma medication called ventoline and sometimes I feel like i didnt take it properly.. is it ok if I inhale it again to get enough of it

"So I‚Äôve had my first asthma attack at the grand old age of 27‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve only been diagnosed a year and am starting to think the fumes from the bleach I used, combined with hairspray triggered an asthma attack, is this a thing?"
"Bit of background: Never ever had any chest issues up until 2 years ago, I'm 27 now male. I am about 30kg overweight though which I have picked up in those years.

 So when I laugh intensely I cough, after running around outside I cough afterwards a bit. Sometimes I wake up with a chesty feeling. No real issues breathing. When I have hay-fever half the time I get a bit chesty and coughy the other half of the time I don't. I'm seeing an asmtha nurse in a week what kind of asmtha am I likely to have? If any? Also some encouragement would be appreciated. Thank you all. Have a good day."
"I cough and have coughed just about ever day in my memory. Now that school and life is starting to get back to normal, I'm feeling self conscious of my coughing from asthma. 

Looked at the list of covid symptoms, and between my asthma and ibs, I basically have all the covid symptoms from one of those or a side effect of some medication I'm on. Ugg."
"Brief background: I probably had some level of asthma throughout most of my life upon retrospect but an event happened a few months ago which damaged my lungs to the point where I now need to use asthma inhalers daily.  This is all brand new to me and it can feel overwhelming.

I feel afraid because I'm so new to all this.  I recently had to go to an urgent care because of a persistent asthma which wouldn't subside with my inhaler.  Additionally, my asthma is still not managed well enough and I often struggle to get more than 6 hours of sleep because I wake up in the night with breathing problems (I also use a CPAP machine because I have sleep apnea and using it if my asthma is flared up is very challenging).  

How long did it take you to get your asthma relatively under control?  Do you have any advice or words of comfort to someone who is new to this and afraid?  Thank you."
"Has anyone experience of this steroid? 
I've been put on 40mg for 5 days . Overall greatly improved my asthma but significantly worsened my GERD. Will my asthma deteriorate after stopping this medication?"
This is the worst medication I've ever had to endure. The taste alone is unbelievably acrid and then there's that horrible after taste. I hate prednisolone.


is random upper back aches a symtom of asthma? also for those on advair how bad were your side effects if any? I was really jittery into my second dose last night. added anxiety and tightness today. my therapist today said shakes and what not can happen with advair. I get myself worked up worrying and end up hyperventilating. I don't like the feeling that I get where feels like throat gets tight also

"Been going on for weeks now. My Medicaid is pending approval, so a doctor is not an option just yet. I have Ipratropium Bromide and my Albuterol pump and the albuterol alone does not help me, I have to combine these two or take one immediately after the other at least 2-4 times a day because my breathing is constantly becoming ‚ÄúBubbly‚Äù and I have to constantly huff and cough until it comes out, only for more to develop 30 seconds later. Its fucking up my quality of life so bad right now and I‚Äôve never had this happen ever. Anyone else experienced the same thing?"
"Hi all, got asthma 4 months ago from Covid and haven‚Äôt experienced my first cold yet. Given that we‚Äôre entering cold / flu season, just wanted to see how colds have affected your asthma to get a better sense of what to expect and how I can prepare.

Thank you!!"
"my asthma only recently came back last year so i have no clue what is normal or not normal. i had asthma up until the age of 6 and then it ‚Äúwent away‚Äù - was told it‚Äôd never come back but clearly not haha.

this is probs the worst flare-up i‚Äôve had since it came back. brought on by a beta blocker i am no longer taking. i went to urgent care yesterday for a nebulizer treatment; helped me to get a mostly full breath, but didn‚Äôt touch the chest pain. upper chest, below the collarbone. and tbh my back hurts too, upper back. and it‚Äôs like bad pain. i can still mostly take a full breath now the morning after but it takes focus and effort and most importantly, it hurts. my mom said it‚Äôs probably just my muscles sore from the flare-up but idek.

usually when my chest hurts like this i‚Äôd use my inhaler but the urgent care doctor said to use it only when i‚Äôm coughing/wheezing or struggling to breathe (i kinda am still so i might) so now i‚Äôm just like ?? is this normal ??"
"I'm not sure to what extent they can get this stuff out of my ducts but now with the dust flying all over the place, I definitely cannot use the HVAC system. In the worst case scenario that they cannot do much beyond what they have done, are there any solutions anyone has for this case?

Have you ever dealt with this type of solution? Are there any heavy duty pads I could place on my ducts to stop the small particled dust from entering? I'm dying :("

"Hello. Myself and my girlfriend recently bought a new home and lived in it during the summer with no issues. We recently turned on the heaters (old radiators) and I have been struggling to breath even at night when it‚Äôs turned off.

I am now sleeping with the window open at night and vacuuming more regularly. But I am worried it could be something else more than dust. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I cannot sleep well at night."
Does anyone else not really wheeze from there asthma but rather feel as if they are taking laboured breaths and just feel as if they are breathing heavy? For the past week and a half I‚Äôve been feeling this and my inhalers help it a good amount but when I went to the doctors she says my lungs sound clear. I‚Äôm so confused and so sick of feeling like this and I honestly hate taking my inhalers because I don‚Äôt like taking medicine in general so this has been causing me a big deal of anxiety which just makes the shortness of breath worse!! Anyone else feel this way or ever get this way?

"I noticed a slight difference in my breathing, but I just started my first dose this afternoon around 4. I'm hoping this really helps. I will also be going to the lung dr at some point when that gets scheduled"
"For the past 8 months I have not been able to breathe through my nose. I've taken every allergy pill known to man &amp; I'm currently on singulair. I dont feel congested, it's just my nostrils are extremely inflamed. Its seems to make my asthma worse because I'm always mouth breathing. Anyone have experience 
with this?"
Does anyone feel as if they wheeze more when they are laying on one of their sides when they sleep. For the past few days when I‚Äôm laying in my left side I notice that I feel like I‚Äôm a bit more wheezy and feel shortness of breath. Does that even make sense? Anyways I‚Äôd love to know if anyone knows anything about this or what it could mean!
"Hi all,

I apologize for the length of this. I am just perplexed by what I‚Äôm dealing with and hoping someone here might have thoughts. 

I am a 27 year old F, moderately healthy other than being overweight. I don‚Äôt eat horribly and live a relatively active lifestyle. I have never in my life dealt with asthma or even allergies for that matter.

Three and a half weeks ago, I randomly started coughing. No other symptoms. No stuffy nose, no fever, no sore throat, no shortness of breath. Just coughing. It felt like a dry tickle in my throat. After a few days, I went to urgent care to be checked out. He said it was likely an upper respiratory infection and to see my PCP if it didn‚Äôt go away. Following those orders, I went to see my PCP‚Äôs Nurse Practitioner a week later. Her thought was that it was allergies, so she sent me home with Zyrtec, an albuterol inhaler, flonase, and some mucinex. The only thing this combination did for me was raise my heart rate and keep me up all night.

After this I started getting really anxious that something was really wrong. During this window (after I started with the inhaler) the cough changed. It was no longer a tickle causing me to cough, it was a spasm in my airway forcing me to cough. And almost no mucus is coming up, just small beads of white mucus sometimes. 

I have never had asthma, so I didn‚Äôt really register at first that that‚Äôs what it was, but I slowly started to realize that the inhaler was the ONLY thing helping that spasm feeling. 

I‚Äôm not wheezing, I‚Äôm not short of breath, my chest doesn‚Äôt hurt or feel tight. I just need the albuterol every 5 hours or else the spasm feeling starts again.

I think my doctor is perplexed too. She is referring me to a pulmonologist and wants me off albuterol because she thinks I‚Äôm too dependent on it. She‚Äôs giving me a short course of prednisone and a symbicort inhaler instead.

Has anyone else dealt with anything like this? Is this cough-variant asthma or just a reaction to coughing for so long? Am I going to be like this forever? I‚Äôm pretty miserable so I‚Äôd love to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts."
" when I lay flat its fine, but when I sit or move I have to dry cough. Its a loud barking dog like cough."
"Hello!

I‚Äôm a 26(f) with severe asthma. My doc says it‚Äôs eosinophilia but by IL allergen levels are super high too. My IGE is only at 300. And I know to qualify for Nucala it needs to be at least 150. 
I just took my second shot yesterday, does anyone have any experience with this medication? My asthma literally got worse out of nowhere last September and it‚Äôs been an terrible battle to get it under control since then. I take my albuterol nebulizer x3 a day and my inhaler 6-8. I‚Äôm also on the highest dose of Breo. And prednisone will only work for like two weeks before I feel like crap again. I don‚Äôt know what to do and it seems like my pulmonary doc is just like ‚Äútry the Nucala to see if it works‚Äù but I am tired of suffering and this is ruining my life and my relationships.

"Hello! I recently asked about doing an ‚Äúasthma clean‚Äù and I got lots of fabulous advice and it‚Äôs dawning on me that this is a lifestyle change (thanks guys!) I‚Äôm hoping asthma redditors will have similarly good advice about vacuums.

I had a dyson but the charge doesn‚Äôt hold so I need to see if I can get a battery for it so the charge can last longer.  However, if i need a hepa filter I‚Äôll have to get something new. The dyson is able to be dumped easily with a press of a button though, while my regular vacuum always has me taking it apart and pulling cat hair out where it gets stuck and washing the dust-coated foam.   It seems to defy the point if I just breathe everything in then! 

So just looking for advice or recs if you have a vacuum that is good for asthma.

I have e-asthma and I was given Nucala once I got out of the ICU. It worked like a charm and did the job until recently. I‚Äôve realized I have to pull up my lifestyle, be more minimalist, etc.

Thank you.

ETA: turns out I can upgrade the dyson to the next size up (and get a discount for doing so) and that one does have a hepa filter, so I think that‚Äôs my best option at this point. So I think I‚Äôve got my plan!  I‚Äôll donate my other vacuum to someone who doesn‚Äôt deal with this stuff.

My friend with eczema swears by the shark and I would‚Äôve considered that too."
"I notice that a lot of the commenters assume that everyone is using an HFA inhaler for their control med and should be using a spacer.  I use to use an HFA inhaler but more recently I was forced to switch to powder and when looking at most of the alternative meds out there, they mostly all have powder versions, and many do not have HFA versions any more or if they do the powder version may be cheaper.

So I guess my question is -- are HFA inhalers still the predominate thing people take for control meds or are most people moving to powder?  Secondly my understanding is that your shouldn't and can't use a spacer for powder inhalers?  Is that true or am I missing something?

Thanks."
"Since Symbicort contains a powder, is it safe to rely on that to know that there are still doses remaining? Seems obvious but just wanted to confirm"
"Hello asthma fam! This group is awesome and has been reassuring knowing I‚Äôm not alone in my asthma struggles. I‚Äôve been taking Advair (generic) Diskus 100/50 for a good 6 months now and notice an improvement. I‚Äôve also noticed a change in my voice. 

I‚Äôm also a singer and it‚Äôs annoying to hear the changes in my vocal chords. Ive been wondering if switching to the HFA inhaler would help reverse the effects. But mostly I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôll work as good as the Diskus?

Anyone have experience switching from the Diskus to HFA inhaler?"

As far as I know we haven't had COVID-19, but I found out my ex had it a long time ago and never told anyone so that visits wouldn't stop.  I just took the trash out in the rain (with an umbrella) and had an asthma attack, which surprised me.  Last week, my son and I lugged trash a farther distance and were tired, but fine.  I don't know why I had one this time.  Could rain be kicking triggers up into the air?"
"Anyone been on Trelegy and had BP and/ or heart related issues? 

I have been on for 2 months and I‚Äôm ready to get off it. It‚Äôs working well for my asthma but it‚Äôs making my BPhigh,  heart racing, jittery, headaches .  Anyone else experienced this?"
"Been a long time since I've used a push mower. I've been feeling great, almost jogging up and down stairs multiple times a day with no issues, haven't been using anything in a while, haven't felt like I needed it. I'm not in shape by any means, but I can do mile long walks fighting 3 dogs in humid 85¬∞ weather, no issue. Thought I'd be fine using the mower for 30 minutes. WRONG. Nearly sent me into an asthma attack. Damn thing didn't wanna go and pushing it along the side of a hill was hell. I felt out of breath, but not much more than normal. Until I stepped inside. Then the wheezing started and I lost my voice. Literally spent less than 15 minutes out there and this bullshit happened.

I've gained about 40-50lbs since my diagnosis nearly 5.5 years ago. I hate my life. I hate my body. I hate my lungs. Why can't I just have normal lungs again like I did in highschool üò≠"
It certainly isn't the coughing. It isn't the nebuliser. It isn't the shaking from the ventolin and the atrovent. It's when the nurses tell you to try and go to sleep even though you have a crap ton of energy and your heart rate is through the roof.
"Hey guys. I know everyone has a tough time with asthma, I‚Äôm just here to chime in and share my experience. 
I was born with it, it‚Äôs been a life long battle. I‚Äôm 23 years old and this has been the worst year by far for my asthma. 
I am so emotionally and physically frustrated, I‚Äôve tried everything. I have had so many hospital visits in the past few months and still no help!

For the past few months I‚Äôve been having sudden flare ups that go on for a days/weeks. Right now I‚Äôm taking 2 puffs Symbicort twice a day and ventolin as needed (which doesn‚Äôt even work for me anymore). I take vitamins, drink teas + this week I‚Äôm on on prednisone and I always use a humidifier, diffuser, etc. 

I‚Äôve had a realization that the healthcare system is honestly a scam. I‚Äôve been struggling with this all my life and not once has a doctor ever recommended for me to be more active, do breathing exercises or eat healthier. They only overdose me with medications to the point where I‚Äôm so heavily reliant on them now and can‚Äôt go a day without them. 
I‚Äôve talked to my doctors about this before and they just say that if I decide to let myself suffer by not taking my puffers I‚Äôll just risk scarring my lungs. I want wean off my puffers but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to risk damaging my lungs. 
I also wanted to know if people have had any success in improving their asthma by just working out and eating better? Also has anyone tried homeopathic medication? I feel like all these medications and their side effects have just worsened my condition and I just need some words of advice."
"Throughout my 20 years on this earth with asthma I have noticed that the different type of inhalers ( I look at them as light blue, dark blue, yellow, and red) have different type of medicine releasers. Since I was 15 I always had the original light blue inhaler but when I was about 16 I start getting yellow inhalers and it didn‚Äôt give me the medicine every time I pushed on it and my asthma drastically got worse. Now to present day, a few months ago I got the light blue inhaler back and I feel like the elephant on my chest is finally gone! I can breathe so much better. But after that lovely experience I sadly got a dark blue inhaler and it‚Äôs similar to the yellow inhaler but it gives you a normal dose of medicine and then the next hit it gives you half of that. 
I might just be a bit crazy lol but I have been thinking about this for years and now that I am high I‚Äôm like shit this needs to be on Reddit.

Update: when I mean light blue I mean the gray albuterol (sorry I‚Äôm a bit color unaware)"
"I was just wondering if havent been on my preventative inhaler all the time and have stopped a couple times cause ran out or thought was feeling better. I know during pandemic video meeting with doctor he said can stop if feel better but then asthma started to come back so got back on it. I haven‚Äôt really been in person with doctor or specialist to analyze my lungs in like 5 years because I‚Äôm very active, have acute asthma, and have gotten through most tough times by using home remedies but definitely have had bad smoke from Cali fires and dealing with other stuff where I gotta stay inside for summer and smoking weed too much but I have stopped and got that under control. 

Are these mini breaks and having to catch back up to get on my alvesco causing permanent damage? I think last doctor wasn‚Äôt very expert on the subject to tell me I can slow down and stop if I feel fine."
"25M here who has mostly grown out of my asthma besides using Alvesco preventative inhaler daily to help combat it coming back. My main trigger is mostly smoke. 

Literally haven‚Äôt smoked in like a month (weed) and never use cigs but last weekend was out at a concert and ripped my friends nic vape thing a couple times and ever since now I keep just randomly coughing. I don‚Äôt have a nasty cough like whooping but it‚Äôs more like a baby forced one due to chest tightness or something. It‚Äôs like day 3 and really annoying me. I feel fine otherwise and just doing my albuterol to help in the meantime until goes away but this has never happened and I‚Äôve hit vapes before so it‚Äôs weird. 

I workout a lot and am healthy and stuff I can take big breathes without wheezing so I‚Äôm really confused what‚Äôs happening"
What would dying from albuterol be like?
"Honestly just a rant about having asthma flare ups during covid times. Yes, I know I‚Äôm coughing. Yes, I know sick people cough. Yes, I KNOW it‚Äôs a really deep, gross cough. NO, it‚Äôs not covid. Yes, I‚Äôm okay. No, I‚Äôm not sick. I promise I want it to stop as much as you do, actually I promise I want it to stop *even more* than you do. Stop looking at me and mind your business.

i start coughing when I go from cold to hot. Then coughing make me even hotter which makes me cough more. Then I get embarrassed and try to stop coughing which only makes me cough louder. It‚Äôs a whole cycle of abuse that my lungs put me through. I feel like I need to start wearing a t-shirt that says ‚ÄúI have asthma, I‚Äôm not sick‚Äù whenever I go out in public."
I'm a 24 year old female with diagnosed exercise-induced asthma. Lately my symptoms have become progressively worse and having more issues with working out. I've had an active cough on and off for about a month (not Covid) along with chest pain/tightness when breathing during the day. I'm on advair + montelukast but it does not seem to be helping. I've been prescribed prednisone (3 days at a time) during bad flare-ups and it seems to be the only medication helping my symptoms at the moment. Any advice on additional long-term treatment I could consider with my Dr?
Is there a way I can train my body to be able to exercise without the inhaler before?
"Hey I'm a 3d modeler and also an asthmatic and I have my own custom inhaler that I made with a 3d printer. But I was wondering whether you guys would buy something like this off of an online store? Thanks for considering, have a great day!"
"Just recently got diagnosed with asthma. At first he said COPD because of my spirometer test and then he did a cat scan and said it was actually just asthma. Well he didn‚Äôt give me an emergency inhaler only airduo I think it‚Äôs called? Or advair? I have to do it for 3 months. Anyways, my chest has been feeling so tight on and off. Not really coughing or anything . Just tightness! Anyone have suggestions on what to do to ease that up?? I don‚Äôt want to go to the hospital or anything. Im not struggling to breathe, but don‚Äôt know how to ease up the symptoms. Any feedback is appreciated! Thanks!!"
"I've  been smoking cigarettes for the past 5 years so my asthma isn't great but stable-ish, I switch to vaping in particular a geekbar but I'm taking my inhaler every two minutes.
Does anyone have experience with deteriorating asthma after starting to vape?"
"Looking for advice on asthma symptoms - trying to figure out if I have some sort of cold weather / exercise asthma.

Conundrum is that I've had a few episodes of sore chest in recent years, like an inflamed feeling you might get if you went for a run on cold day. But it's never accompanied by any feeling of constriction, no coughing or wheezing. It's brought on by hard exercise or cold weather, and it's not associated with anything else like an obvious cold or a chest infection (although it does lay me a bit low and not up to training) - does this sound like it's in the realm of asthma?

I guess asthma is a bit of an umbrella term, but isn't the common feature airflow related? Like I have friends who say an asthma attack is like breathing through a straw. This is nothing like that and much more achey chest. I've seen a asthma nurse who suggested giving the brown preventer inhaler a go for a while (the blue salbutamol one does nothing for me) - not done it yet and thought I'd ask on here if other people have experienced similar symptoms."
"My face is suddenly vivid red and my cheeks feel warm. Is it a known side effect? 

I have no fever and I‚Äôm on a short-term course for an asthma flare-up. Just want to make sure it‚Äôs not a sign of something serious."
I recently went to an allergist/ asthma specialist and my pulmonary function test was really bad in short. I got put on symbicort and went to pick it up from the pharmacy but it was $450 and as a college student I cannot afford that. I struggle everyday trying to breathe I have really bad asthma and my allergies make it worse. Is there anyway I could get symbicort cheaper? Or an alternative?
"Hi, as the title says I am looking for a non steroid asthma medication or inhaler.   My anthem is moderate not severe thankfully. I have bipolar, and the steroids aren‚Äôt good for my mania.  I‚Äôm prescibed albuterol and alvesoc which work, but I don‚Äôt take them due to side effects. 

Seeing my doctor in a week and I‚Äôm looking for alternatives. 

Thank you."
"Hey Guys,

New to this subreddit, I wanted to know if Flovent works for you?  
Do I need to take it every day?

I try to use Flovent (orange) but it doesn't do much on the other hand Ventolin (blue) works and works really well!

When I take pre-workout and run, I cut 30 mins off my 4 mile run from 1.5 to 1 hour.

If I take Ventolin 2x per week, do I still need to take Flovent? I don't like the side effects I read so trying to minimize this as much as possible, asking here as doc advice esp when it comes to pharma is a bit bias IMO."

"I was recently diagnosed with asthma, about a month ago. The pulmonologist prescribed the Foster inhaler, twice a day and whenever needed. But since I started using it, I have experienced sleeplessness for most of the nights. I just couldn't fall asleep. I would just lie in bed, feel relaxed, maybe drift off a little bit, but suddenly I'd be wide awake again. There was even one night where I fell asleep around 4.45am... 

Last weekend I did not use the inhaler at all or only one or two doses in the morning, and I'd fall asleep within 15 minutes. It's such a big difference! The side effects in the prescription do mention sleeplessness as a very rare side effect and my GP said there hasn't been enough research to really confirm it. But to me it's pretty clear it's linked to the Foster inhaler.

I was wondering whether other people have experienced something similar? What did you do? Did it help to switch brands / another kind of asthma medication? I'd love to hear from you."
"Back story: I‚Äôve been suffering from an asthma flare-up this last year and it‚Äôs been a very painful, long process to try to control it. I currently take Advair 230/21 as a preventative inhaler (max! 4 puffs a day since Feb 2021), 2 Zyrtecs a day, and started Dupixent in august 2021. I‚Äôve felt like my asthma is at a point where with minimal exertion and talking, I‚Äôm fine. But I still can‚Äôt talk more than a few sentences without getting short of breath and stopping to take a breath. I‚Äôm really starting to reach my threshold with this issue. I‚Äôve been thinking it could have something to do with my nasal congestion. I have very swollen nasal passages that are stuffy most of the time, but I‚Äôm still able to breathe from them when I‚Äôm not talking I guess. I‚Äôve tried different nasal sprays for this (Flonase, azelastine) but they give me headaches/ear aches/fatigue. Not sure if that could be the root cause or not. If you‚Äôve experienced something similar, I‚Äôd appreciate some advice going forward."


So I haven‚Äôt had it in about 3 days as I‚Äôve been waiting for my doc to renew my prescription and shortness of breath has decided to pop up. Has anyone else experienced this?
"Amyone have increased cavities from inhaler use? Im new to asthma, just got diagnosed friday. I have several cracked teeth in my mouth following a failed jaw surgery that caused a wierd uneven bite. So im scared that this flovent hfa 220mcg i was given will give me more cavities and dental issues. Im scared to death to use this inhaler and have more health issues"
"Hello,

I am a 26 year old male with allergic asthma. I had a flare up from April and did not have any insurance as I switched jobs. I was mainly using ginger to antihistamines to deal with the flare up. I ultimately had shortness of breath, chest tightness, runny nose, chest cold over the next few months.

In July, my health insurance kicked in and I saw my allergist. I was prescribed Advair HFA 115/21 and generic Pro Air. Overally, the chest tightness, runny nose, and chest cold went away. I can breathe better but still have constant shortness of breath and needing to use the rescue inhaler regularly. 

I was looking at the list of medication my insurance covers and I seen that it covers Symbicort 160/4.5 (i used to use this before my first job's health insurance as it did not cover it. I remembered that it did work when i used it).

I am going to see my allergist in mid-October to ask whether if I should use Symbicort instead and get the generic Ventolin (my insurance does not cover any of the brand rescue inhalers and I had better experiences with ventolin). In the meantime, I wanted some advice regarding whether if anyone had experience using both and which they prefer or if there was any inhalers or other asthma medication that worked for you. 

I trying to get back to the days when I did not use my rescue inhaler for months! So any advice would be appreciated."
"Hey folks,

When I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 5 and grew out of it in my mid or late teens. But during those 'asthma years', it was pretty rough for me especially in the winter and spring season. I was hospitalized, often stayed home from school and my inhaler and nebulizer became another limb for me during that time.

Fortunately, I have not had a trigger or any respiratory issues since - but I do wonder if your asthma can come back later in life?

I know that my mom also had a rough time with asthma when she was young and was cured from it when she became an adult but she does still have moments of triggers and she usually has her inhaler on hand, also like me, during the winter and spring season.

But does here know if asthma can come back later in life or does it really depend on the person?"
"Had asthma all of my life, went a few years without ever needing an inhaler but now recently it's been flaring up worse than ever before, needing to use an inhaler every morning to breathe. I have 3 animals that shed quite bad, and I've heard an air purifier should help! Any suggestions on  working ones that aren't extremely expensive? Would ideally buy one for the bedroom and one for the living room"
Hello warriors... Came to tell you that I'm getting better just because of this one spice called Black Cumin. You guys should try it as well. All the best.
"RSV did a *number* on my lungs. It was *finally* under control with a 2 times daily steroid inhaler and a biologic shot, then I caught RSV from my nephews. While my lungs are better than when I actively had the RSV and the few weeks after, they haven't recovered enough for me to get back to working out. I'm not needing my rescue every few hours, but my lungs *hurt* and exercising (even a slightly brisk walk) will cause an attack. I know it's better now because I can walk to and from the bathroom without getting winded, and my oxygen has stopped dropping to the low 90's high 80's, but I'm just so *frustrated.* How long should I expect it to take to fully recover from this? What can *I* do without having to go to the hospital that my pulm works at to help myself? (I'm fully vaccinated but trying to avoid stepping foot in the hospital because covid cases are rampant there.)"
"I have eosinophilic asthma, and get Nucala injections every month for the past year and a bit. My asthma has been flaring up pretty bad for the last month, I did a round of prednisone but I feel like I have only gotten worse since then. There has been a few time lately (especially at night) that my inhaler has not been helping and I have been getting genuinely scared. I feel helpless right now, I‚Äôve been doing nebulizer treatments everyday and they help for about 30 mins, then I am back to being tight chested and wheezing. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that I have been feeling very down mentally. Really unsure of what to do, I‚Äôve been scared to go to sleep"
"Hi all, 

I was recently duagnosed with asmtha at the mayo clinic. I did not do well with the albuterol bc of my tachycardia (high heart rate) being elevated by it, so they put me on a Flutocortisone inhaler.

Im pretty worried about it using it. I have alot of health issues at 28yr old, and a long family history of health issues such as diabetes, glaucoma, htn, ect. that im afraif this medication will make me develope. I also have a lot of dental issues, and several jaw surgeries for mandibular advancement that have left me with poor teeth, gums, and lots of plates and screws. I just recently got a 1700 root canal in a 1500 crown plus the 637 filling to fill it back up after. And i just broke a tooth over the weekend. Its pretty crazy.

I saw this medication can cause diabetes, glaucoma, weak bones, and teeth/mouth fungus. Plus i wasnt told this, but apperently i need to carry something that says i  take flutocortisone inhalers?? 

How dangerous is this medication, and does anyone here work in healthcare and can tell me if it affects your patient care?"
I recently got diagnosed after suffering from asthma for so long. I take abuterol or whatever it‚Äôs called before I exercise and it‚Äôs making me too shaky. I can‚Äôt focus anymore during karate and it‚Äôs really disturbing me. Any tips how to stop the tremors and the weak feeling? Just FYI I take symbicort twice a day if that might change anything. Symbicort makes me a bit shaky but it goes away quick. The abuterol is making me shaky still even tho it‚Äôs been two hours. It may just be because I‚Äôm not used to these meds.
"I learned something recently that I thought some of you other athma folks might be interested in. So I have allergic asthma for sure. However, I would also get these symptoms that I thought were part of the asthma that made me feel that my throat was closing or that there was a lump in my throat along with wheezing. It would feel difficult to breath in, as opposed to with asthma where it is difficult to breath out. It would happen at seemingly random times, or with exercise or stress/anxiety. After visits to the doctor during these episodes they would find that my lung function was perfectly healthy. I was referred to an ENT to look at my vocal cords, and then to a speech therapist. As it turns out, I have vocal cord dysfunction also called paradoxical vocal-fold motion. Essentially my vocal cords close when they aren't meant to. I learned that the symptoms mimic asthma very closely and is very often misdiagnosed. So what I had thought to be only asthma all along was actually this condition! And what's more is that it is very common to have both actual asthma and this condition, and that this condition is most common in young women who also have anxiety. So all this to say, if you have similar symptoms it might be worth checking out! I had never heard of this before and it's unfortunately not well enough understood and so often misdiagnosed. I hope this is interesting to some of you! I find it fascinating, and I'm really glad to know what is really going on so I can treat it better"
Most asthmatics are on inhalers. What else has helped you along the way? And in what aspect or for what symptom has it helped you?
"This is a weird question I‚Äôm sure, but does anyone notice when they‚Äôre having an asthma flair up that it effects the stomach too?

"Basically the title. I‚Äôve been put on an 8 day tapered dose of prednisone (2 days 40 mg, 2 days 30 mg, etc.) for a bad, asthma-related coughing flare that‚Äôs been going on just over a month now. I‚Äôm a bit concerned because I‚Äôm towards the end of day 2 and still coughing quite a lot, when usually I feel relief pretty quickly if I recall correctly. So what is your average # days before you usually start seeing an improvement?"
"I‚Äôm not in a good place. I‚Äôve got severe asthma and multiple therapies at maximum dose. This week, my PEFs have been dropping and my asthma worsening. Then three days or thunderstorms a month early for us here in Australia. 

With our community in a lockdown and our hospitals starting to feel the brunt of covid cases, I‚Äôm worried about my risk if I end up in hospital as I‚Äôm immunocompromised, have very crap lungs at the best of times and now they‚Äôre super bad despite steroids.

I‚Äôm watching my PEFs and hoping I do t hit the the magic number that makes me go to hospital. I‚Äôm a bit hypoxic and find it okay to type but when it comes to having a conversation I get out of breath and start flaring and then my brain slows (as expected) and it takes me a bit to say what I wanted to say. My ribs are killing me as are my back, neck and pretty much everything. Severely lethargic and exhausted. I‚Äôll push through. 

My doc and specialist have me in home iso most of this year. Really sucks. No visitors, no outside world. I‚Äôm lucky for the company of my Dogs üê∂ and network of friends who chat online / on phone with. 

Sorry if this is a bit of a downer. I‚Äôm just a bit over it all and over of not having a life outside my house.

There‚Äôs not a lot of info or experiences of people online dealing with severe asthma and living the covid normal. What‚Äôs your experience? Have you been able to return to some normality?

"Hey all! I am not sure if this is an asthma thing or a digestive thing, but whenever I eat, during or right after, I have a horrible time getting full breaths and visibly struggle to take a good, full breath.

Its definitely gotten worse now since I've had my gallbladder removal, and I had been keeping track of what food causes it, but it's with EVERY food now. I even went until 2PM without eating yesterday, and it started around noon-1PM without food. I've noticed after I eat, changing into super loose pants, or unbuttoning my jeans helps a little. 

My GI doctor said to wean off of my pantoprozole after my gallbladder surgery, so I am not on any acid reducers so I wasn't sure if that was the issue, or my asthma worsening. I have been diagnosed with seasonal asthma, but it only would trigger around March/April, not September/October. 

I do have a GI appointment in 2 weeks, so I can bring it up then. When I saw my PCP, he said oh you have anxiety, it's anxiety üôÑ and that's just super not fucking helpful. I have the anxiety BECAUSE I can't breathe... Also wondering if it was some sort of allergy, but I don't think I'd be allergic to something that is literally everywhere? This breathing issue happens everywhere. 

I'm not sure what it would be. A close friend of mine even noticed lately that I gasp for air a lot, and have to lay down flat on my back. Any thoughts?"
My husband switched from cigarettes to vaping and now does it indoors because he claims it's just vapor. But im like 95% sure that the smells and whatever the vapor is makes me couch.

"hi all,

i just adopted a 2-3 year old chihuahua who came from a hoarding situation (99 chihuahuas in one home!) because of this, she has never been bathed. and, therefore, is terrified of water.

i'm not usually very allergic to dogs, but i am asthmatic and allergic to other things. and as i get older, my breathing troubles / allergies increase.

i'm writing because i am noticing i am allergic to her. i get mild - moderate asthma symptoms and occasionally a stuffed nose when we spend prolonged periods of time with each other.

i bought aller tech shampoo, allerpet dander removed, a brush, and a HEPA air filter. they are all coming in the mail so i have yet to use them. that, along with vacuuming should help. but, it's gonna take a little time of trust building before i can clean her. this could take few more weeks, even.

but, i am concerned, and the internet hasn't been able to answer this for me, so i want to ask here: has anyone else ever gotten a dog that has never been bathed? did that contribute to your allergies / asthma? after you bathed her, did she become less allergen producing?

she is a snuggler, and i don't want to miss out on the opportunity to cuddle! so any hope or similar stories would be very much appreciated.

thanks!"

"Dear reddit,

I might need your help.

I'm currently in a asthma exarcebation and don't know what to do anymore. Im feeling very bad very tired. Sometimes I lts exertion to get of the couch or bed. My workplace is also not happy that I'm home right now. I'm know to have these attacks from time to time. My physician made me a treatment plan that I can up the dosis of some medication and take extra to calm the attack down.¬†


Right now I'm 4 weeks in this attack and I'm so freaking tired.¬†


My diagnosis is¬† non eosinoflic allergic asthma with lowered histamine threshold (wat the doc told me) .¬†¬†


The shortness of breath is not to bad right now when I'm just sitting, when I'm moving I'm not really gasping for breath but I need to pause mid sentence when talking. And stop sometimes with walking otherwise I become a bit dizzy. I'm just coughing so so much.(a couple days ago I even coughed pink mucous, the rest of the time white/clear with bubbles) My whole body is hurting.¬† The last 2 weeks I'm¬† having 38¬† to 38, 5 c sometimes I'm having normal temperature.¬† The docter measured my inflammation marker with fingerprick and they were normal.¬† I have a saturation meter for my finger at home. Most of the time it's 96% my heart rate is elevated 100-110. Covid test was negative. I am vaccinated with Pfizer.¬†


My current medication is

Up to 4x 2puff foster

Up to 4x 2puff berodual¬†

2x2 puff alvesco

Up to 4x¬† a day codeine 20mg to stop the coughing

omeprazol

Antihistamine tablet

I also have nebulizer which I can use when needed.¬†


I'm the last couple of weeks I have had 2 40mg prednisolon courses of 5 days each¬†


Right now I'm dat 6 of a 7 day course of antibiotics.¬† Nothing is getting better.¬†


Last year I already went to specialized asthma center which evaluated my medicine ect. There was nothing they could do.¬†


I also had trouble with ibs for years and years. Could there be a relationship?¬† Or do you know something my doc is missing?"

I was diagnosed when I was around 2 years old and for most of my child life up until like 9th grade I had bad asthma and needed my Inhaler and possibly nebulizer.

I use albuterol for exercise induced asthma before my rugby matches in which I am running practically nonstop. I use it before working out as I should but also puff it sometimes in the middle of matches when my water is run out to me. I can‚Äôt tell if it actually does anything the second puff around while I‚Äôm already exercising. I‚Äôll sometimes start to wheeze heavily so I preemptively take that second puff. Anyone relate/ do the same or know if it makes a difference ?
"So I‚Äôm a 39 year old female and since fracturing my rib a few weeks ago my heart rate has been on the steady increase. 

Here‚Äôs a little background‚Ä¶‚Ä¶usually my resting HR is around 51-53. 

I fell 3 weeks ago, where I fractured a rib, had a lung infection and the tissue and muscle around the fractured rib is ruptured. The GP has instructed that i rest and do try but I don‚Äôt do rest very easily. 

However since stopping my antibiotics and steroids (infection has cleared) my heart rate is so high these days as I struggle with my rib and tissue/muscle damage. 

My HR is now sitting around 100-120 and I don‚Äôt know how to bring it down. I‚Äôve tried resting, relaxing and meditating but it‚Äôs not helping. 

any advice greatly appreciated."
"Hello all, I've posted here a few weeks ago. I've recently discovered I had asthma - I didn't know I had it until I felt some issues breathing in even while resting lately. I'm a 36 male and I've been working out for 15 years and I'm biking alot.   


I've always thought my cardio limitations were natural. In the past 2 years, whenever I was working out, I'd go with lighter weights, especially for demanding exercises (squats an deadlifts - very taxing on my cardio). I just thought ''oh, I'm aging and I don't need to pull all that weight anyways''. Everytime I'd squat juste 1 plate each side it felt like my heart was gonna rip out of my chest.   


And that, my friends, changed with the pump I'm taking morning and night to control my asthma. I guess that my heart had to pump 3 times more for the lack of oxygen that was absorbed by my lungs. Is that how it works ? I'm just blown away on how much difference I see when I do physical efforts now compared to how it was in the past years. Am I the only one like that ? I'm also shocked to see how pernicious asthma can be, as in you can't really know you have it sometimes if you don't have asthma attacks. 

It made me realize that asthma is an issue not well knows by the general public, and I feel like if I didn't think I had asthma at all, maybe alot of people are not aware that they have it as well. Anyway, I'm so happy that science is there to save my butt and make me feel strong again."
Hey all so I‚Äôve had mild intermittent asthma for like 7 or 8 years and when I asked my doctor for a refill of albuterol she had me come in and decided to add montelukast as well. I took one pill last night and felt phlegmy all day (which I assumed was everything starting to release and drain since it helps with allergies too) but now my whole body‚Äôs achey as well. Did anybody else experience side effects like this when they started taking it and did it go away?
"I am still kinda new to asthma (diagnoized a bit over a year ago and developing rather quickly unfortunately) and was wondering if anybody else experiences this:

Having a heavy but not uncomfortable weight on my chest often causes small coughing fits (my boyfriend and I like cuddling by kinda lying on top of each other, idk if its weird but its really nice, like a weighted human planket). It feels like the kind of coughing I have during asthma flare ups and sometimes there is also some chest pain afterwards. I don't really have breathing problems or shortness of breath when this happens. 

Its kinda weird though, I don't really have any other symptoms at the moment. I inhale novopulmon twice a day as prescribed by my doctor and my peak flow is stabily at its best and I barely have any shortness of breath or wheezing when I do exercise (my asthma is mostly exercised triggered, I had really bad symptoms until a couple of weeks ago so my doctor doubled my daily cortison dosis). So I guess I am wondering if this is even asthma related? 

I am avoiding to trigger the coughing for now till I can talk to my doctor again but I was just wondering if this is common at all? This is really hard to google cause ""weight on chest"" is usually more of an asthma symptom then trigger I guess?! 

 Thanks for any insights."
"I may have adult onset asthma so I was given medication to test it out. I have a long lasting dry cough and shortness of breath for about 8 weeks. I was given Breo Ellipta and an emergency inhaler (albuterol). After two weeks of Breo Ellipta, my cough subsided. However, whenever I use my emergency inhaler‚Ä¶.it does nothing for me. It has no effect. Is this uncommon for asthma?"
"I‚Äôve been sick for quite awhile with asthma. Even recovering, I was exhausted and reconditioned.  I‚Äôve been managing the basics of food, laundry, dishes, light cleaning, etc.  

I should add that I have eosinophilic asthma. 

I am sure that a good deep clean would make a difference to my asthma, and my family Is going to help. It may take a week or  so.

I know HOW clean my condo and what to do, but does anyway have specific advice for cleaning for asthma? 

Also-suggestions for cleaning products asthmatics should I use?  I don‚Äôt want to get an attack from the products either (it‚Äôs never happened, though. 

Thank you so much for any thoughts."
"I was on symbicort for about 3.5 years but it recently stopped working, landing me in the ER a week ago and leading to constant coughing while going about my life. Today I discontinued symbicort and switched to Breo at the advice of my dr and haven't had my usual coughing fits which is great! But when does the chest tightness go away? When does my breathing feel closer to controlled? When will I get used to taking the inhaler only once daily instead of twice? How long should I give this medication to really get into my system before I make the call about whether it works or not?"
"Now, don't quote me guys, but after a long battle with asthma, I am day 8 into Advair HFA 230 mcg, and I haven't had to use a rescue inhaler for like 4 days, and now I notice my mucus in my chest has SIGNIFICANTLY went down too. Breathing is super easy now. I won. I think my body really loves fluticasone propionate.

Now, I just need to win my battle against money. It's great I found that Advair HFA seems to be working, but it sucks balls its so expensive in the USA if insurance doesn't cover it. I'm looking into using the ""ordering from a canadian pharmacy"" route in the future. Anyone have any experience with that?"
"Hi all!

I hope you're all are well. I have allergic asthma and several allergies (e.g. pets, dust, hayfever). I began immunotherapy about six months ago and am waiting to see some drastic changes in my allergies. I haven't seen much improvement yet. 

Additionally, my partner would love us to move in together but I'm concerned as he has a dachshund. While we bought an air purifier for his apartment and is diligent about cleaning, I still find myself wheezing and needing to use my rescue inhaler sometimes when I'm there. Also, I ended up in the ER around the holidays after trying to stay with his family with a golden retriever along with his dog. 

I'm completely fine with dealing the itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing but I don't want to worry about breathing. As of now, my prescription allergy medication and treatment plan are keeping my asthma and allergies in check. After my attack, they both received a much needed overhaul from my pulmonologist. Anyway, I would love to read about people's experiences with immunotherapy and how it affected their allergic asthma or maybe some tips to help live with a dog in the future. Thank you!!"
"So I‚Äôm 17 and I have severe asthma, I‚Äôve had it all my life but my mum is usually the one who tells me when to go to A&amp;E. 

For the past day and a bit, I‚Äôve been struggling with it for the first time in a year and a half. I hardly slept last night because I was wheezing and then I would have my inhaler than my heartbeat makes it heard for me to sleep. I can‚Äôt laugh because I‚Äôll throw myself into a coughing fit. The pain in my chest has stopped now but it would probably start up again. In the past 24 hours I would say I‚Äôve had at least 70+ puffs of my inhaler. 

So what I‚Äôm asking, when exactly should I go to the hospital?"
"I'm 30M and have had allergic asthma my whole life. I got onto inhalers when I was 24. I come from a place where inhalers are looked down upon and more emphasis is given to natural, homeopathic or any holistic way of healing which is why it took so much time for me to get on inhalers. I had no idea how better my quality of life would be on it as all the other methods had little to no effect and I had accepted that it would be like that my whole life. Enough of my rant, back to the main question. Does asthma or allergies get worse with age? Will there be any impact on my respiratory as I age? Are inhalers safe to take on a long run? Are there any steps that I can take to not make it worse?

I am on maintenance inhalers and my asthma is well managed at present. No issues with my lungs though my PFT does always show that I don't have the ideal lung function. I can of course ask a medical professional but I wanted some anecdotal experiences that people may have had in this sub."
Has anyone used them before? Can you share your experience?
"Ok. So I don't seriously think I'm going to die, but the internet tells me these two medications should *not* be taken together and I accidentally messed up.

Has anyone taken these together? Please reassure me. My health OCD has been through the roof since my recent asthma diagnosis.

I'm suddenly very anxious I'm going to get side effects."
"i have asthma, have an abuteral inhaler, but the main trigger to mine is laughing spells üòÇüòÇüòÇ is it like this for anyone else? it makes me hold back my happiness or hanging out with friends because i know i‚Äôll have an attack"
"My kid gave me some virus and every time I get sick I need an inhaler due to childhood asthma. My heart rate was already increased today from being sick but I just picked up my inhaler to help with my shortness of breathe and now my resting heart rate is like 95 - normally resting is 54-60 for me. I‚Äôm jittery and can‚Äôt sleep (and I need to so badly). 

Is this common? Do I need to go to the doc again and get a new inhaler? üò≥"
" Do you guys order from canada or something? I wanna know how you guys afford the meds, when you don't have health insurance."
"This medicine was god send for someone like me who has a lot of allergies, not just to environmental allergens but also to a lot of food (dairy, gluten, bananas, cobalt etc). 


My ashtma is very bad, it does not really causes any extreme shortness of breath, it's just persistent and no matter what it won't go away..!


I am taking inhaler upon inhalers everyday, and no matter what that little shortness of breath / inflammation sort of feeling specially in the lower part of Airways just won't go away. I have to breath in hard to feel the swelling. 

How do I know that it is ashtma? Well because sometimes it gets 100% better on its own. This is how I know I have ashtma and not something else ( doctor also diagnosed asthma).

It's been 6 months and I just can't breathe properly, it is worse in day time after eating something ( I suspected food allergies and stopped eating gluten + dairy), I am trying elimination diet to see exactly was causing my asthma but I am sure food allergies are a big part of it. 

I get short of breath after eating food specially, and the flare ups lasts for about 7-8 hours..! It's no joke, my lungs feel inflamed all the time.


After a lot of money spent and doctor's giving up, I had to figure it out on my own.

Montelukast works 60%, I still get shortness of breath sometimes so I keep taking inhaler daily which contains Flucticasone + formetorol. This combination alone doesn't works either, ( 3 months and it still hasn't helped that much )


Sabalbuteral does not works for me., I am guessing the medicine is just not going deep inside the lungs ( I tried all sorts of inhalers like DPI, MDI, spacers etc).

Since it gets worse after eating, I am trying elimination diet and already seeing a lot of improvements.

I am also fixing nutrition ( d3, cortisol, omega 3 etc). 

Montelukast is amazing because it also completely cures some symptoms of my food, ashtma and environmental allergies. 

Biggest problem with montelukast is it's side effects, it's definitely brutal asf, and they rarely go away for me.

What's wrong? 

After I take it, 30 minutes down  and it makes me extremely lethargic, drowsy, I feel like my eyes and brain are getting warm and heavy, feels sedating.

It also bloats my face ( tested and confirmed), I think it happens because it retains fluids. It's also hard to lose weight on it, once I stopped taking it, my face bloat went away.


I still have energy if I combine it with ritalin, but I can't feel the speed which ritalin used to give me, I just feel a little bit more energetic.


Should I take it before bed ( because of half life, it's short so I am guessing if half of it goes out of my system, it will also reduce the side effects?)


It works like charm, but side effects are just way too out of control, my head feels heavy like taking bath in hot tub before bed time. 

Any advices? My ashtma Is very bad it literally ruined 6 months of my life..! 

TIA"

"I went for a review today I'm 15 and I got told my montelukast has to be upped even tho I said my asthma was great 

1 why do people have to go up to 10mg at a certain age

2 I have no side effects on 5mg so I'm scared to go on to 10mg incase my suicidal thoughts and anxiety get worse as I'm already going through prozac withdrawl she said to just stop if I wanted to but let her know so I will but what signs are there in case"
"My GP doesn‚Äôt want to send me to a CT scan ‚Äúbecause too young to have COPD‚Äù

I‚Äôm 30M, my spirometry test has shown a mild obstruction (the ratio is 0,65; FEV1 is 92%). Irreversible. 

Shortness of breath at rest (sometimes), no shortness of breath when exercising/physical activity.

No allergies.

He put me on steroids for a month (long lasting inhaler) but it didn‚Äôt change the results. X Ray is clear.

I‚Äôve suggested my concerns about COPD but he dismissed it saying ‚Äúyour symptoms don‚Äôt fit; you are too young, your x Ray is clear.‚Äù Therefore he‚Äôs ‚Äúabsolutely sure‚Äù there‚Äôs no need for a CT scan.

What should I do? What can it be?"
"Its crazy how many doctors are completely unaware of the link between GERD/Silent reflux and breathing. I have just gone through this and it felt like I was in hell so I want to share this to help others like me. 

**False dyspnea**. When acid gets into your esophagus it constricts your lungs even if it doesnt hurt. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89GoKfRRuA&amp;list=LL&amp;index=4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89GoKfRRuA&amp;list=LL&amp;index=4)

**Pepsin**. Pepsin gas comes up to your throat when your sphincters are weak. It lodges into the flesh in your ears, sinuses, throat and even lungs. the only way to inactivate it is with high ph water. Gargling/drinking with alkaline water several times a day will very quickly improve symptoms of throat pain. You can also carefully spray it in your nose while inhaling as well as in your mouth. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22844861/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22844861/)

This facebook group has tons of info for almost everything you need to know about this condition [https://www.facebook.com/refluxhelp/?ref=page\_internal](https://www.facebook.com/refluxhelp/?ref=page_internal)

**Hiatal Hernia**. This may be one of the main things that is causing all your problems. 

My symptoms started 3 weeks ago and I started my diet and treatment plan 2 weeks ago which includes ppis for acid suppresion(as i had esophigitis) as well as the lifestyle/diet changes talked about in the facebook group. I have very slowly gotten better and my breathing has improved massively compared to 2 weeks ago.

All symptoms are different for everyone but in my case, I had constant shortness of breath, very hard time breathing in, burning pain in my chest, elevated heart rate, no appetite, chills, anxiety, throat pain, inflamed sinuses, and just generally feeling shitty. Some people may only have throat pain or even just shortness of breath with no other discernible symptoms."
"If you suffer from asthma like I do, you probably think that you can‚Äôt exercise properly or safely. Contrary to what many think of this subject, there are ways that you can get in shape and exercise, even if you suffer from asthma.

[Asthma is a chronic lung disease that is marked by characteristics such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Asthma tends to occur with people who are genetically or environmentally predisposed to the condition.](https://preview.redd.it/xpo0hhd1wfq71.jpg?width=301&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63f00aebb9d206fac15f4c6be713c0589d8920bd)

Some of the triggers that may start or make an attack worse include exposure to allergens, viral respiratory infections, airway irritants, exercise, and exposure to things such as dust mites or cockroaches. You can prevent asthma attacks by simply doing the following:

1. Bathe your pets weekly.
2. Don‚Äôt smoke or permit smoking in your home.
3. When mold or pollen counts are high, you should stay inside with air conditioning.
4. Wash your bedding and any stuffed toys at least once per week in hot water.
5. Wash your hands every chance you get.
6. Get a flu shot.
7. Wear a scarf over your mouth and nose in the winter months.
8. Be proactive and know your triggers and how you should avoid them.

Now that you know what you know about asthma, you may be wondering where exercise fits in. As most doctors will tell you, you shouldn‚Äôt give up on sports or exercise at all. You just have to be smart about how you play and take special precautions to avoid attacks.

Almost all doctors agree that the best way to prevent attacks during exercise is to keep your inhaler and medication close by. You should never use the inhaler more than 3 times during a game or exercise session. If you are up the previous night with coughing and wheezing, it‚Äôs always best to go light with your exercise the next day.

For something known as IEA (Exercise Induced Asthma), the symptoms are somewhat different, in the fact that they appear after 6 ‚Äì 10 minutes of exercise and will often be worse in cold or dry air. If you have IEA, there are several activities that you can enjoy such as swimming, walking, biking, downhill skiing, and team based sports. There are many activities for you to choose from, to ensure you get the exercise you need as well.

Keep in mind that the condition of asthma isn‚Äôt ‚Äúall in your head‚Äù, it is a real physiological medical treatment that will require treatment to prevent and treat. Even though your doctor will be your best friend in treating asthma, you are the one who can prevent your symptoms.

Always be smart, take your medication, and be proactive. Don‚Äôt let it put you in a life of misery ‚Äì as you can enjoy exercise just like everyone else."

"I‚Äôve had this my whole life and I‚Äôm. It sure if it‚Äôs asthma or what it is but when I do high intensity excercise like sprints or grappling or something, I start breathing very hard almost wheezing. My teammates always ask me if I‚Äôm alright. 

I don‚Äôt have this problem when I am just doing moderate excercise though. Any thoughts on what this might be and what I can do to treat it? Especially now in wrestling, it‚Äôs really hindering me is I have to keep taking breaks."
"(13F) So I have had exercise induced asthma my entire life, but I forget I have it because it has never affected my life at all. But today I was just sitting (not doing exercise) and my chest felt, light? Airy? My breathing felt airy (like, hard to catch a breath airy) and this has happened before, but it just happens once then not again so I just ignored it, thought it happened to everyone. But today it happened like around 5 times in a row at least, and since I was at school I went to the nurse because it freaked me out and so I decided using my inhaler might help it not happen again. It is now night and it has happened a few times while laying here but not bad, and I have GA (Generalized Anxiety) and I am freaking out, scared it will happen again but not stop, and I won‚Äôt be able to breath. Is this a normal asthma symptom? (The breathing part, not the anxiety)
Also, forgot to add this, but afterwords my chest hurt a tiny bit and it has the rest of the day now."

"I was at the hospital yesterday for a completely different issue. actuslly low blood pressure from my medication, but the dr said is possible I may have asthma. he ordered me a albuterol inhaler 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed. I have an appointment with the drs assistant on friday and will be asking about an asthma test. a little information I been dealing with breathing issues for years, tight chest, occasional wheezing, shortness of breath, sleeping issues, headaches in the morning, and some more symptoms. I don't doubt that I don't have anxiety issues, but now that I think back a lot of my episodes were at night or morning. while calming down helped me I have felt the heavy chest issue for the last 4 maybe 5 years. is there any specific tests I should ask the pcp pa?"
"I was recently put back on simbicort after having been using my rescue inhaler an insane amount. 
I‚Äôm 3 weeks into using simbicort and the first 2 weeks I felt great. I suddenly could breathe again, but now my shortness of breath has come back and I‚Äôm back to using my rescue inhaler 4-10 times a day just to catch my breath. 

My dr joked about me having had covid just cus of how inflamed my lungs sounded, but I‚Äôve never been sick since this whole pandemic started. I‚Äôm losing my mind though from this shortness of breath. I‚Äôve had it as a teen and now I‚Äôm in my 30s and it‚Äôs way worse. Its affecting my job, my ability to just play guitar and even function. Mentally I just feel confused and forgetful all the time. It‚Äôs a struggle just to west a mask because I feel even more out of breath when I do, and it makes my anxiety flare up really bad. 

My biggest fear is I‚Äôve developed copd or emphysema. I‚Äôm around a family member who smokes a lot. Like a pack or so a day. 

Idk if this was a rant or a plea for help or what.. but Reddit always has some great advice. So yea.. help ‚òπÔ∏è"

"My inhaler steroids were not quite doing the trick so I got an inhaler that included a LABA. Previously I'd had no psych effects, just some breakthrough coughing. After starting with the LABA I became extremely irritable... Almost felt like I had anger issues, which is not normal for me. So I switched from that to another inhaler that the doctor said was basically the same, but might not have this side effect. However on that one I started having even weirder psych issues, like I didn't feel like anything was real and I was going through things in a weird haze. I think it might have been derealization? So I switched back to the other one and am now irritable again, but the weird dazed feeling went away. 

Both were a combo of inhaled corticosteroids and LABA. Is it possible for these to cause this type of psych issues?? I have posted here before but I didn't think they could cause such a range of problems.

Thanks!!"
"Used to have asthma as a kid, had a few attacks even and did carry an inhaler at some point with me at school. That was years ago, I'm an adult and idk if I still have it or not.

Though I've been seeing this doctor who idk if I trust completely because he's slightly dismissive and inappropriate w/ me (long story but I'm I'm pretty sure he likes me). He says I still have asthma and gave me an inhaler because I'm poor. 

We text and everything and I told him that earlier I felt weird, like a hard time breathing or something. I don't have mucus, I do have chest aches on my sides tho that might be from exercising yesterday planks and such etc. Anyways he told me to use the inhaler, should I?"
Hi everyone. I‚Äôve been using a. Breo Ellipta steroid inhaler for about six days now. I only got diagnosed with asthma last week. How long until the Breo starts to work? Right now I am still having to use my Albuterol once to twice a day. Shortness of breath is pretty constant though out the day right now. Thank you!

"Hi. I have asthma which is normally very well controlled, but I had a flare up last week culminating in an asthma attack yesterday. This is very uncommon for me and I am not bouncing back like I thought I would. I went to the hospital at the time and was given prednisolone, and another 2 days worth (my first time given this because of how rare it is for me to have a flare up). I was hoping to get some insights from those who might have more experience in recovery from an asthma attack. Specifically:

1. How long do you find it takes for you to feel well enough to work? I work a desk job and have been working from home since covid started.

2. Is it normal that I am still getting pain in my chest and back, even though I can now breathe easier because of the steroids? I am managing it with paracetamol. 

3. I feel tired but can't sleep. What the hell?

4. Why do I feel so upset by the whole thing? I know asthma attacks happen, I was seen quickly and my body responded well to treatment. I was released within 3 hours of being admitted. So why do I physically feel shit, and emotionally feel like a wreak?


For extra info, in case it is relevant. I am in the UK, I messaged my GP who said I can get more prednisolone if needed (is this likely?!) and to make an appointment for 4 weeks time with the asthma nurse. I am vaccinated but not sure which vaccine as I am a trial participant; related, because this was triggered likely by a cold type bug, I was given a PCR covid test by the vaccine trial and it was negative. I wasn't diagnosed with asthma until well into adulthood, after becoming a parent, although signs were there before. But it is normally so mild for me."
So yesterday I used a natural shampoo with essential oils mixed in for fragrance. I have had problems with my asthma since 16 I thought I would be okay with this since its natural. But after using it began uncontrollibly wheezing and had an itchy neck and ears. Do you think it is wise to avoid all products with essential oils in from now on. I never had previously had problems with essential oils until yesterday. I guess as I have gotten old my airways have gotten more sensitive. I used to be okay with lavender shampoo. But never atopic skincare with essential oils.i cant really use unnatural fragrances as I start wheezing also. But this reaction was worse then using those.
 Can you lay on the side without feeling breathless? Lately I have to lay on the back to avoid it
"Hello everyone, I'd like to know if anyone else experiences this: with the autumn coming, my asthma symptoms are flaring up again. But every year, it's the same. When I get a cold or a sore throat, and I basically feel under the weather from a virus, my asthma symptoms almost disappear. I've spoken to many doctors about this, and they all dismiss it as irrelevant, but I wonder whether it is significant for my diagnosis. What are your thoughts?

For info, I'm 46 and have had asthma most of my life. I'm taking inhaled steroids and long term bronchodilators. At the moment I'm struggling with a difficult to manage flare up, probably due to allergy to mould, as it's been really humid in Portugal where I live."

"Hi there. I‚Äôve been having been having some strange symptoms as of late and I‚Äôm wondering if it could possibly be asthma. 

Whenever I smell a strong or sharp scent, I get a weird claustrophobic smothering sensation. It doesn‚Äôt feel like my airways are actually physically constricted but it still feels like I‚Äôm smothering or being suffocated. Common triggers are exhaust fumes, strong perfume/deodorant, smoke from cooking, mold/mildew, citrus etc. It also induces anxiety 9/10 times which further exacerbates the sensation. I am prone to allergies so I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs any connection. 

When it happens I am still able to take deep breaths and exhale fully but I am not familiar with asthma at all so I‚Äôd appreciate some input."

"I'm somewhat allergic to (some) cats and have been able to live with them in the past with Zyrtec and Nasacort. Unfortunately I adopted one a few months ago that has been triggering my latent-since-childhood asthma. Been using an old albuterol inhaler for now, and I've accepted that giving up the cat is probably the solution, but wanted to first try some basic treatment, it seems like montelukast might be worth a shot?

"New to the forum but in need of help. A bit of background, I was diagnosed with childhood exercise induced asthma when I was very young and had a few inhalers over the years that I never really used much aside from the rare flare ups. I'm now 36 and over the last couple years, there have been a few days at a time where I'll notice my breathing is constricted a bit, usually on rainy days, but everything would go back to normal shortly thereafter.

About 2.5 months ago, I was sanding my crawlspace door, which happened to be quite mildewy, with a hand sander indoors which had a vacuum on it so I wasn't wearing a mask. I had used this sander many times in the past without a mask and without issue, albeit with new wood, not old, mildewy wood. Shortly after that, my asthma seemed to kick up into high gear and I had trouble getting a full breath with a dull ache in my chest, similar to a chest cold. I went to urgent care after it hadn't cleared up in a week and they didn't see or hear much in my lungs but prescribed amoxicillin just in case it was bacterial bronchitis. They didn't take a covid test as the symptoms didn't match up (didn't have a temp, O2 levels good, no loss of taste/smell, etc). I have not had covid.

Fast forward a month and I'm still experiencing more or less the same symptoms. Less in the way of not getting a full breath but more in the way of constant phlegm in the center of my lungs and a persistent cough, breathing still constricted. I saw an allergy/asthma specialist and he was mainly focused on the allergy component and thought that it was grass/trees/pollen of which I am very allergic to but take Singulair daily and haven't had much of an issue lately. To that he explained that it may have been kicked off by the sawdust powder and/or some allergins and suggested I take steroids for a month to address it. He prescribed prednisone and an ArmonAir digihaler. The prednisone was no issue to obtain but the inhaler was over $300 which I couldn't afford so he was generous enough to give a sample; problem is that it's 232 mcg, the largest dose. I haven't taken the prednisone because I read it can reduce immunity to covid and I'm afraid to jump right into the largest dose of the inhaler so I'm not sure what to do at this point.

Currently, I have essentially constant phlegm deep in my lungs and constricted breathing. I generally don't get the feeling that I can't breath lately but the lung issues are really starting to drive me crazy and leave me feeling drained and demotivated. Coughs are loud, hard and hurt by midday. Things generally aren't too bad in the morning and get worse throughout the day. Nothing really seems to help aside from cough drops as a momentary reprieve. Mucinex, cough syrup, etc do nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

My current questions for the asthma pros are as follows:

1. What has caused my asthma to kick up into high gear? Simply age or the sanding/allergy event?
2. Is it safe/smart to start on the largest dose of the ArmonAir? I've taken Flonase for years without issue and I'm not worried about side effect per se but rather the ramifications of jumping to a high dose steroid and getting off it after.
3. Is there any natural remedies anyone can suggest? I had an uptick in GERD so I started drinking ACV tonic (ACV, lemon juice, cinnamon, water) in the morning and it's really helped the GERD but hasn't much addressed the asthma issues. I've also tried a number of other natural meds like Mary Ruth's drops, Shilajit, Quercetin/Bromelain, etc without noticing much of a change. I eat fairly healthy with plenty of veggies and plan to lose more weight but I'm about 20 lb down in the last 4 mo and didn't have these issues before I lost the weight. I'm currently 6'1"", 205 lb.

Apologies for the much longer than anticipated message. I'm not used to participating in Reddit threads but the medical advice always seems to be relatable and well considered. Fingers crossed that someone can help!

"i know asthma medications are a kind of steroid and steroids are a kind of hormone, but i would just like to know if this is something to be worried about or not. i was put on asthma medications again after 10 or so years a few months ago and my notoriously regular and routinely period just went crazy right after starting my inhalers again."
Hello fellow asthmatics. I am currently one of the folks that is scared of the vaccine. I guess mainly because my sister in law is a Nurse and she told us not to get it and the stories she has told me about health adults getting fiercely ill after the vaccine. I have had asthma since I was little. Severe  asthma. I have been hospitalized about 20-30 times throughout my life for asthma but nothing in the past few years because I finally got it under control for the most part. I guess my question is: Did any one here get the vaccine and if you did which one and did you have any bad reactions. I‚Äôm more concerned with not being able to breathe after getting it. I work from home and I try not to go anywhere at all unless it‚Äôs necessary. My son also has asthma and he is currently doing homeschool as a result of us not wanting to take the vaccine out of fear from dying from it.
"Now I‚Äôm not asking for you guys to diagnose me or anything because i know you can‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt but i just want to make sure my concerns are valid or not.

So i‚Äôve had trouble running for pretty much any time longer than an estimated 10 seconds. If i need to run for a longer period of time i won‚Äôt be able to actually ‚Äúrun‚Äù due to the fact i‚Äôd pretty much run out of air. I‚Äôll also have a throbbing pain in my side after about a minute on a good day. So if i do need to run for several minutes in gym class for example, i‚Äôll have to ‚Äúrun‚Äù at more of a jogging speed that is not much faster than walking. I‚Äôll always be at the end of the entire group usually with quite some distance between. This is also the reason i hated tag as a kid, i could never tag anyone because i‚Äôd run out of stamina super fast, it felt like an unfair game. If i play hockey or soccer intensely i‚Äôll have a hard time getting in all the air from all the running and to recover from that i‚Äôll have to sit on a bench for a looong time.

The strange thing is that i ride my bike every schoolday, 11 km to school and back home. I do have an e-bike but still i should have a better stamina then this right? Even when i did have a normal bike doing the same distance my stamina was shit.

Should i get evaluated? Any other thoughts? I feel like this has just kind of been laughed off by my parents and teachers asjust ‚Äúbeing the kid with bad stamina‚Äù"
"Just got prescribed Dulera for my asthma(moderate) I usually take Albuterol when needed, but my asthma got worse this year and after having Covid it just hasn‚Äôt been the same before.

Any side effects I should be aware of?

Anyone else gained weight, or got anxiety from it? I don‚Äôt want to start if it‚Äôs going to take a toll on my mental health."

"I'm new to this, started Flovent and levalbuterol and last month.

Lately, both my inhalers, but especially the Flovent, don't seem to release a full puff even after shaking vigorously for 10 seconds. If I ""prime"" it by pumping it once or twice first, the next dose definitely comes out more strongly. But obviously I shouldn't have to waste a dose every time I use it (twice a day).

Is it normal for the puffs to seem less strong when the MDI is about halfway through? Am I still receiving a full dose, even though the blast of air seems significantly less forceful (unless I prime it first)?"
"I got really sick yesterday. Felt super out of it and exhausted, which evolved into chills, bad fever, vomiting, and chest pain (caused my an empty stomach and gas buildup and sitting still for two hours). I also started wheezing and being short of breath. 

Asthma is much worse today. Took my inhaler and nebulizer, but the nebulizer med expired in March (fluid is still colorless). 

I don't have a primary doc yet and am staying with my bf an hour away from my house. Any advice would help"
"I‚Äôm a 39 yr old female. 

So I was walking at the beach 2 weeks and slipped on some damp long grass. I knew instantly I‚Äôd winded myself, but the following day I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. 

I‚Äôm guessing that I‚Äôve broken a rib due to where the pain is and the symptoms I have. 

My issue is I‚Äôve been told by everyone to rest, but I don‚Äôt rest up very easily. I‚Äôm always finding something to do.

Since I fell this rib is playing tricks with my asthma in that I need my inhalers much more. It‚Äôs gradually getting tighter in my chest and feels heavier. Is this linked? One of my friends brother is an ambulance technician, and said to look out for an infection or worse pneumonia. I‚Äôd do anything to not get pneumonia again, I had it in 2019 and it floored me for so long resulting in my lungs being scarred and compromised.  

I‚Äôve called my GP and have been given steroids and antibiotics for a week now and I have another week to take. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping that much though! I still feel really chesty, have a cough and my peak flow is 350-400. I‚Äôve done covid tests and that‚Äôs clear. 

I‚Äôm starting to feel worried and everyone I talk to keeps saying I just need to rest. What do I do for the best and to heal this quickly???!  

P.S. is it normal to be in agony with rib whilst driving"
"So when I was  a little kid I was transported to the hospital because of an asthma attack, diagnosed with asthma, I had several allergies some of them disappeared with time. I was fat and trough mid-school I have always taken medication, at some point I lost weight and started doing high competition sport, leaving until college medication behind, did not need to take anything. Back to college, sometimes i needed to take the rescue inhaler. Now 25 I can go through the day without any medication, do sport  without inhaler, and I smoke during the day(yes I know!) and nothing happens, but if don't take my two puffs on my BiResp Spiromax before sleep I will wake up with thigh chest and wheezing , so even if when  I am going to sleep I am fine I have to take it. Another thing that appeared recently is that beer or wine immediately triggers my asthma !

Best Regards!"
"15F here 

I‚Äôm in the UK if that matters 

I developed mild asthma when I was 10, and was diagnosed at 13.

Recently, I got a cold. I had a dry cough for a while and then everything pretty much cleared up other than the fact I sound a little nasally (no sore throat, no runny nose ect.) but now I just have this horrible chesty cough. I‚Äôve had to use my inhaler a lot more than normal (I don‚Äôt really have to use it much at all, mainly after running or in hay fever season). Every time I talk or laugh, I end up in a cough and it sounds HORRIBLE. It isn‚Äôt rattly or anything, it more sounds like it‚Äôs coming from the depths of my lungs. It more sounds like a mix of an angry goose (hence my username) and a dog barking. I don‚Äôt have a fever or anything, maybe some post-nasal drip but I get post nasal drip a lot and I‚Äôve always been fine.

Could this be my asthma being triggered by my cold or could it have just turned into something else? Or am I just needlessly worrying? Please help I need advice on what to do."
"Hello i'm 26 years old and I've been coughing with white mucus everyday, this started when I'm 15 years old. In the morning my cough is at it worst but later on it will subside, i also feel that my throat is always itchy and needed to spit mucus.

This year I've been experiencing shortness of breath,
Sometimes it will last only a few hours and sometimes a whole week."
"i was diagnosed with mild asthma as a kid but have stopped taking my puffer as a teen/adult assuming i‚Äôve grown out of it.

lately i‚Äôve been taking it before my runs however my last run i didn‚Äôt take it and i was struggling the entire run.

Also i‚Äôve noticed that my singing ability is significantly better after i use my puffer.

my question is, am i still asthmatic or am i just giving my lungs a boost with my puffer and am ultimately hurting myself in the long run?"
"Just gonna go off for a second, my apologies. 

My asthma is so terrible. I don't know what to do about it anymore at this point. I go through two 200 dose xopenex inhalers every 3 months or so. 


Currently juuust about out of xopanex, but my new insurance needs a pre auth when I went to pick it up, and it's been almost a week and haven't gotten a desicion yet.

I'm supposed to be on symbicort 160/4.5 -- 2 puffs in the morning, 2 puffs at night. That doesn't always help, and it makes me feel like total garbage, and it's like $219 with insurance, would need one refilled either once or twice a month; can't remember which. Haven't been able to afford it in a long time, I have a few samples from when I lived in a different state, but I'm on my last one. 

If anyone has any natural prevention tips let me know, or any sort of prevention tip I don't care how natural it is at this point."

"First I got covid because im an idiot. Had it pretty bad for 5 days with difficulty breathing. I get scared after the ordeal, someone told me to start taking aspirin for bloodclots so I do(again im a dumbass). I spent over a week feeling fine then one day me and my girl drink some margaritas and i get drunk and fall asleep. Next day coughing a lot and short of breath, I thought the covid came back so I immediately set a doctor appointment for next week. 

By the time I go see her I mainly just have the cough and throat pain. She recommends albuterol and loratadine. **I take only one breath of the albuterol at home and after 30 minutes my heart rate goes up my legs cant stop shaking and I am breathing like my life depended on it, my lungs felt like they were on fire.** I didnt go to the ER because of sheer stupidity and cheapness. I spent the next 5 days feeling like I am dying, I couldnt breath and my whole chest felt like it was on fire.

I go see the DR again she has no idea whats going on, says maybe PE. I start taking Pepcid antacid that day and almost immediately I felt my breathing improve. Thats when I realized that what I have is stomach related. I start taking omeprazole and pepcid every day, eat only vegetables and raise the head of my bed, and the burning in my chest and throat almost go away completely after a few days. Unfortunately my breathing has not improved much and in fact some days It feels worse. 

Go see a pulmonary Doctor, says its bronchitis even though I have barely any cough and almost no mucus. Gives me a Spiriva inhalers, remembering what happened the last time I only take less than half a puff of the stuff. Everthing seemed fine my breathing felt a little better and I was very happy, next day I do not take it  and around 8pm I get some sort of asthma attack which I had never had before, it felt like a child was sitting on my chest. 

By midnight it gets better but b4 I go to sleep I decided to take 1 full puff of spiriva. I wake up 5 hours later(cant sleep much more than that now idk why) and my bladder feels like its ready to burst, I pee with much difficulty and have to force my bladder for more to come out. About an 1 hour later I pee again(quite a bit) much smoother. But I have noticed my breathing is shit, which is odd because I took that full puff of spiriva last night, I thought for sure my breathing would be even better than with less than half a puff.

Anyone have any valuable information for me? My doctors dont seem to know exactly what is going on and just keep recommending medicine that I feels ends up making things worse. I think what happened was that the aspirin gave me gerd and I aspirated some stomach acid under the influence of alcohol. Then I had that weird reaction to albuterol and probably aspirated even more stomach acid as I was taken nyquil every night to sleep. Im guessing my lungs have chemical burns from the acid and is causing some sort of inflammation that is making it hard for me to breathe. 

**Should I keep taking the spiriva? I read that bladder problems is one of the side effects, but I am more scared that I will have some sort of allergic reaction to it that shows up slowly over weeks of use.** Or that when I stop taking it the symptoms will just come back even harder than before. I have already done so much damage to my lungs. Any help would be highly appreciated I was such a happy go lucky person and the last 2 months have sent me on a depression spiral where my mind is always in the worst. All Im hoping now is that the damage that I did is not permanent and I can go back to being slightly normal."
"I‚Äôm bouncing between various possible causes of my symptoms because my doctor is trying out all options. I have shortness of breath that occured suddenly and a cough that produces clear sticky phlegm but the cough only really occurs during the day and when I am upright. The shortness of breath persists when I lay down, but the cough quickly goes away when I lay down. I hear a lot of people with asthma have nocturnal cough and worsening of symptoms when laying down. I also am looking into GERD, but many people with GERD experience nocturnal coughs as well. I‚Äôm just trying to see how common daytime coughs (and upright) are amongst asthmatics here? Thank you so much!"
"Hey y'all,

I'm currently visiting my partner's family in Tennessee. I've been having what I'm pretty sure is stressed induced asthma for the past few days (we had to put my dog down a couple days ago and i think I probably wasn't taking care of myself as well as normal). I only have shortness of breath/wheezing, no other symptoms at all. I had been getting relief with Albuterol but as of last night, it has only helped a little bit. I don't have a nebulizer and my doctor is in Massachusetts. 

I'm so worried about going to an ER or urgent care due to Covid. I am double vaxxed but even a slight cold can flare my asthma for weeks so I've been super careful. I'll have to take my mask off no matter what if I go in. Only 49% of the county is vaccinated. What do y'all think? Is it worth going in? Should I just keep taking my Albuterol consistently and resting until it flares down or take the risk?"
"27M - Broken Immune System after COVID vaccine?

Hi all, it‚Äôs my first time here posting here. I‚Äôm 27 years old, 180cm tall and have a weight of 75kg. I live in Germany and am usually pretty active (exercise 3x a week). Stopped smoking 2 years ago. Never had any allergies diagnosed, but in the last couple of years I had a lot of sneezing which didn‚Äôt really bother me. Here comes my problem:

Beginning of July 2021 I started coughing occasionally, like 3-4 times a day. Nothing I was really worried about. Then, end of July I received my second shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. I had no issues after the first shot besides a migraine. After the second shot I also had no issues for the first few days. But four days after the shot, I woke up in the morning and couldn‚Äôt breathe at all. After like 20 seconds of not being able to breathe I started coughing heavily and had shortness of breath. I went to ER, they diagnosed a beginning Pneumonia. I took amoxicillin for 10 days but the coughing and shortness of breath didn‚Äôt get better. I had no fever or whatsoever, which is not typical for a pneumonia, right? Then, 3 days after my last pill of amoxicillin the symptoms actually got better. A week later I felt great again, went out with my buddies, we drank a lot of alcohol. The next day I had a relapse. Shortness of breath and coughing. Since then (3weeks) I basically fight against what I think might be pneumonia, but it with milder symptoms than the first time. On top of it I got a sinusitis 3.5 weeks ago which went away after 2 weeks. I have constant shortness of breath eversince. Did lung function test beginning of September which was totally fine the pulmonologist told me. Last week Sunday I was admitted to the ER with an acute dyspnea. I had high inflammation in the bloodwork, however the CT of Thorax was clear. Nevertheless, I now take different antibiotics for 10 days and need to inhale Pulmicort in the morning and the evening. Doctors say it‚Äôs either atypical Pneumonia, but the Clear CT normally rules this out. On the other hand it could be Asthma they say, but they doubt that as well as I always had high inflammation in blood when I had the attacks of dyspnoe. Also, after each of those attacks it takes me like 2 weeks to being able to deeply breath in fully without burning in my throat and coughing. Beforehand all was fine but since the vaccine I have the feeling of not getting better at all and new stuff is coming on top. 
Has anyone else heared of a weakened immune system after the vaccination? I‚Äôm still pro vaccine and would always do it again, but at the moment I‚Äôm devastated because I‚Äôm not getting better :( 
Any ideas what I could have?"
How long does it take to control asthma?? i have been on inhaled corticosteriod for past 3 months..last month my doctor switched me to combination medication(laba+corticosteriod)...Slightly better but still having daily symtopms.i have been on medication for past 4 months..Help me out plz
Don‚Äôt have my inhaler on me and am having a hard time breathing and honestly probably can‚Äôt even sleep if I wanted to but if u could would it be dangerous? I have a big fear of what could happen to me while im sleeping.

"I am feeling breathless for years..visited many doctors and noone found nothing apart from PVC's(tachycardia)..until recently I went to a pulmologist and she did so many tests and said I have""a possible start of bronchial asthma"" and she prescribed me singulair. I didn't start drinking it yet..I am scared. How is it possible that after so many lung tests she doesn't know do I have asthma or not ? I don't know what to do..I feel TERRIBLE with this constant breathlessness but all other doctors told me its anxiety.

What to do..please give me some advice. :("
"I have had asthma for a long time.  I was diagnosed in my late teens, but I think it goes back even as far as elementary school.   I was always reasonably fit and a completely normal weight up until I graduated high school.  Despite asthma I competed in several sports and did find with medication. 


Once I got out on my own the weight started to come on and I am decidedly overweight now.  I got fat as an adult and now I am ashamed to admit I have asthma or use my medications in front of people because I feel like they‚Äôre judging me and assuming I don‚Äôt have asthma, I‚Äôm just out of breath because I‚Äôm fat. 

Yes being fat certainly isn‚Äôt helping; but I had asthma before I got fat and I wish I didn‚Äôt feel so self conscious about it."

"Some notable quotes from the Dr:

""Asthma attacks are only attacks if they last for several days at a time without a break"" (wouldn't you die then?????)

\*mocking wheezing, very high pitched, flailing arms\* ""Is that what you do? No? Well then you don't have asthma."" (I've been diagnosed by 3 separate doctors for over 4 years now)

""If you aren't constantly wheezing then you don't have asthma, even after using a rescue inhaler you should be wheezing if you were REALLY asthmatic"" (this was after I'd been given a steroid treatment by the nurses, and he came in after the fact when my attack was subsiding and listened to my breathing)

\*lifts up my shirt to listen to my lungs without warning or asking first\* (which is honestly just rude and uncomfortable, especially since I'm AFAB and a survivor of abuse)

""I don't think you have asthma at all. You shouldn't have any treatment for it. You're just stressed and I am 90% confident in saying this... but then you could also be having a heart attack but I won't follow up with tests to confirm that"" (?????????????)

\*after I ask for a CT scan to make sure my lungs don't have a growth or anything in them since he clearly doesn't think it's asthma\* ""What for? You're not Really having breathing troubles, you're just having chest pain and shortness of breath."" (?????????????????)

Is this what all ER visits for our asthma is like? I had to wait 2 hours while struggling to breathe and had an attack while there (when the nurses gave me steroids) but the doctor was so unpleasant I almost don't wanna push for any further treatment even though I know my current treatment plan isn't effective enough anymore :( He also put in my chart (I requested access to it) that I had a panic attack (I did not.) and cited my neurological issues (I have a brain deformity) as the reason for my ""condition"" (which he believes is just panic disorder/anxiety).

Anyone else ever have bad experiences? Should i go to a different hospital? Should I report him? The steroids the nurses gave me helped and I was able to walk home after but idk. He did refer me to pulmonology (at my insistence) but warned me he would be indicating in his referral that he didn't think it was necessary (I could not get access to this to confirm of he actually did write that). 

just... :("
"I've been on it 2 days, and I've seen ok-ish improvement, but not really enough tbh. The sad part is I'm on the last day of a 5 day 20 mg pred course right now too."
"I've noticed every few days I'll have a ""coughing fit"" where I cough for 2-3 minutes pretty hard. Sometimes it lasts even longer. I never have to sit down or wheeze hard, it's just a lot of coughing. I thought it was just my body trying to clear out the mucus, but today I took my albuterol and I had the ""lungs are clearing up"" feeling.

I am too old to be realizing this now, but are those coughing fits are my asthma kicking in and the cue to take the albuterol?

My whole life I've been given albuterol but tried to never take it because I was told it could be overused and only for asthma attacks (from what I've seen on YouTube, I don't have those attacks where I have to sit down or am breathless). I had asthma since I was a kid. My parents are immigrants and had no idea what the docs were saying when I get prescribed medicine. Growing up I never really used them the way I was supposed to, and when I got renewed prescriptions my doc never told me when to use them, which I should probably talk to him about next time I see him.

Any thoughts? When do you use albuterol?"
"So I don't really have asthma attacks per se. I just have SOME asthma all the time. Albuterol helps of course, but only for a few hours at a time. I run through an inhaler in about 2 weeks usually. Its a lot of mucus in my lungs and almost perpetual wheezing. I've tried different meds, recently Dupixent which did zilch. My doc is looking at Xolair next. 

Anyone else got this same kind of asthma?"
"I got a Magnesium drip at the ER today for my asthma attack. Does anyone know if it would be beneficial overall to take magnesium supplements to help with the symptoms? 

Thanks for any advice!!"
Hi! I‚Äôm a 31 year old female who was recently diagnosed with RAD after bad smoke exposure from my oven. Pretty sure I inhaled plastic. It happened about a month ago and my life has been derailed ever since. I was given an inhaler by urgent care but that didn‚Äôt seem to do much. Then my partner brought home some kind of bug and she was over in in a couple of days but it totally messed me up and my lungs suddenly felt like they were barely working. I would wake up gasping and couldn‚Äôt breathe. I thought I was dying in my sleep. Certainly felt like it. Finally made it to see a pulmonologist and did a breathing test. I passed and the x ray shows my lungs as normal. He said I probably have RAD and that it will take time for my lungs to heal from that but it will go away. He also said it is possible that I could still have this type of reaction a year from now. When I first got an X-ray right after it happened they said my lungs and everything else didn‚Äôt look damaged at all. Just lots of inflammation. So my question is does RAD actually ever go away? From what I can tell it doesn‚Äôt and it can kill you. Will I always have to use inhalers? I was normal before this happened and I‚Äôm so angry at life.
I just went to urgent care for an exasterbation and thr Dr advised me to ask my PCP for Singulair since my asthma ID triggered by a lot of things. I never knew they could prescribe asthma meds. I get my inhaler from them but I thought that was it. I went to this crappy specialist last year hoping for a script but he didn't give me one. So I've just been suffering this whole time for nothing?
"Who designed this and how do I uninstall?

I almost had to go to the ER last night because I had several attacks in a row- probably should've gone but didn't wanna overwhelm the hospital further (covid, nursing shortage, etc.)

"If anyone can pitch in as I am finding very little information about this on the internet. From what I see it IS a bronchodilator, but it's not used for that specific purpose. It seems this chemical compound is meant to be used long term, every day (and for better results, in conjunction with Albuterol) for the treatment of Bronchitis and COPD. Now my lack of understanding is in regards to exactly how effective this medication really is with an Asthma attack. I have had Asthma my entire life and I've never heard or seen any mention of it by any medical professionals in regards to Asthma, they always ever only point to Albuterol as a viable solution. Another thing I found to be interesting is that this medicine is actually recommended to patients that have over-sensitivity to Albuterol in particular, but as of scouring the web for some linkable answers, one specific website stated that it is not recommended as a substitute because it does not illicit a fast enough reaction time in the pulmonary system to effectively combat an asthmatic episode. However, I find absolutely ZERO information on how long it takes, how it differs from Albuterol in terms of speed and what the effects are supposed to feel like. I have read the entire booklet the medicine box comes with, and it still doesn't quite answer any of these questions.. For an FDA approved medicine, the data just isn't really there...... Or maybe it's on some obscure page I can't seem to find."
"Background: I am in the middle of diagnosing asthma. I have been prescribed a rescue inhaler for what I think is mild asthma that flares up every now and then. Sometimes after using my Albuterol inhaler I will end up coughing 15-20 minutes later and I can breathe better. Other times after using it I will have no reaction and just be able to breathe better. I am confused if it is actually helping for what it is intending or if these are just side effects? Can anyone tell me what is supposed to happen when you use your rescue inhalers, such as Albuterol?"

"This is a bit of a long story so I‚Äôll do my best to keep it as short as possible. I am 24 and vapes for two years (the docs have not said much about the vaping and i have not done it for over a month now.) Last year, around March/April I began to have shortness of breath (never had an issue of any kind before then. So I went to the Doctor and got a COVID test-negative. He prescribed me an inhaler and sent me to get a PFT. The PFT came back normal and the shortness of breath was not very bad. I learnt to live and deal with it and did not have to pay much attention to it‚Ä¶. Until about a month ago. 15-16 months later I am sitting on my couch and out of no where BAM, I cannot breath, I am dizzy, and a bit confused. This lasted into the next day and I was able to get into a doctor. He prescribed me a Symbicort inhaler and scheduled a heart echo. The echo was normal and the Symbicort helped, until it started to give me anxiety and depression. Extrema anxiety and depression. I stoped using the inhaler and the anxiety and depression toned down but the shortness of breath came back. I found a new doctor and she wanted me to get a new PFT test done. Well this morning I got the results and my doctor said I have ‚Äúmild obstructive disease‚Äù and that is constant with mild-asthma. She called me in a new steroid inhaler to try, Breo Ellipta. She said she wanted me to try it and hopefully it won‚Äôt affect my mental health as bad as the Symbicort. 
So after I got the diagnoses I went straight to Google and Google told me that ‚Äúmild obstructive disease‚Äù is COPD and it‚Äôs not good. I replied to my doctor with what I found and her nurse responded telling me my doctor said it is ‚Äúmild asthma.‚Äù So what I need help with is do I actually have mild asthma? I have been having the hardest time the last month because of my breathing problems. And will my new steroid inhaler affect my mental health the same way the Symbicort did? That inhaler really messed me up. Thank you for your help!"

"I have a dose of Nucala in the fridge right now. It‚Äôs due on the 26th. My power has been out for three and a half hours now, and the power company says it‚Äôs going to be another three before they get it back on. Nobody in the house has opened the fridge since well before the power went out.

I can‚Äôt just take it to a friend‚Äôs house, since I have a cold and my covid results are pending. Add to this my asthma is flared because of said cold, and I have no clue if that affects when I can take the nucala (I sent a message to my doctor, but idk when she‚Äôll answer). Oh, and did I mention my nebulizer needs wall power to run? (I have an inhaler that‚Äôs doing the job for now)

WWYD?"
"Lately I have been sighing a lot in an effort to get enough air. Does anyone else experience that with asthma? I know it‚Äôs not anxiety, and I always had it when my asthma got worse"
"A bit of googling found me an article or two about how corticosteroids can alter the amount of serotonin in the brain and mimic ADHD symptoms. I don't know what it is, but I feel like I can't focus on anything.

It got worse at first when my asthma started, but I assumed it was just the condition weighing me down or the symptoms bothering me and causing brain fog. I've been on advair for 8 months, but about 6 of those I was very inconsistent with my medication, only taking half the doses I needed (usually just in the morning and I would never get around to the afternoon dose, or I'd just flat out forget) or less. These last few months I've been trying to really on my ass about it because I know I need to be consistent, but I feel like my focus has gotten worse. I can't tell if it's this though.

A couple of months ago, I was anemic; I have since tested out of that after taking iron supplements. This caused an extreme lack of focus for a few weeks. While I was recovering from that, I started buspirone for anxiety, which gave me a bad reaction and I also had a hard time focusing because of that.

Now I don't have either of those issues and I still can't focus. Has anyone else had these issues with inhalers? I'm on advair atm."
"My rescue inhaler cause a sever amount of muscle soreness and general aching when I use it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I gues this explains why I got into flexibility routines... anyways, is there anything to do after having to use it that lessens the pain or ways to prevent it. I am not interested in taking pain medication or anything like that."

So my husband has this mucus stuck in throat feeling for days and dry cought for months  and when he was checked he was diagnosed with mild asthma with very high ige 1000s .. could it be reason for his mucus feeling in throat?
"Ugh. Just one of those days. The chest pain, the tightness, the crying because you hate asthma, the crying whole starting your nebulizer because you are scared. I just absolute hate it. 

That is all. Sorry. Had to rant to people who get it because no one else understands what it‚Äôs like to not be able to simply breathe."

"Hello wheezy friends! I recently moved to an apartment that has a centralized air system, which is new for me. I already have a couple basic standing air purifier units, but does anyone have a recommendation for something that would help with air coming out of the ducts themselves? Keep in mind that because this is an apartment, I can't really do a ton of maintenance on the ducts themselves. Any recommendations welcome!"
"Im not talking about the results from taking your ventolin or beta2 agonists.

But just in general, does narrowing airways have effect on BP/HR ?"

"I have, up to this year, quite mild asthma. This last 2 weeks my Fostair hasn't been alleviating my symptoms sufficiently and the last couple of days I've been getting pains in my chest, under my armpits and around my breasts. Are these pains asthma related, should I see my Dr?"
Well I took prozac ssri and I had suicidal thoughts now being off for 4 weeks now I wonderd why I still have them just less and I found that my flutiform or fluticasone interacts with it so I'm gonna book an appointment with the asthma nurse cause I have a suspicion that it may have interacted and gave me the side effect and the reason why it's still going is because we'll they have interacted and it won't metabolise as it should so I'll ask if there is another medication I can take till I get better cause other people in different subs get better within a week

"It felt so silly before I was asked about it at the doctors office, but if I laugh too hard I will get short of breath, start coughing, then get wheezy. It makes it scary for me to laugh too hard because I hat  at t having a really difficult time breathing. One time I laughed really, really hard and was coughing all the next day. 
 
Does this happen to anyone else????"
My girlfriend's dad is having a thick persistent cough lately. I was wondering if he can use a nebulizer to help him sleep?
Has anyone had it? My doctor and I agreed it would be good for me to get it.
"Last year was my first time having oral steroid. Last year did 2 packs of methylprednisolone and had shots in the hospital 2-3 times (once Dexamethasone).

This is is my first time this year having to take a pack. It's Prednisone, my first time taking Prednisone. Doesn't seem as effetive. Could it because Prednisone isn't as strong as methylprednisolone &amp; Dexamethasone?

I thought you had to be on oral steroids everyday for years to start to become resistant to them??"
"It‚Äôs been a day since my asthma attack- it was the worst one that I‚Äôve had, and I had to deal with it at home because my dad was at work (he did come home to take me to the hospital but by the time that he got home my asthma attack was calming down)

Now I have really bad lower chest pains, in the diaphragm area. Is this normal? Should I be at work? Should I seek medical attention? 
I think it‚Äôs just cause I had to put so much effort into breathing that my chest muscles are sore, but I‚Äôm not sure"

"I was told to clean it once a month originally... I brought it to the pharmasist to check out and he said it was clogged with medicine and thats why it wasnt working. He said to clean it once a week and let it

""air dry""

&amp;#x200B;

I cleaned it yesterday morning and let it air dry. Then I needed it today (my lung capacity is 7.7L so I require 4 dosages at a time) I used it 4 times in the morning... then needed it again... then noticed wheezing after an hour of using 4 dosages. I went to use it and thought to pul the carterage out of the inhaler, it was absolutly rock solid with medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an aero- chamber spacer, but like should it be cleaned after every use? Have I been getting false information about how often to clean it?"
So went in for PFT yesterday. After a few tests the respiratory therapist had me use my inhaler and then we did a few more tests. She said I only improved a tiny bit after using the inhaler. I feel like that should be normal right? I mean if my lungs weren‚Äôt constricted then the inhaler can‚Äôt dilate them and therefore the inhaler didn‚Äôt actually do anything and therefore my capabilities wouldn‚Äôt have changed? My appointment with the pulmonologist is Friday but I was wondering if anyone else had any experience with this.

"Hello, newbie to Reddit here, looking for help, any help.

About 2 years ago I had an asthma attack that was left untreated (not going to say any details as I have already known about my stupidity and I put myself in a dangerous situation). I have grown up with allergy induced asthma. All types of grass, pollen, trees, cats, dogs, dust mites, and farm animals trigger it. Growing up I couldn‚Äôt even go outside without needing an inhaler. Got allergy shots for about a year and as I got older I eventually didn‚Äôt even need an inhaler. Until one day, after years of not having any asthma, I had an asthma attack, No inhaler. It was between 3-4 hours that I struggled breathing. To this day I need an inhaler ATLEAST once a day. I have tried any and every inhaler from budesonide to albuterol to even primatene mist. It‚Äôs a constant feeling of dyspnea without wheezing 99% of time. Weird thing is, I have a high level of fitness. Run 10-15 miles a week and workout 6 out of 7 days without any difficulty to breathe. It‚Äôs only when resting I have shortness of breathe. My allergies are under control as I have eliminated all environmental allergens and take two antihistamines a day. I have also tied various types of antianxiety meds. I take lots of fish oil vitamin d and c. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs airway remodeling, and permanent structural damage to my lungs. I have also tried breathing techniques which help a little. If anyone has any advice or wants to point me in the right direction, it means more then you know. Thanks."
"Hi,

Just got an at home nebulizer, been taking 1.25mg albuterol every 4 hours as prescribed. It‚Äôs working! But I also noticed my chest, neck, and back are killing me they are so sore. Is this a side effect of albuterol?

FYI I am also taking budesonide via nebulizer."
"I started working out again about a week ago and today specifically, I woke up from my sleep after weight training my shoulders and abs + 20 minutes of incline walking and my lungs are now hurting really bad. About halfway through a breath, it hurts! I was wondering if anyone else had this experience after prolonged inactivity. I have already scheduled a covid test to be safe. I‚Äôm pretty scared because I‚Äôve never experienced this before (I was very active prior to 2020 when my gym closed). My muscles are sore of course and I‚Äôm wondering if the chest soreness is from the cardio (my BPM was around 160-170). Has anyone else experienced this? What helped and how long did it persist? I took 2 puffs of my Ventolin which helped some slight wheezing I had. Should I take a couple puffs before working out? I have a nebulizer and some prednisone too for emergencies and have not touched those yet. Any insight is welcome!"
"I used to use Flovent when I was younger but once I hit my late teens (about ten years ago) my asthma had improved to the point that I stopped using it and only needed my rescue inhaler about once a year or so. 

Something about the pandemic (being stuck inside my crappy moldy apartment combined with less physical activity, probably) caused my asthma to flare up really bad to the point that I was using my Albuterol inhaler practically daily, so I talked to my doctor a few weeks ago and renewed my Flovent prescription. Ever since I started using it again, my voice has been really weak and my vocal cords feel swollen. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? I've read that it's a common side effect that usually resolves itself, but how long should I wait before talking to my doctor?"
"Hi,

I just wanted to ask those of you with mild to medium asthma about which one of the two worked better for you? I understand that Symbicort is more powerful for most, but it also has way more people here discussing side effects around the heart which is a scary place to have unwanted effects. That almost makes it sound like those who can do with just ordinary Budesonide, are kind of lucky. 

Has anyone tried to manage side effects by for example restricting Symbicort to the mornings, and sticking with Pulmicort in the evenings because it doesnt interfere with heart rate/sleep? Or combining it with a pill so they could lower the inhaler dose?

I have already learned that the most potent solution is not always the one that gives you the best overall quality of life, so what did you end up with if you had to compromise?"
"I feel whenever I eat badly or eat more than usual and I get heart burn my breathing becomes terrible and I scramble to take an anti-acid medicine along with my abuterol, is this a known thing, and what diet really helped to improve it, just eating better overall? Or just eating less maybe? Or maybe a specific diet that works well"
"Weather is crazy in my country. Sometimes it's raining, then after 5 minutes, the sun is up again. Inhaler is not effective so a doctor prescribed tons of meds, one of which is doxofylline.

Few weeks ago, I just finished my omeprazole/pantoprazole meds for acid reflux/nausea. Stomachache is lesser now compared last month and I was scheduled to stomach ultrasound but I have to postpone it because of frequent asthma attack. Now I have to take doxofylline twice a day, plus antihistamine, Maalox and another med for gastrointestinal bleeding. Will doxofylline irritate my tummy? Does it have extreme side effect like antibiotics that can cause nausea and acid reflux?"
"27/F, diagnosed with asthma when I was 5.  Mostly indoor allergy and exercise-induced.  Just one year ago, this phlegm dilemma started. One day, every few weeks, I wake up and cannot breathe.  My inhaler does NOTHING.  It is this clear, thick phlegm about the consistency of the jello at China buffets.  I cough and cough and cough and it requires a hot shower to essentially get a breath.  Then I am coughing all day and the phlegm comes out one tiny piece at a time.  It is extremely annoying.   I drink about 100 oz of water daily so I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm dehydrated.  It is not exercise-induced and my indoor allergies are under control.  I ate a lot of pizza last night and am now thinking cheese could be the culprit??  Does anyone ever experience this phlegm thing and do you have any advice?  (My doctor recommended Flonase but I  haven‚Äôt noticed any help from it.)

Thank you for any input."
"Ok so why do all steroids made by man have compounds that closely resemble cortisol but no inhalers have the actual cortisol chemical formula?

If any steroid inhalers had the actual cortisol chemical formula, then that steroid inhaler would work for EVERYBODY because no one's cells don't respond to the real cortisol chemical formula, it's just fake cortisol, some people's body will accept, and others will reject. If any steroid inhalers cotained real cortisol, then we wouldn't have to go steroid inhaler shopping with trial and error BS."
"My doctor switched me to a turbuhaler after diskus did no work for me, why don‚Äôt I feel the medicine coming in my mouth? It‚Äôs just air?

"I just recently got diagnosed with asthma, I just got my inhaler but I have a few questions.

"i went there and i know i have athsma i went so maybe he could prescribe me a better inhaler or stronger one or put me on albuterol tablets or get me surgery to repair my lungs or something you know? he said the onlyt hing u could have is athsma  im like no shit  sherlock! in my mind im like my daily and emergcy doe not feel like t hey are useful at all at least my emergency sucks, i showed him my   inhaling technique , he told me to exhail and as suck as i start to breath in puff once and only once, im like  ok  i did that before but doesnt seem to help, he said give it a try for am onth with his way of doing it because i did it almost half way in a breath i did it alittle late but i still want somthing that makes me feel better you know?"
"Basically the title, I had an asthma attack that was the worst that I've had in years, I literally got my dad to come home from work to take me to the hospital (my asthma was manageable by the time he got home though) and it scared me so much. Im usually the person to tough it out and sit back and relax until it passes, I breath slow and deep etc. but this one my body tensed up and I couldn't relax. I took a lot of Ventolin - more than what is recommended, maybe 15 puffs within 30 mins because it was not helping and I needed to breath- 

Usually when I go to the hospital for asthma attacks (from what I remember) they do something similar? Lots of puffs of inhalers and medication, but this is monitored. 

I have bad health related anxiety too, and I found some people saying that Ventolin can be dangerous, and now im really worried :( My chest hurts on and off, though it might be because of the horrible asthma attack, and I can feel my heart beating. I did also have coffee because caffeine helps my asthma calm down as well.

someone please tell me that I am being dumb and overthinking, and that I'll live :,)"

"Hello everyone!

I can always tell I need to take my symbicort soon because the hour before I'm supposed to take it I'll start having mild asthma symptoms, usually coughing and chest tightness, and if I miss the dose by even 10 minutes I start coughing up clear phlem and my upper back begins to hurt (but this pain could also be due to my scoliosis so????).

My doctor at the time of diagnosis didn't explain much to me, and this is a new development- is this normal? Is my controlling inhaler not working as well as it should be? Should i up my dose? I haven't been having anymore asthma attacks than normal but it does seem like my lungs are a ticking time bomb and I'm just waiting for the next dose of my controlling inhaler to prevent an attack.

Thank you!"
"I (F 25) have had asthma since I was a little kid, was on preventers till my late teens when my asthma started getting better, now I only have my reliever (salbutamol). I generally only need to use my reliever when I have allergic reactions (dust mites and cats) or when I have a cold. 

Sometimes when I have a bad cold I had my GP prescribe me inhalers containing steroids and that would help me get my asthma back under control within a week.

I had a cold about three weeks ago and subsequent worsening asthma symtoms, needed my reliever several times per day and night, my doctor prescrbed me Foster 200/6 which I take twice a day. It helped relieve my symptoms within a couple of days but now my problems been stagnant for about a week. 

I don't have any acute symptoms anymore, I just feel like I can't take full breathes (like if my full breathing capacity would be a 10/10 im at a 7/10) a tight feeling on my chest as well as a light burning sensation in my lungs.

The thing is that right after my cold I had a stomach bug, which had me throwing up for about a day. I dont have a GERD diagnosis but do struggle with reflux from time to time but Ive never felt like it impacted/triggered my Asthma.

I also feel like my anxiety might be contributing to it because I cant stop focusing on my breathing and am hyperaware of everything that 'feels off'. I took my anxiety medication yesterday and I felt better after for a while.

I'm mostly just stressing myself out because Im not used to my asthma attacks/relapses taking this long, so I would appreciate to hear from people who have had similar experiences.

I would normally just go see my GP but he's on vacation till the end of the month."
"I have allergic asthma and my symptoms are mostly shortness of breath, fatigue and a runny nose. What are yours if you suffer from allergic asthma? And do you cough a lot or feel constant tightness in your chest?"
"As I reach for my inhaler to get that breath I so desperately need, I take the cap off and take a really big breath. What I didn't see is all the fluff and dirt that's collected inside while lying around in the car, bag and bedside table, so actually, I find myself coughing and spluttering before getting some air back in me.

What am I doing wrong? Why is the fluff there and doesn't anyone else have this problem? What do you do to fix it?

"I‚Äôm a 39 yr old female. 

So I was walking at the beach last week and slipped on some damp long grass. I knew instantly I‚Äôd winded myself, but the following day I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. 

I‚Äôm guessing that I‚Äôve broken a rib due to where the pain is and the symptoms I have. 

My issue is I‚Äôve been told by everyone to rest, but I don‚Äôt rest up very easily. I‚Äôm always finding something to do. This is the first day I‚Äôve properly rested and it hasn‚Äôt really helped any, in fact it‚Äôs more sore. 

Since I fell this rib is playing tricks with my asthma in that I need my inhalers much more. It‚Äôs gradually getting tighter in my chest and feels heavier. Is this linked? One of my friends brother is an ambulance technician, and said to look out for an infection or worse pneumonia. I‚Äôd do anything to not get pneumonia again, I had it in 2019 and it floored me for so long resulting in my lungs being scarred and compromised.

"I am suffering from Asthma since I was a little child. Usually I only get asthmatic attacks when doing cardio or from other physical strain, but not from allergies (although I have quite a few). Usually this only happens when I didn't inhale cortisone in the morning or when it'S very humid. However sometimes, I get similar symptoms to my asthmatic attacks (not as bad as 'typical' attacks, but over a longer period) in combination with digestion problems / stomachache / diarrhea (mostly in the evening or when waking up at night). This happened like 7-8 times already so it does not coincidentally  overlap, but it is somehow related. Sometimes I can even predict the other thing to happen once one of the symptoms occurs (i.e. I am short of breath and know I will get stomachache / diarrhea soon or I have stomachache and feel like I will get an asthmatic attack soon). Now my question is: Do any of you experience the same? Is this normal / common for asthmatics? And is there an explanation for this phenomenon?"
"I have recently been diagnosed with asthma (took way too long because no doctors listened). I've had an inhaler for a little while and I'm wondering how to tell when it's empty.

"Hi,

I am new with this. I‚Äôve had asthma ever since I was a kid but it was mild and exercise + cold air induced. My attacks would last like 1 hour and be gone. 

Over the past week I got a cold (not covid) which triggered this new asthma attack which has lasted 6 DAYS. 

It happened so gradually that I didn‚Äôt realize it was an emergency until I couldn‚Äôt talk anymore and I had to strain my neck to breathe. I went to urgent care and they gave me prednisone. Then 2 days later I was still not doing well so I went back and they gave me 2 nebulizer treatments with albuterol and atrovent. 

Last night I was still coughing uncontrollably and having dreams that I was drowning, waking up coughing, so I went back today. They just gave me a prescription for a nebulizer and some cough suppressant pills. 

I guess I‚Äôm having a hard time because the doctor I saw today was kind of a jerk. The past 2 were great and took my seriously, this guy was just like ‚Äúwell these can last for weeks, and you‚Äôre not like wheezing your brains out right now, so eh. It is what it is‚Äù 

I‚Äôm so confused though. This feels like an emergency to me. I should be able to breathe, this shouldn‚Äôt be lasting days. I don‚Äôt know what to expect. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. I do know my body and that this is so not normal or ok. 

Just some anecdotal advice or stories about what you did when this happened to you would help. What should I expect?"

"Hello All,

I wanted to share something that has worked/helped me immensely. 

I am a new allergic asthma sufferer that started this year in January. I am 39 M. 

I am on preventative inhalers - I rotate between symbicort / qvar / Breo. Each one gives me side effects.  I take montelukast and Flonase and claritin daily. 

Anyway I have tried every supplement/vitamin to try and reduce inflammation in my body not just my lungs. Like turmeric ginger you name it. When allergens are high I just feel so sluggish and I just want to sit on the couch. This has led to weight gain from inactivity.  And more weight leads to more inflammation. 

I tried intermittent fasting a few weeks ago and it has changed my life dramatically. It has driven down my inflammation so that I can be active again. 

All I do is keep to a schedule of 20/4. I only eat in a 4 hour window. Like I‚Äôll eat a meal at 4pm and then 8pm. Or try to eat one meal a day.  And limiting sugars and carbs helps as well. 

I feel like my old self again. Anyways if you feel helpless and have tried everything to help your allergic asthma and nothing is working. Try intermittent fasting. 

Obviously do your research on it. But it has worked for me and I plan to stick to it. There is a fasting subReddit and intermittent fasting subreddit as well. In case you wanted other communities as well. 

Hope this helps at least one person."
"I was diagnosed with mild infrequent asthma (allergy and viral induced) last year.  

My allergy triggers are dust and tree mold. The tree mold allergy is pretty bad. Around this time last year is when I developed bronchitis from the tree mold (leaves falling and leaf piles). It happened 2 more times before the end of the year.  

So my considering all of that, is it a good idea to keep the windows open during this time of the year?? It's beautiful outside but doesn't seem a good idea with a lil the leaves falling and leaf piles forming.  

Anyone have any input?? Thanks in advance!"
Wouldn't it be advisable to dose it more than twice a day for a stable concentration?
"Hey guys, relatively new diagnosis and basically just need to know I'm not alone or going crazy or anything. 
I've been having difficulties breathing for eight weeks but it took three of those to actually get to asthma. I've been on Prednisone (off now), clarithromycin antibiotics, Ventolin, Symbicort inhaler, Spiriva inhaler and injection steroids as well at the doctors. None of this has fixed it up in the last five weeks and I'm at the end of my rope a bit. My heart rate is still uncomfortably high doing anything (not sure if just the Symbicort, as this was an initial symptom before medication) and super high if I even talk for too long. Still having difficulty getting a full breath in and yawning a lot just to feel like I'm breathing in to full capacity?
I've got a respiratory specialist appointment this Wednesday coming, so hoping for some more info then. But just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience? Just writing it all down into the void because I'm being a huge baby about this and I'm genuinely upset and scared that this won't go away."
"I'm pretty new to this asthma thing. I was diagnosed a couple of month ago after experiencing difficulty breathing and razor blade throat from the cold winter night air. The doctor said I had a textbook case but I haven't been able to get any diagnostic tests done because they have been off limits during covid lockdown in Melbourne AU.

What I am not new to is anxiety, I've recovered from PTSD in the past and take low dose propanol to make me feel safe from panic attacks. Apart from normal human anxiety from pandemic, I'm pretty good in this space.

So when I was diagnosed I was taken off propanol and put on Symbicort, a few nights later I started waking at 2am and staying awake for 3-4 hours with a fluttery heart and the feeling I had to actively breath because my body wouldn't do it through reflex. During this time, if I didn't actively control my breathing I would fly into a panic attack unlike anything I have ever experienced. The first night I went to ED with difficulty breathing, faint, dry mouth, dizziness, tingling in my hands and had convulsions and hand cramps when I was recovering from each attack. They came in waves for the hours long period.

The doctor put me back on propanol and increased my Symbicort dosage. I have continued having disturbed sleep for the last few weeks though I'm able to control the panic attacks so it's just a few hours of breathing and telling myself that a panic attack won't hurt me. I'm becoming a bit fearful around bedtime and no amount of meditation, relaxants, physical exhaustion seems to allow me to sleep through the night.

Last night I joined this sub and read some encouraging anecdotes and think the Symbicort could be a problem for me, despite the doctor brushing it off as anxiety. 

I think I'm just here for validation and support but I'd love to hear of any similar experiences.

Love to you all from forever locked down Melbourne."
"The EKG last night showed left atrial enlargement that I'll have to follow up on with a cardiologist but has anyone has this kind of issue with asthma?
Currently on my second flare up in fifteen days, landed at the ER last night."
"My whole childhood I had free medicaid that gave me the ability to control my asthma well. My background is nothing but drug addicts just trying to get through another impoverished day of life. As soon as I turned 18 the free medicine ride was over. I was on a common Albuterol rescue inhaler and had been using Advair for roughly a year (majority of my life was on flovent). To my dismay these things were incredibly expensive even with insurance which was a laughable prospect to me. My mom dipped out like when I was 12 and my dad is disabled and on SSI with the lowest amount payment so he can't even afford his own life. I live with him who is a cannibis consumer, my brother who is the black sheep and the sense of being sober. My sister and her husband who are both drug addicts (Meth) smoke weed and choke down a pack of menthols a day each. Myself? Im 24 used to smoke cigs up to a half pack a day for a couple years but quit (still so stupid) I'm also a drug addict with a on again off again meth problem. Was pretty ""on"" this past year but have been tapering off. And I also consume cannabis and intend to do so with some apprehension. After I turned 18 I never went back to a primary care physician. Instead I bought Albuterol from sources if I din't have an ER script or something like that. I even traded meth for pulmicort before. Surprisingly that system worked for a few years and I was able to maintain normal employment and do most things. But these past 2 years things have changed for the worse. I fear my meth binges almost always smoking the shit couped with the cigarettes and yes stoners even the weed multiplied by lack of an effective plan have finally caught up. Also the house I share with my family is completely trashed except my room and dads trailer. Mice, roaches, animal excrement, probably mold it's an old house and we got a slum Lord. I know I'm the biggest jackass idiot and I love my family to death regardless but if they won't change I can't live. Advice anybody? I hit the ER every other month the steroid shot helps immensely but wear off later in the month. 10k + medical debt now"

"i‚Äôve had a very sudden onset wet cough for 1 day, started antibiotics as i have bronchiectasis too, now the cough is really dry and all my breathing exercises and inhalers are failing me‚Ä¶ does this mean it‚Äôs getting worse? if so i‚Äôm going to a doctor on monday"
"So probably going through one of the worst asthma flares of my life, and I feel so sad and hopeless. Symbicort was working for a bit, but it stopped working.... Who knows what happened. So now my pulmonologist has referred me to my allergist, and I have an appointment on monday. I'm not sure how the allergist is supposed to help but...

Has anyone here been through any similar stories? Please give me some hope... I'm really hurting right now. My pulmo for the time being said to use inhaled budesonide along with symbicort."
"I was recently diagnosed with asthma, which is triggered by smoking (i got new neighbors who are heavy indoor chain smokers). My doc prescribed me an Advair diskus inhaler, which I've just started using, but it feels like I'm using it wrong. When I release the medicine and breathe in, it feels like most of the powder just gets on my tongue, and I'm not sure if it's actually getting where it needs to be. How can I reduce this? Am I actually using it wrong, or is this a normal thing?"

"Like my asthma has been non existence for 5 years now and 2 days ago or yesterday night literally wouldn't stop coughing all day today I was just coughing clearing my throat and couldn't breath a minute ago for maybe 15 minutes I was breathing weirdly then I noticed I was having a athsma attack I used my blue inhaler maybe 8 times it didn't work I waited really was crying and then I just got better 

How long can a attack last and could I have another one"
"I have an asthma when I was a kid but eventually went away by it‚Äôs own. I didn‚Äôt have any symptoms ever since. I cleaned our garage two days ago and have used disenfectant spray to get rid of dusts off of the surface. Of course there are dust particles floating around and I didn‚Äôt realized I was inhaling it. There were no symptoms until 2 hours later. I was coughing, wheezing and have difficulty breathing. It went away eventually but came back again in the evening. It comes and goes throughout the days and I don‚Äôt know why. It‚Äôs been 2 days and yet I still have the symptoms but no more wheezing this time. I‚Äôm in my early 20‚Äôs and I‚Äôm afraid that my asthma is making its move.  Is this asthma? What do I do, should I call the doctor?"

"Hey everyone hope you‚Äôre breathing easily! (i haven‚Äôt for the past few days unfortunately, but we‚Äôll see how things go!)

Anyways, I wanted to ask a question on here as someone told me something that really got me thinking, (and I don‚Äôt have any friends that have Asthma so i‚Äôm kinda on my own when it comes to the relatability aspect of things.) (i was born prematurely with asthma and its currently causing me some breathing issues which is just a perfect combination with this whether! üò©üò≠)

-

A friend of mine told me that his buddy has asthma but since they smoked a specific type of plant, they didn‚Äôt have any asthma symptoms nor needed to take their inhaler (although they weren‚Äôt using it properly throughout the years he mentioned).

-

I would like to get your thoughts on this as it both confuses me and worries me about this as god knows what side effects could come up later on in their life. 

I also wonder why (non asthmatic) people try to or even force asthmatics to ‚Äútry‚Äù a ‚Äúnew‚Äù (fill-in the blank cream, drink, concoction) as if what ever they are recommending will solve all our problems and they are some how a professional when it comes to our personal battle with our chronic disease. (it triggers the **** outta me omg ahaha üò°)

"I have been diagnosed with Asthma for a few years although I question the diagnosis. I did the pft and the challenge test. I did poorly on the pft and I guess failed the challenge test and they said I have severe asthma. I find this hard to believe. I've never had brochities or any other major lung issue. I just have a daily tight feeling and feels like I can't expand my lungs all the way.  I sometimes almost feel like there's powder or something like that in my lungs and it's almost like I can ""smell"" smoke sometimes. It's not comfortable. The inhalers don't seem to help much. They only other significant thing could be that I'm always trying to clear something out of my throat. It seems like there's like a lump of mucous stuck in there till I can cough/clear it out. I smoked for 15 years and grew up in a family of inconsiderate chain smokers. My new pulmonologist just put me on arnuity and singulair and I really don't notice any improvement from either.  It's been 3 weeks since I started both.  I hate to take meds that aren't working but don't know if I haven't given them enough time. Going back to the doc in a few weeks and hopefully he'll have some advice. Anyone experience anything similar?"

"hi. 
i‚Äôve been diagnosed with bronchiectasis since i was 17, after a bout of pulmonary consolidation in my right lower lung from repeated chest infections. 
last year, in October time i went to hospital because i couldn‚Äôt breathe well, felt unwell in general anyway, stayed for afew days. (it wasn‚Äôt covid, didn‚Äôt have any antibodies for covid either ((before vaccine was out)) so it wasn‚Äôt long covid or something too‚Ä¶. 

at that hospital stay i got diagnosed with asthma, they were talking about it as if i knew that was the case and i just haven‚Äôt been taking my meds‚Ä¶.

"I've been dealing with severe asthma and had been put on daily Prednisone last year to help manage the inflamation, but i've now switched to Nucala injections and starting to make a better recovery.

I've been on 10mg daily for a year and a bit, and now i'm on 5mg/10mg alternating daily for 4 weeks, and then down to 5mg daily, and hopefully down to 0 after that (i think i have an Adrenal test to do too)

"I‚Äôve been diagnosed with post-viral hyperactivity of the bronchi recently and the doc prescribed me Symbicort Turbohaler. Ive been using it for only 9 days now and since yesterday I got hoarse voice. I don‚Äôt recognise my voice anymore, it‚Äôs weird and low. 

This side effect is noted in the instructions, but it doesn‚Äôt say what to do with it. I don‚Äôt want to cancel the Symbicort. I don‚Äôt want to try other IGCS cause all of it has this exact side effect mentioned in the instructions. I can‚Äôt allow myself to throw away money like that, trying every product. I can‚Äôt call my doc because he is on vacation and I don‚Äôt have his number. And I can‚Äôt visit any doctor, I‚Äôm currently not in the city. What should I do? I mean, I fine with just waiting, maybe it will go away, but I want to know if it‚Äôs not dangerous? Won‚Äôt I reach a ‚Äòpoint of no return‚Äô where I could lose my voice forever if I don‚Äôt treat the issue right now? Did you hear anything about it? How dangerous is it? 

I also don‚Äôt understand one thing: side effects also suggest fungal infection (candidiasis), which is why I was told to rinse my throat with water after every use of the inhaler, so I did. But I only gargle water for a second, didn‚Äôt try hard. What if this is the reason I still got candidiasis and this is the reason of my hoarseness? Or can hoarse voice be without it too, for the other reason? 
I know I could just check my mouth to see if there are white patches on my tongue and back of the throat, but unfortunately I‚Äôve been having this white cast all over my mouth cavity for a year, the doctors said they don‚Äôt know what is it, so now I literally can‚Äôt discern my old white thing from a possible candidiasis :/ Is it OK if I just wait for a while?

"Hi there. So, after I‚Äôve been coughing since December (mornings and evenings), and the GP thinking I had some acid reflux problem and then thinking it was a bronchitis that wasn‚Äôt healed up very well, I got finally diagnosed with allergic asthma (dust mites). I had some junik inhaler from when she thought it was bronchitis but now I‚Äôve been prescribed the pink foster/fostair inhaler. I‚Äôm supposed to use it daily, mornings and evenings. Since I started about a week ago, my coughing attacks in the mornings and evenings have stopped but I now cough more (softer coughs) in the day time and my chest feels tight and my throat sore. Is this a common side effect? Should I stick it out? Or go to my doc and ask for a different one? Also, i only have that inhaler which I read is a combination treatment, while most people seem to have a controller and a reliever. Should I ask for a reliever?

Used to be a smoker but quit a short time before corona hit. Also, am I now more at risk to catch it? I have received both shots but I‚Äôm not sure if asthma is still considered a risky condition. Coughing seems to be triggered by all kinds of smoke and physical exhaustion. And the dust mites."
"It seems like I can only hold mine ‚Äúcomfortably‚Äù for 10 seconds, 20 maximum."
"Hi there!

I hope this question is okay, please let me know if there's a better place to ask this. 

My son is eight and we're fairly confident he's suffering from a mild form of asthma. Basically he takes a very long time to recover from any respiratory illness (long periods of deep coughing that keep him up at night and can even induce vomiting) and he experiences pain when running or engaging in physical activities. Otherwise, he's a very healthy kid. 

This is something we've watched since he was about four or five but wasn't something his pediatrician wanted to test for until we saw a real need (ie. he became active in sports and was feeling discomfort or was still having trouble recovering from illness as he got older, etc.). Well, as I said, he's now eight and he's been active in soccer for the last couple years and the chest pains aren't going away. He's also still having trouble recovering from illness. 

His pediatrician isn't not avoiding testing, we just can't get in. 

See, when the pandemic hit, obviously everything shut down. And then, in August of 2020 his main pediatrician at the office was unfortunately diagnosed with breast cancer and had to take a leave of absence to undergo treatment. This caused all of her patients (probably over 100 if not more) to need to be squeezed into other doctors schedules. At the time there were four left at the office. Then, shortly after that, a doctor left the office to ""better serve the community as a whole,"" which we all felt was a real shitty move given the current state of the office. That, of course, displaced even more patients. **And then** we lost another freaking doctor who simply just wanted to move downstate to be closer to family. 

Like. People. Could you stop!? Within a matter of about six months our once robust pediatric office was down to two pediatricians who were barely keeping up with well checks, not to mention all the sick kids they were dealing with. 

We had my sons asthma testing scheduled for early this year, but then he got a cold so we had to reschedule. Then when the rescheduled appointment finally came up (three months later) myself and my youngest son got sick and we were experiencing COVID symptoms (my husband and are vaccinated) so we had to cancel the appointment pending test results (which were negative thankfully) and because of the remote area we live in those took a whole freaking week. 

We never rescheduled the appointment because the office ladies were literally like, ""Honestly, just pick a day and call at like 8AM and we'll get you in for a sick visit."" Well... see... That doesn't really work for me because I work from home and I'm freelance so it's really hard for me to just say, ""Well, let's roll the dice and see what's going to happen today."" I have clients and things scheduled that need to get done. 

**So, all that to say: Who else can I take my freaking child to, to get an asthma test?** 

He just started the Fall season of soccer and he's complaining that his chest hurts and he's worried about playing in games and I can't freaking blame him. While the pediatricians office finally got two new doctors and his OG doctor is back (so grateful she's healthy and doing well and we'll see her soon), we still can't get him in until November for an asthma test. Is it okay for me to take him to my doctor? Or just some random allergist? I feel like I'm cheating on the pediatricians if I do that but I also want my kid to get tested for this so he can get an inhaler and feel better and run around like all the other kids and not be in pain."
"Feel like I have a mild tight chest and coughing a bit should I take my inhaler?

"I live in a very humid place (50-90% year round) and I recently stopped being able to afford my daily inhaled steroid that was helping so much.

"Has anyone experienced a stiff, tight restriction of their diaphragm with Albuterol??? Almost like a micro paralysis.

Background: I‚Äôve had an adverse reaction to Albuterol, I‚Äôve taken it on 5 occasions and 3 of them were positive, one was neutral and one was VERY negative. The negative experience was when I used it feeling chest tightness come on and hadn‚Äôt yet felt bronchoconstriction, I realize now I was having a mild panic attack when I took it because I had just helped my grandma call an ambulance to take her to the hospital, oh boy was that a trip! After taking my puffs I started breathing really fast and had tremors and heart palps and then it felt like my diaphragm just froze and my lungs were all open so I could inhale but my diaphragm could barely move to exhale. It lasted for several hours and then I was fine. I drove to the ER and sat outside keeping myself as calm as I could knowing I didn‚Äôt want an unnecessary ER visit in a ‚Äúpanasonic‚Äù for obvious reasons but also very out of sorts with my breathing and wanting to be nearby just in case. I was fine after four hours but very shaken up. It took me a year to try Albuterol again. Yesterday I tried it again and had a neutral experience, I was having bronchoconstriction and I had no emotional disturbance so I felt it was worth a go and it had been enough time that I was willing to give it another chance. When I inhaled (only did one puff) I got racing heart and I didn‚Äôt get palpitations but for the next several hours I had higher heart rate. The bronchodilator didn‚Äôt work at first but after 30mins I felt opening in bronchioles but then shortly also a setting in of a stiff, tight restriction of my diaphragm. This is twice now. Has anyone experienced this or know what I‚Äôm talking about??? For me this is whack a mole because it‚Äôs just as uncomfortable and hard to breathe when my diaphragm feels frozen, thankfully it wasn‚Äôt to the extent as before. After two hours I felt my diaphragm uncoil and stiffness leave. The other symptoms I experienced were muscle twitches and also a horrible smelling stool shortly after taking Albuterol like from bad adrenaline. For me Albuterol is for when all else fails and I need airways to open. Albuterol hasn‚Äôt relieved my symptoms in a worthwhile way without creating new ones."

"I‚Äôm not really sure why I‚Äôm posting here ‚Ä¶ perhaps just for peace of mind or to feel less alone. But here is what I‚Äôm going through. 

For the past 6ish month, something had been wrong with my lungs. Shortness of breath that is getting worse and worse. Burning pain in my lungs (at the start it was just occasional, then every morning, then almost constant). I also have chest pain (originally like an elephant was on my chest and now it‚Äôs a burning feeling ‚Äî different from burning in my lungs, more like a soreness across my entire chest). 

I‚Äôve seen my GP and had tests done. I was told I have mild restricted lung and high FeNO (146 ppb). Ventolin inhaler does nothing but make me jumpy. (This was confirmed in the testing‚Äî the inhaler had no impact on my test.)

I‚Äôve been on Breo Ellipta since 24 August. For the first 9 days I was on the 100/25 dose and it did nothing. Then my doctor had me try 200/25 and for the first time in ages the burning pain went away. I still feel tight/pressure and have shortness of breath. 

But after a few days on 200/25, I started having bad pain/tingling in my hands, arms and legs. It got so bad I couldn‚Äôt hold a pen. 
My doctor sent me for a brain MRI‚Äîluckily clear but we now think it‚Äôs the Breo. 

My doctor put me back on the 100/25 and within days, the pain in my lungs came back and it feels worse than ever. (My limb pain went away.) So now I am back on 200/25 and my GP is monitoring me. Lungs are better but arms are started to tingle again üò£

I should add that I have severe dust allergies. I have seen an allergy specialist (I‚Äôve been wanting to do the desensitisation for years but was always pregnant or breastfeeding). Allergy doctor won‚Äôt do anything until my breathing is under control. 

The thing that makes me nervous is I still haven‚Äôt seen a respiratory specialist. (I am in Australia and going through the public system. I‚Äôve been on the waitlist for months now.) I have no diagnosis and my GP is doing the best she can ‚Äî but I am now having so much health anxiety. Do I have asthma? Are my lungs getting damaged while I wait for treatment? Will I feel like this forever? Has anyone been through this? I have no wheezing and I‚Äôve never had an asthma attack. But when I‚Äôm not on the 200 Breo the pain is pretty bad. And even with the Breo, my shortness of breath is bad. Oxygen levels always ok though. 

(Also I‚Äôve been tested for COVID multiple times, always negative and there is almost no active cases where I live. I‚Äôve also had pneumonia twice in past 3 years.)"

"Hey guys I'm really suffering here and I'm hoping someone can give me a little hope because I'm just miserable. I had asthma when I was a kid and it was well controlled on Advair and at some point I just stopped using my inhaler and never needed it again. Fast forward to March and I'm 29 years old and all the sudden I've got this unproductive cough that won't go away and I'm having these attacks when I take a shower. They thought it was COVID but I got tested and it wasn't. Then they kept giving me a bunch of different allergy medications and those didn't help and then all the sudden the light bulb went off that it might be my asthma flaring up. So they gave me an albuterol inhaler and that doesn't help. Then they try Flovent and that made my cough like 50% better. So my primary care doctor orders a pulmonary function test before he decides to send me to a pulmonologist. So I get that done and it shows that, sure enough, I'm having breathing problems. But the weird thing is that an Albuterol breathing treatment didn't make a difference. 

So I got an appointment to see a pulmonologist but it's a month and a half out so he just starts prescribing me different inhalers and I've been in inhaler hell ever since. I have tried Advair, Breo, and Symbicort and I just keep getting worse. I can't even move without my cough getting worse. I've thrown up twice during coughing fits and I routinely have to take 20 minute breaks just to rest and recover from these attacks. I'm hoping the pulmonologist can help but unfortunately my experience in my area, and the experience of a lot of people I know, is that doctors in my little slice of nowhere don't know how to deal with complex cases and I've always been a complex case with all of my health problems. So I'm hoping to get some advice about what I should ask the pulmonologist or look for or any thoughts about what the hell is going on with me because this asthma is taking over my life."
"ANyone experienced that ? Recently came around the fact that I had asthma (especially in the summer with humidity). I got some pump that I have to use twice per day, inhaled twice in the morning and twice at night. 

Gives me the jitters and make my heart beat faster, like it was ephedrine or something, and it lasts for a while.

:/"
" Yesterday  I was being too breathless cause of asthma that's why I use this  breathe machine It really help me relief pain caused by this crisis and  It get me back to my normal body breathing that's why I want to ask if I  can use it twice a dayü§îü§î

I've been using Symbicort for some time and I've noticed that it is basically like taking Albuterol all the time but longer lasting. I also get headaches and a faster heartbeat from it as well so the side effects are similar. Obviously it helps to have an ICS in it for preventive purposes. If using Albuterol daily is a bad idea then isn't this the same case for LABA's as well?
I feel like I‚Äôm in a constant cycle. I lose weight and then I have an asthma flare and I get on these steroids and gain weight again. Anyone have success of losing weight on steroids or any asthma meds? I need hope
"Do you feel normal in between attacks?  I‚Äôve always understood asthma to come in attacks, but have completely normal breathing in between.  Is that true or a misconception?"
It gives me so much energy. Thank you Symbicort. Thank you so so so so so so much.
"I don't have severe asthma and trouble in breathing but i get tired easily. 

What's your opinion? And what sort of exercises I should do and avoid in gym?"
"Hey there, I'm a 27 yo male, about 110kg/240lb, and 187cm/6'1"". I take a Foster 100/6 and Salbutamol when needed. (I don't need it a lot, but mostly when I sneeze, which triggers my asthma, the I use the blue spray).

I'll try to sum up,

Something happened about two years ago, I started feeling I wasn't able to take a full breath. I thought I had covid at the time (even tho I dont leave the house nor have friends coming by or visit anybody). My oxygen levels were fine (about 97/98% when it was measured). I thought it was the spring allergy, which happened to me once and I had to take cortisone pills for it. I did take the pills but didn't help. Went to the pulmonologist and did all the tests and told me that my asthma was fine, and that I don't even have a severe asthma. He said what I'm having was ""Vocal cord dysfunction"" and sent me to a therapist for that. Where I did breath therapy and stuff. But didn't really help me.

Now to my experience and what I think it affects this chest tightness to trigger, it's where you feel that you need to take a deep breath but you can't, and you keep trying multiple times till you manage to have one then the same thing comes back again, ((whenever this happens I feel like yawning, perhaps on purpose, and whenever I yawn I manage to take this full breath)). I feel this problem is caused by my body. I'm not that of a sporty guy and used to sit during the first major covid quarantine at the house being lazy. For example whenever I lay on my stomach/my chest this tightness gets triggered, and then I stand up and still have this tightness for about 20 mins. Even if I bow forward or like while sitting and bow forward to rest my head on the desk I get this tightness immediately and need to straighten myself up, I feel I just have a ""spongy"" body, if that's the word for it if you know what I mean.. and none of the sprays helped me. It's been like 2 years and it still happens, sometimes I'm normal sometimes it comes to me.

Just wondering if anybody been through such experience."
Can somebody send me a picture of their smart inhaler if you have one?

"Here is the insight into this post in case you missed it:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/pgrjxo/how\_does\_it\_feel\_to\_know\_that\_you\_are\_darwinian/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/pgrjxo/how_does_it_feel_to_know_that_you_are_darwinian/)

You know a bit of time ago, I posted feeling bad I was a darwinian failure. But, I am so happy now. Symbicort is really getting asthma surpressed so well, and I look at my genetics, and they are by no means a failure. I just have a tiny flaw in my breathing genes, which is easily fixable by medical science, and thus is why these genes kept being passed on!

Every other genes, other than my skin genes (eczema) work perfectly! I have a few food allergies too, but nothing serious. I look at all the diseases people have on subs like this one and r/ChronicIllness and it makes me grateful. Every single one my genes functions correctly and propels me towards success other than my lung and skin genes. Even my metabolism genes! I'm thankful, I don't gain weight easily. Skinny genes rock!

I am NOT a darwinian failure. I am a huge ass success. There's a bunch of people that would kill to trade spots with me, and I am so grateful."
"Hello all, new to this subreddit. So for background, my four year old had to go to the ER in December because she was struggling to breathe and wheezing. They gave her a breathing treatment and an inhaler just in case, and I‚Äôve only had to give it to her a handful of times since then. Yesterday, she woke up with a constant cough, it didn‚Äôt stop and she had really labored breathing. So, I gave her her inhaler, the first round didn‚Äôt do anything, and neither did her second round. So I took her in to the ER, they gave her two one hour long breathing treatments and steroids for inflammation and sent us on our way. Today she is still wheezing (just a little, not very much) and coughing here and there and her inhaler is once again, not helping her at all. Is it normal to get that many breathing treatments and medication and still have issues the following days? I‚Äôm very new to this and very lost since myself and my husband do not have asthma. Any insight would be appreciated."
"I‚Äôve had asthma as a child, but recently my asthma had started to come back. My Dr. prescribed me Albutrol and I‚Äôve had to go to the urgent care before due to not being able to breath. I‚Äôve been having to use the Albutrol 3-5 times a week. No idea why it came back, and I live in Hawaii where the air is very clean, so I know it‚Äôs not pollution.

I went for a run today and I am not normally a runner, but I am an active person, I go hiking 2 times a week, kayak, yoga, I do kettlebell and body weight exercises, as well as rowing 4-5 times a week for 30 min each day. For some reason my lungs started burning and it made me panic a little. I could only run for 2 min at a time before feeling like my lungs were completely exhausted of air. 

It is especially bad at night when I go to bed and feels like there is a brick on my chest preventing me from taking a deep breath in, and if I try to inhale deeply I end up coughing. 

Do you think Albutrol is the right thing to be taking? I don‚Äôt want to stop my exercise routine because it helps with my depression."

how di i be diangonesed with Asthma? becauuse im starting to  feel worried now
"Is this just asthma? I'm just constantly out of breath. Even sitting here doing nothing. I don't feel like I have that bad of a wheeze going on. Going up the stairs I need like 5 min to recover and get my breath back after. I have coughing fits but still no wheeze. I have an Albuterol inhaler, nebulizer, and advair taken daily. I'm just confused because usually I can hear a wheeze when I breathe when I have symptoms like this. Also it's usually helped by Albuterol and this doesn't seem to improve with it."

"Im really angry about myself after booking an airbnb room which was dusty as hell, got a flare up and also lost a lot of money. I know its my own fault believing that I can book an airbnb flat as asthmatic, but I didnt expect it will be that bad. My asthma was well controlled since more than a year. Not a single cough. I directly saw the room is pretty dusty and the flat as a whole, but I thought I can stand it. I was so wrong. After the first night I started coughing, but also thought I hate to book a hotel at the same time and loose a lot of money, since I already paid the airbnb. It got worse and worse for me, I was not only coughing more and more and got breathing problems at night, my lungs even started hurting by just breathing. Such an awful feeling. I was even getting afraid maybe I cant get rid of it during my holidays. After trying to wash the bedsheets and saw how aweful the matress looked like (it must have been ten, twenty or even more years old by the way it looked like) I moved into a clean hotel. Its awesome how I started feeling how my lungs started to recover after 24 hours. This morning I rarely cough now and everything feels much better. Im writing this to vent and also as a warning for other asthmatic people that going to an airbnb can be a huge problem for us and its better to think twice before going into one."
"I finally moved out of my parents‚Äô home and drank alcohol and smoked (with a juul) for the first time to celebrate being done with finals which I am not very proud of and ended up cross faded about 24 hours ago. I did this with like two other friends in my apartment. Now I‚Äôm developing a cough and I‚Äôm pretty sure the alcohol triggered it (I has tequila, champagne, wine, and soju) plus smoking at the same time. I took my medications but forgot my spacer at home. Does this happen to anyone else :( I feel so stupid ahhhh I made very poor decisions"
The aluminum trays for my Breo seem pretty sturdy and like they *should* be useful. But I can't figure out what for. Anyone figured out any uses for them?
"So I got a mild case after a few weeks of breo ellipta, prescribed by my GP. Then I saw my new asthma and allergy doc. She diagnosed thrush, gave me Nystatin swish and swallow. Also moved me to dulera and a spacer.

I diligently brush after the breo and now the dulera. After 7 days of the Nystatin it looked gone, so I stopped as directed. A few days later I noticed it back again. It looks worse now then it has.

Basically this feels like a huge never ending battle. Any advice? I'm newly diagnosed with asthma and already struggling with so much."
"Today has been the worst day. I was prescribed Albuterol by an urgent care doctor. She told she saw my lungs are perfectly healthy but chest cavity is a little constricted so she said that Albuterol might get some air if I ever had a mild asthma attack. I used that first canister a couple of times and there was not any problem. I lost it and got a replacement from another urgent care doctor a couple of days ago. I used this new canister early in the morning and right of the bat, I started feeling anxious. I kept coughing as when I feel I have asthmatic symptoms dude to acid reflux. I went to go get gas and anxiety building. It felt I drank way too much coffee and I was sweating pretty noticeably. And hour or so had passed since I used the inhaler (1 puff) and all of a sudden my body went numb, heavy, my heart started racing and my chest+stomach felt like it was caving in. My left arm started hurting and it felt like I was about to have a heart attack. It was the worst feeling I‚Äôve ever had. I had to call 911. Firefighters/paramedics met me in a public parking lot and checked me out. They told me that I was okay and they didn‚Äôt need to take me on an ambulance. I suffer from anxiety phases but that was an entire different beast. This was one of the scariest moments of my life. 

I wanted to come on here, share, and maybe discuss cause I haven‚Äôt found anyone who‚Äôs had similar experience. 

I really thought I was going to die. 

Never again."
"So I‚Äôm experiencing a lot of headaches. More so now than ever before. 

I have asthma and my attacks are slow and steady. It‚Äôs less of a surprise attack and more of a calculated and well executed plan. Basically, I‚Äôll randomly realize that my breathing is labored and I‚Äôm really working to get air in. No real trigger. It‚Äôs just like that

Anyway, I‚Äôve been suffering with these headaches all towards the front of my face and head. Doc says my sinuses look fine but that if decongestants don‚Äôt work, go to an ENT. (Haven‚Äôt been yet) 

Others who suffered from this type of headache have suggested taking migraine medication because it‚Äôs worked for them. Further investigation says some migraines can feel like sinus infections but are not. 

My mom has a theory my headaches have spawned from overusing albuterol. I take a puff practically every night. Some may call it my crutch. But she thinks my nightly symptoms are either caused by the repeated use of the inhaler at night or because I‚Äôm *thinking* I need it. Either way, she could be right 

Now, I have heard of the inhaler causing shakiness and headaches, but usually right after use, or at least I thought. 

Have you all heard or experienced anything like this using your inhalers?"


"Because I used to have it bad when I was younger, and it's gotten better in recent years. But to manage it, I generally walk at a slower pace, which pisses off my stepdad in ways that I can't even describe.

I tried to explain it to him, but then again, he's an idiot."
"NIGHTMARE!

Very unpleasant trip to hospital earlier this week, and so disappointed as well as I completely didn't see it coming unlike my previous asthma attack a few months ago. 

I was put onto Soprabec steroids (2 puffs morning, 2 evening) in June after having an asthma attack at work (I was fired pretty much immediately after that) and have had both Pfizer jabs. My first jab was alright, the second I was monstrously ill for about 4 days and my steroid doses started to make me feel a bit nauseous after my evening dose, however I have never thrown up from it. I booked an appointment with my regular GP (I'm a uni student so was at home and home GP is not very nice), which is on Tuesday (earliest one I could get!), and told her when I booked that it was making me feel sick, hungry and exhausted all the time, she suggested we'd change it at the appointment. Recently I went back to uni and started my new job as ""Welcome Rep"", helping the new students settle. I'm very happy in my new job, my supervisors are lovely, helpful and understanding. Monday was training (mainly icebreakers and ideas whilst stood in a circle) and packing tonnes of welcome bags - hard work, but was fine. No wheezing, a bit of a sore chest and back but I had been bending/turning a lot and those boxes were huge, it was also 30 degrees C (aka HOT!). Tuesday the same (about 28 degrees, still HOT!). Wednesday I helped a single disabled student move in but it was surprisingly lightweight and calm with no stairs and the only ""heavy"" things were on wheels. Then came Thursday.

Went to uni rather late in the day (2pm) and helped perhaps 3 students in total - only one had a heavy suitcase, and even then it was just bringing it up 2 steps and wheeling it into her room. The rest were easy-pesy. Headed home then out to the SU bar with 3 Freshers and a good friend - a few older students then joined us as well. I was feeling good! A bit tired, but isn't everyone after work? Didn't cough during the day, didn't wheeze, didn't feel like I needed my reliever at all - practically symptom free all day. My FitBit alarm went off saying ""hey, 8pm, steroid time"" so took my steroids as directed and as normal before sitting down to pizza and a game of Cards Against Humanity with the others. Within a few bites of the pizza I started to feel physically sick, so headed outside for fresh air (no cigarette smoke, nobody was outside). Then I started coughing, so used my reliever as I normally would, but it wouldn't stop. 4 maybe 5 puffs in, I stop coughing, but had panicked my friend and the group as I was wheezing \*bad\* and all the colour had gone from my face. She took me to hospital (literally right next door to the uni) where it got worse. My triggers were also magnified, even the smell of cigarettes wafting through the automatic door were making my wheezing and coughing worse when usually to wheeze/cough I have to be right up close. My heart rate was consistently between 120-130 even when sitting - they re-did my pulse twice in triage, had to put my hand flat against the table to stop shaking. I had another 3 puffs or so in triage/waiting and I was freezing, super pale and tired.

The nurses and the doctor were all so kind and listened to me and were great at trying to calm me down, normally I've had doctors who dismiss me straight away but they took me seriously, read all my medicines, listened to my friend tell them what happened and double checked my notes. They said it was the right thing to come to hospital as it could've gotten worse. They gave me the nebuliser which really helped, my wheezing went away loads after a round of it (the doctor agreed I sounded a lot better after) but it did make me all trembly for a bit. It also stopped me feeling like I was going to chuck up. Eventually my heart rate settled all the way back down to about 84 on my Fitbit which is much more normal when I'm sat down. They've given me steroid tablets for a week which have made the world a bit funny, like it's being tilted on its side and I'm uneasy on my feet, but they did let me go to work as I'm sat down answering questions instead of moving boxes/running around and I have crutches to help me steady myself when I'm walking around, its very low effort work. I'm just so so confused as to why the steroids I had been taking since June had suddenly made me so horribly ill when none of my asthma triggers were present, I'd felt good during the day and I was happy. The pizza tasted great, the orange juice I had was great. The last asthma attack I'd had in June, I'd been feeling off for a couple of days beforehand and wasn't on preventer medicines, hence I was so confused and upset as to why I was suddenly feeling so sick so soon after my normal, regular medicines and hadn't had any colds, coughs or new prescription changes since my 2nd Pfizer dose about a month ago.

Has anyone else had their bodies change to medicine reactions like this? After Pfizer second doses or even at all? I'm at a loss and none of the emergency department doctors had any ideas either (blood work was clear, ECG clear just a bit fast but to be expected after 7 puffs of Salamol and a minor panic)"
Just curious. I‚Äôve been taking edibles instead of smoking but I‚Äôve heard it helps some people with asthma so I‚Äôm just wondering
"Even the steam from shower water and the hot air of a blowdryer cause me asthma attacks. I hate this shit so much,  I wish I could live a normal life but no, my respiratory system is not suited for existing."
"Looking elsewhere on Reddit I saw someone mention the cost of their asthma inhaler was $300. Curious as to what this drug was I realised that it could be almost any medication. 

I live in the UK and use Fostair, Montelukast, and Fexofenedine. Each prescription would cost about ¬£10 but there's a government scheme where I pay ¬£120 a year for all prescriptions. 

The price difference is stark and terrifying. It's sometimes hard to know how good things are for you but this has really made me grateful for the NHS."
"My 2 year old baby girl was diagnosed with asthma after an attack and I have asthma and my husband and I were thinking of moving in order ease our asthma triggers.

I was born in Puerto Rico, which is a beautiful place but can be hard for asthmatics. I lived in Florida for a short while (as not fun for my asthma) and currently my hubby and I and our baby girl live in Long Island, NY which we love but also effects our breathing. We were thinking of moving somewhere dry like New Mexico or Nevada.

Has anyone here ever moved due to their condition? If so where and how do you feel now since moving?"
"Hi all. I'm new to the group, and am grateful for any feedback. I'm in my early 40s (female). Here in N. CA we had heavy wildfire smoke for a solid month. One day towards the end of that month, I developed heart palpitations that would continue for minutes at a time while I wasn't doing anything strenuous. I had been noticing a dry cough, hoarse voice and headaches from the smoke. After several days of ongoing palpitations, I went to the ER and was diagnosed with PVCs (non-dangerous palpitations) and an elevated heart rate (around 100-120bpm). A cardiologist said the same thing. At this point, the air has cleared, but I still have palpitations all through the day, and a feeling of tightness when I breathe (my oxygen saturation is still very good, though). My GP thought it could be asthma, so she prescribed Advair and albuterol inhalers. I'm nervous to take them them because I know they can make heart issues worse, but I'm wondering if calming the breathing issues might also calm my heart. 

Has anyone else had ongoing heart palpitations with uncontrolled asthma? 

If you did, did the albuterol make the palpitations worse, or did treatment help to calm the palpitations and the asthma simultaneously?

I'm feeling very worried about the continuous heart palpitations. Thank you for any feedback."
"I‚Äôve been struggling with my breathing for years now but I feel like my asthma (if it even is that) has never been properly diagnosed or treated. I never feel like I can take a full breath and when I try to force an exhale and expel air from my lungs, nothing comes out and I wheeze. I‚Äôve had a tightness in the middle of my chest when I take a deep breath and I went to the ER the other night. I feel like because I told them I have asthma, they just dismissed me. They said my lungs sounded clear and then gave me a treatment and 60mg of prednisone. The chest pain has not gone away and I just want to cry because I feel like the lack of oxygen I get is making my body hurt and making me tired. I get so out of breath from anything and this just sucks. 
I‚Äôm not asking for medical advice, I just want to rant )):"
Can a chest infection such as acute bronchitis affect fev1/fvc and fev1? Even if I got my pft test 9 days into my chest infection it could still affect results correct?
"Hey y'all, I could use some advice, I don't know what to do. 

I'm 21 years old, I've struggled with asthma as long as I can pretty much remember. I take singulaire daily as prescribed and I have a rescue inhaler, but since Monday I've had to take it at least once or twice a day. It hurts to breathe and my bronchial tubes feel like they're on fire and I get winded just talking or standing up or walking. I have a cough that's dry sometimes and productive other times. 

The last time I went to urgent care, they were pretty dismissive because my lungs sounded clear and they couldn't hear anything, and they kinda wrote it off as a panic attack, but they stuck me on a nebulizer anyway. I reached out to my asthma doctor but obviously it's the weekend and it's just been getting worse by the day and I know I should go to urgent care probably, but the thought of having them be so dismissive again makes me want to cry. My boss has also been pretty dismissive and has implied I'm faking it, and it's been interfering with me going to class because I can't walk from my car to a building without getting so winded I can't talk or breathe. 

Should I suck it up and go to urgent care tomorrow morning or should I wait until Monday to talk to my doctor? I really don't know what's going on because it hurts to breathe so bad and I keep getting winded, but the urgent care people are very dismissive about it and it's kinda terrifying."

"I am looking for a little advice and peace of mind. For the last couple of weeks, I've been experiencing periods of what seem like asthma attacks. I have never been diagnosed, but I have a PFT scheduled for next week. My sister tells me that, unbeknownst to me, she has been dealing with asthma the last ten years or so, and has been on Symbicort for some time, so I guess I have a familial history of the condition. 

My symptoms are as follows: shortness of breath that gets progressively worse, usually over the course of half an hour to an hour. Typically coincides with mid-afternoon and later evening. While most of the time episodes come on while just sitting at my desk in my home office, a couple came on quicker when I went to walk the dog the other night and this morning when I stepped outside (it was the first cold morning of the year). 

This has happened once before, last year around the that initial period of COVID panic (March-April 2020). At the time, I didn't really think much of the periods of slight shortness of breath; I didn't really have other symptoms of COVID, so I didn't think too much of it. Then one day it get especially pronounced and I went to urgent care and then on to the ER. They gave me an albuterol inhaler to use if I needed it, but since I didn't have pneumonia they sent me home. Negative test came back a couple days later, so I didn't think much of it. I did have a stronger cough thereafter and remember feeling quite tired for the next couple of days.

Basically it's been the same thing this time around, except the episodes are a bit stronger and seemingly more consistent. Once I realized that the symptoms were the same as last time, I have been using my inhaler (which I had used only once between the initial prescription and this recent period). The worst symptoms improve pretty immediately (10 minutes), with the ""shaky breath"" feeling wearing off after about 45 minutes. I've had to use an inhaler at least once a day -- and as many as 3 times a day, between 4 and 6 hours apart -- for 8 of the last 9 days.

Anyway, I guess I'm worried about how to handle the immediate future prior to my PFT. Is my current course of action sustainable until I get my PFT? Is there any health consequence to using the albuterol that often for the near term? I'm also looking for any advice on how to improve the fatigue. These last couple of weeks have absolutely destroyed my energy. Even when I can breath following albuterol, I feel wiped up and I don't want to talk because it makes me tired. If I work (remote desk job), I can't really talk in meetings because it tires me too much. And on most days, I've only been able to work for a half day or so, because I just feel so tired after an episode. Is there anything that's worked to help people with this (apart from simply resting on the couch)? 

Other weird things I've noticed: the feeling of a tremor in my lungs after administering albuterol, 

Anyway, any thoughts or advice on how I can manage the near-term until I can speak to a pulmonologist would be really appreciated. I've never had anything like this before and I'm both scared and worried that I'm not going to know when I need to seek emergency care. Even if you don't have advice, I appreciate you reading. Simply being able to talk to someone who may know something about what I'm experiencing is a big weight off my chest (metaphorically speaking, at least)."
"My 2 year old baby girl was hospitalized today. She was walking around and fell hard to the ground and was coughing and was frantically gasping for air. My husband and I rushed her to the ER praying that it was not Covid-related. It turns out she had an asthma attack (thankful it's not Covid but asthma is something not to take likely - I have asthma).

My daughter is the 4th person in my family, that I know, who has asthma. The others are myself, my sister and my mother - all women. And I got me thinking; is asthma passed through women?

I am Puerto Rican, and Puerto Ricans are unfortunately prone to asthma and other respiratory issues due to the humidity, climate, water, atmosphere, etc. My mother told that her asthma was bad when she was younger but got better with it with age, my sister had a mild asthma when she was in her teens and never had an issues with it - I, on the other hand, had a horrible asthma and still suffer form it. My asthma was frequently triggered in the spring, fall and winter (even to this day those are rough seasons for me), I was hospitalized as a child, I carried my inhaler / nebulizer during my childhood in case I had an attack and that was pretty much the case until my early 20s. However, my asthma returned and really hit me hard when I was pregnant and I took meds and used oxygen for 9 months (however wearing a mask due to the pandemic did help my condition). Now my daughter has asthma.

As I said, I'm Puerto Rican and we are prone to asthma but my daughter is only half PR (my husband's Polish (and doesn't have asthma or any breathing problems)) but as my little girl is sleeping next to me and has her little nebulizer nearby after a rough morning I am curious; is asthma common through women when it comes to genetics?

Thank and be well everyone!"
"Can somebody please tell me, why did my asthma come back after years? I had it when I was 8 and since i got hospitalized i never felt the struggle again. Now im 15, it suddenly came back and it is horrible. I am asking here on reddit since google can't give me answers and i can't go to hospital either because of COVID. Can barely breathe while typing this lol. Please explain it to me it would really mean a lot. Thankyou!"

"How do i stop wheezing? It‚Äôs been three days, i don‚Äôt know the trigger of my asthma attack but i assume it was allergies. I can‚Äôt get any sleep bc i keep hearing myself wheeze and it is annoying. Does anyone have any tips that they do to reduce inflammation/wheezing?"

"Any nighttime sufferers have any tips?  


This year has been awful, I haven't been  able to get a consistent nights sleep in forever and it's starting to bite me. Going to bed and waking up an hour later with tight chest, having to get up and go do something for 2+ hours while symptoms abate before I can sleep again."
"Just looking for suggestions on a good way to generally clean my bathroom and stuff.

"Today, I just wanted to express my grattitude for the fact that I don't have exercise induced asthma. I didn't even know that was a thing when I was a kid. I couldn't imagine carrying a ventolin everywhere and not being able to do spontaneous unplanned exercise My heart goes out to my brothers and sisters affected by EIA  üò≠."

"(Using reddit on the phone for the first time, no idea what these buttons mean !) 

After several months of lockdown I have travelled to the north of England, and noticed my asthma peaked when I woke, in the afternoon, and when I sleep. And it‚Äôs been this way for about three weeks now. I moved back south and still persists. Laughing triggers it instantly, same with alcohol. Anyone else had this before? Thanks."
"I have been on Singulair for about 20 years (from about the time I was about 10 years old). I started it back in the late 90's/early 2000's when it was first released, and the only side effect anyone worried about was headaches. Which, I did suffer from for the first few months. 

I have struggled with my mental health for most of my life. Most of the things I have experience also happen to be listed on the boxed warning for Singulair. Although I have been through my fair share of trauma, I also wonder if being on Singulair for most of my life has played any part in this.

I am also on Xolair every 2 weeks and allergy shots. I am meeting with my allergist next week to see if stopping Singulair would be a safe thing to try. I have had a gap in my prescription before and went without it for a few days, and, while my asthma was fine, I felt like hell. Body aches, headache, stomach cramps, anxiety....Things I never expected from an asthma med...

What experience have you all had with this drug?"
"I have severe asthma, allergies, and reoccurring nasal polyps. My doctor recommended Duxipent back in late July. I just now received it thanks to insurance hoops and injected it yesterday.

I'm pretty sure I'm allergic to it. My toungue swelled up and found it difficult to breathe. I used my epipen and was okay. I was scared to go to the emergency room because of how bad Covid is here, ER visits take really long to be seen. 

I was wondering if anyone else has had this reaction with duxipent and if their doctor had any other alternatives. I'm on several inhalers and daily allergy medicine. I used to take breathing treatments 3 times a day."
"I'm just wondering if there's anyone her with severe asthma (I'm on trelegy, allergy medicine and have been on prednisone on and off the last year - next step is biologic) who also had covid. Did you need to go to the hospital? Did you need oxygen or ICU time?"

"Had covid 3 months ago which gave me asthma (1 month of Fostair 4x a day and still not back to normal yet), and quite worried about catching it again. Unfortunately I have two flatmates and we‚Äôre all students doing in person classes‚Ä¶so bit of an unfortunate situation. Just wanted to see for those who were double vaxxed and still got covid, what did that do to your asthma?"
"I'm in the US and my insurance is provided by my employer. I've got two young children and work two jobs, so finding time to visit my lung specialist is difficult. He prescribes me a three month supply of Breo 100/25 but wants me to visit after every 6 months. I'm 34, been taking Breo a long time. It works fine. My asthma isn't complicated by anything. I could workout, run, do whatever. It frustrates me that I have to take two hours out of my day for him to look at me for five minutes, say I'm gtg and continue the prescription. I know in the context of a year, this isn't that much time. As I'm writing this, I'm already coming to some conclusions about what I know I should do. 

Are there any online doctors (not asking for anything illegal) that are on a reliable website that won't cost too much? I saw goodrx, but it's $75 to speak to a doctor? Can Breo be prescribed from an online doctor?"

"Doctor has prescribed:
- symbicort inhaler for preventative
- albuterol inhaler for rescue
- I have also tried a disc powder inhaler

With both inhaler spray and powder types I get a coughing attack and then progressive coughing issues/lung tightness throughout the day thanks to the initial attack from my AM dose...

This makes me very reluctant to keep taking my preventatives...

Do others struggle with this? Any other solutions/inhaler types out there?

"Do you think it‚Äôs not good to use Symbicort Turbohaler after drinking water/eating? The liquid makes everything wet inside, so when you inhale the powder it should stick to the moisture so it won‚Äôt get into the bronchus?

"I had asthma as a 2 year old and I used a nebulizer . It went away at like 4yo. 

I‚Äôm 17 and a few weeks ago I had super minor breathing problems that happened at work , it felt slightly hard to get that good grasp of air , very mild tight chest that went away pretty fast specially if I drank water. 

Fast forward now those symptoms seems not as bad , they were never bad in the first place they were just mildly annoying but  easy to ignore. I did the fitness gram pacer test today at school and when I stopped I was mildly light headed (I also pushed myself) and I was breathing fast , doesn‚Äôt sound like asthma since being light headed could be from exertion . 10/20 mins later I have a cough , it‚Äôs a dry cough but can be a wheeze sounding cough if I don‚Äôt cough normally (if I‚Äôm trying to not cough loud since I‚Äôm in a classroom . The cough sometimes felt like I had phlegm in my throat and I did so I would spit it out . 

What‚Äôs weird is that I breath easily/easier when I‚Äôm in the gym doing body weight exercises or lifting weights  . 

I feel as if it‚Äôs much easier to get that grasp of air if I inhale through my noise and I usually yawn lot to get that feeling and I‚Äôve figured out that when I breath through my nose and keep my mouth closed I can get that satisfying feeling pretty easily. 

I also have a quiet whistle sound when I inhale deeply then exhale a certain way , it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôd have to exhale unnaturally to get that sound but sometimes if I‚Äôm doing exercise/running I think it slips out but very faintly . It seems to be getting quieter (at least I hope)

Overall my symptoms seem to be getting weaker , does anyone know what I might have ? I‚Äôm not going to the doctor for personal reasons you won‚Äôt understand but the fact that it might be a chronic thing like asthma burdens me . 
Btw I‚Äôve never had any symptoms I listed until a few weeks ago."
"I've been dealing with some fatigue over the last couple of months (I thought it was something else that has since been ruled out) and I'm planning on going to see a pulmonologist about it. I haven't been diagnosed with any specific type (more like a ""well if an inhaler helps you, it's probably just asthma!"" Kind of diagnosis than anything based on testing), but I'm hoping I'll get more testing this time around.

So, what types of asthma do you have, and how does your fatigue affect you?

For me, it just feels like I have weights strapped to every part of my body. If I have the energy and the willpower, I can do anything. It's easier to do things in the morning, and it tends to get worse throughout the day, though I don't exactly wake up feeling well rested. More like, if I don't sleep, I know I'll feel even worse, and sleeping is just preventing me from feeling worse, not so much that I feel rested or satisfied with my sleep. Usually around 2 or 3 I'll have to lay down on my bed because sitting up is tiring and I have trouble with it.

I also have more trouble than I used to with basic things like going up and down stairs. My arms ached when I was sweeping earlier because if the movement, and I hadn't even been sweeping for very long."

Finally getting my inhalers tomorrow! But asthma has been causing me to cough so much my throat is now inflamed aswell can an inhaler help the throat swelling? Probably a dumb question but wanted tomake sure. So tired from being awake all night.

Hello,

I'm just trying to figure out if it is possible to have a ""fluke"" PFT test. I've passed 2 methacholine challenge tests, an exercise challenge test, and multiple PFTs with plethysmography. All showing negative.

I just took a PFT though and the results were ""extreme asthma"". I'm talking feNO of 150 ppb, 215% RV, high DLCO, fvc/fev1 &lt; 70, etc. Is there any way this could be a fluke? Can any of this be attributed to patient effort? Testing environment, etc?"
"Hello, this past weekend I went to visit a friend who had their AC breakdown a little bit ago and it's been rainy the past couple of weeks (Ida went through here last week).

I stayed 2 nights there in his room (he has an AC unit) and had felt some issues arise after the first night, but I just assumed they were average allergies. After getting home, they got worse and I was worried I had COVID, but I didn't have any of the trademark symptoms (lack of taste/smell, fever, chills, runny nose, none of that). I just had difficulty getting full breaths, bad sleep, occasional dry cough, and my sinuses are dry like I had a sneezing fit.

I was confused until I remembered I had used a toilet that he and his roommate don't use often (they each have their own and this one was an extra), which I came to discover had black mold growing under the seat/in the bowl after I had already used/flushed it a few times. I guess the small bathroom, lack of light, and no central AC in the house caused it to become a perfect breeding ground.

I take a daily 24 hr non-drowsy allergy pill and had to bust out my nebulizer both of which are helping, but am also uninsured which is making this extra fun.

I'm away from the mold and back home, but I've still been dealing with these symptoms since Sunday. Yesterday and last night were rough, but I've been feeling a little better today after using my nebulizer on the reg.

Does anyone have any experience with this? I've considered taking a hot bath or shower for the steam, but I also am worried about introducing more moisture. I am probably overly worried about it, but I just wanted to check if anyone else has dealt with a situation like this."

"So I‚Äôm a 26 year old male, relatively healthy and no underlying conditions. I‚Äôve always had seasonal allergies with ragweed being by far the worst one.

My symptoms were always the same classics such as runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes. Annoying but fairly well-controlled with otc antihistamines.

However, this summer I‚Äôve developed symptoms that are indicative of asthma; wheezing, a ton of coughing (usually productive), and mild shortness of breath, and the combination of these makes it extremely difficult to talk and get out full sentences. 

There‚Äôs a very clear correlation between these symptoms coming on and me being outdoors, especially for longer periods. Also exercise seems to worsen it as well, for example I was playing golf the other day and had to run like 200 yards back to pick up a club I had forgotten, and 3/4 of the way I started wheezing and had to sit down because I got lightheaded from not getting enough air.

So based on all that, I think the most likely case is that I‚Äôve developed allergy-induced asthma. I do have an appointment set up with my primary care doctor to address the symptoms I‚Äôve been having but the soonest I could get in is a month from now.

Anybody else have a similar experience? And any advice from asthma veterans out there on how to manage this until I can see a doctor is also appreciated!"


"I freakin fell on a puddle of water and cracked a rib. Went to the ER and confirmed it, now on pain meds. I'm in a foreign country, only been here a few weeks and don't speak the language. got prescribed painkillers but half of them are unusable as the conflict with meds im currently on.

Breathing deeply hurts (obviously) and its hard to catch air. I tried doing my peak flow meter once but exhaling hurt so bad I didn't bother trying. What should I look out for? I don't exactly have medical help here...i cant just ""ask a doctor"" because the language barrier unfortunately. thanks."
"I am a researcher, OCD by nature. I never assume anything and I ask a billion questions. I have never been relaxed‚Ä¶ever. 

When I randomly developed severe allergies and chronic cough asthma last year when I was previously never allergic to ANYTHING and never once took allergy medication, and I‚Äôm 31, I figured out I was allergic to dustmites mainly. And mold. 

Cut to VACUUM RESEARCH: i learned a lot about HEPA filters, looked into getting an air purifier, joined the Facebook allergies &amp; asthma group and was turned onto the infamous Wirecutter review of all the air purifiers. Dyson and molekule were ripped to shreds. 

‚Ä¶.Realized that vacuums need certified HEPA filters. Those HEPA filters need to be 100% sealed. I thought for sure dyson has a sealed HEPA filter vacuum‚Ä¶.I spoke with maybe 20  dyson corporate people including people in their r&amp;d. No dyson vaccuum has a completely sealed HEPA filter (like what was just implemented into their brand new T7 and T9 air purifiers, but *only* as a response to the Wirecutter article. 

So basically everything is a scam. Dyson is written up, and has provided so much material information to a ton of ‚Äúallergy friendly websites‚Äù that then market their shit and literally label it as ‚Äúsealed HEPA filter‚Äù. It‚Äôs NOT. 






‚Ä¶..So. Here I am. Wondering where I can get a fully sealed HEPA vacuum or do I just have to invent one?

Has anyone else come across this besides me? 

I have a rainbow vacuum, it has this huge massive separate HEPA filter but I don‚Äôt even think that is technically sealed- maybe it is? 

MIELE, a german brand, says they offer vaccums that have sealed HEPA filtration but who knows. They are the only ones that I see use that information on THEIR website though (an important key here)


Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!"
I have been dealing with my asthma since I moved it has been a pain in my ass I believe in to the hospital want to just because of the fact that I was sick of the pain and not being able to breathe and ended up going to urgent care and they ended up transporting me to the ER it was an OK experience nothing bad since then I‚Äôve probably had a handful of asthma attacks and never been to the hospital I had one today or am I am having one currently as I write this it‚Äôs not that bad but it could‚Äôve gotten worse I told my mom I would‚Äôve went to the hospital if we can‚Äôt really bad I left my albuterol at my boyfriends house so I wasn‚Äôt able to get it under control I am taking steroids daily and it has been working but the change the weather has been really kicking my ass I always feel like when I have an asthma attack that it‚Äôs not a big deal and that I‚Äôm not worthy enough to go to the hospital it‚Äôs very annoying and I know I should go to the hospital but like I‚Äôm just scared of being judged or like being miss treated like oh you having an asthma attack this is nothing you know because happened to me before with other things I just wondered if anybody has felt like this ;^;

I have a nebulizer at home but the thing so is violently loud. It sounds like a motorcycle inside the house. Sometimes he resists the nebulizer other times not so much, but when he does fight it the complaint is usually that it‚Äôs too loud.

I had to use my inhaler last night and morning and now my breathing is fine, but I've been having some chest pain and a high heart rate when I do things that raise it. I  should mention that the asthma flare up was probably partly caused by being in a state of high anxiety that also caused some chest pain, which is something I experience much more often than asthma flare ups, which are more of a once or twice a year event. In short, should this go away soon or should I expect to feel this way for days, especially if I have anxiety attacks throughout?"

"Basically since like quarantine, I've been resorting to using the inhaler and nebulizer whenever I had breathing problems. Like recently, for the past 2 weeks, I would wake up in the middle of the night with an attack and whenever I do something that's barely exercise, it would trigger an asthma attack and I just have to stop whatever I'm doing to treat it. I can literally just be eating or I cough really hard and I get an asthma attack, it's weird. Any ideas on why this is happening? I also noticed that whenever I would get an attack, I would cough sometimes and it would be a lot of flem/mucus coming from my throat so that might help with the idea. But yeah , any ideas would be appreciated, thx."
"I was originally on Breo Ellipta for years and it worked great for me. The insurance stopped paying for it about six months ago. I was switched to Symbicort. Wow what a nightmare. While my breathing was great I got all the crazy side effects of a steroid inhaler. The cramping in the legs, migraines, acne, and a few more. I pushed for another inhaler, any inhaler. 

They put me back on advair. Advair never worked for me in the first place. So I just stopped using it. 


I‚Äôm super anxious and annoyed. I‚Äôve had serious asthma since I was a newborn, I‚Äôm 50. I breathe better without any medication but still need the medication because my lungs crackle and pop. There are no options left except advair or symbicort.

I feel like the insurance company has no right to tell me what I need or don‚Äôt need because they can‚Äôt make smart business deal with big Pharma.

"A couple of months ago I developed iron deficiency anemia. I took iron supplements for it and, per a test last week, I am no longer anemic. However, a few of my symptoms haven't gone away entirely. I'm trying to figure out if my asthma has randomly gotten worse, since I know that if I go to a GP before I see a pulmonologist, my symptoms likely won't be taken seriously.

Specifically, I have pretty bad fatigue and brain fog. This was much worse with the anemia, but it definitely isn't at a ""normal"" level now. Im crazy forgetful all the time. I also have some pain and soreness, usually around my arms or legs. When I move, even just walking around, it almost feels like I have weights attached to my arms. This doesn't technically limit me, in simple movements at least, but it's definitely caused issues with my energy level when it comes to really basic things like walking my dog or going to the store. I was trying to clean a really dirty pan and it took me several hours because I had to keep taking breaks for my fingers sake (which is crazy because I've done fast food work and I've detailed things before and it's never been this bad)

If any of y'all have experience with this, I'd really appreciate hearing about it. I'm not convinced my asthma is fully managed (I went to a pulmonologist in may who did a spirometry which they said came back normal, so we didn't change anything about my treatment despite me complaining about it feeling like it wasn't managed) and I'm probably going to ask for further testing. If you have any advice for how to advocate for myself, I'd really appreciate it ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"First time after 30 years I‚Äôm getting diagnosed with asthma‚Ä¶ they prescribed me breo Ellipta 200/25 . I have anxiety and I‚Äôm scared to take anything‚Ä¶ does this drug make you feel bad or anything? I‚Äôm super scared to try it, but know I need it. Any advice is appreciated ! Thanks!!"
"I've been on it for 3 days now and I've noticed significant improvement in my coughing and wheezing, but its not COMPLETELY gone yet. haven't used a ventolin since symbicort though."
I've heard the salty air is good for the lungs and the constant wind blows away pollution and allergens. Plus in old books doctors are always recommending sick people go to the beach.

"I was about 3-4 years old and nearly stopped breathing. I was sent to the ER and sort of blacked out. I woke up with a kind nurse who taught me how to use a peak-flow meter and inhaler for the first time.

Just curious how you all found out."

"Peak flow dropped below 80% I have no inhaler as I am being tested for asthma. I see the doctor on Tuesday.

Went to minor injury unit (closest hospital) quickly the nurse said ""well your not having trouble talking are you"" this sort of thing carried on the whole time causing me to have anxiety on top.

She basically thinks it was just anxiety and if I did have asthma it would be mild. 
But now I'm anxious to go to the doctors on Tuesday because I feel that I am making a big deal out of nothing and I probably don't have asthma anyway.

Is there any point in being tested if it might just be anxiety?"
"Hi All,

Been trying to figure out for the last 2 years what has been affecting my breathing; constant congestion; throat clearing; when I cough up small amounts of phlegm (usually upon waking) the more I cough I feel more of a bronchspasm/SOB feeling. Expiratory is worse. Ruled out GERD. I have tried singular for 30 days, and other over the counter stuff with no luck. My PCP had a sample of Breztri, but did say this might be overkill for me. He said try it for a week and let me know how it goes. I used it for 1 day (2 puffs in the morning and two in the late afternoon), and roughly 4 hours after my last use I started feeling pretty weird. Throughout the night I could not sleep (most likely attributing to the steroid), but then I started spiking a fever (up to 100.5), mild chills, and overall malaise/fatigue. I looked on the Breztri website and it did show all of my symptoms as possible side effects. I have never known a medication to elicit a fever! All in all it felt like I had mild flu like symptoms. I do not have diagnosed asthma and/or COPD. I will be going to make an appt with an allergist to do some more testing. Just passing this along for those who might venture into Breztri."
"Hi all,

I'm 30 year old male in the UK and have asthma all my life and noticed sonething. Im particular about the inhalers I have especially the brand. Let me explain :)

I used to the use the Salamol inhaler. The normal blue one. Quite small. But it used to get blocked all the time. The puffs would slowly come and I would be forever cleaning it.

Then I was prescribed Ventolin Or Salbutomol. This again is blue but it slightly bigger and tastes different. Same drug but a brand

This never ever blocked. I treated it exactly the same and it never got clogged and never failed on me. Handy when you need it in a pinch.

How can something so similar be so different? 

Has anyone else experienced this in the UK or anywhere else for that matter?

Thanks :)"
"So this is a new one for me, or at least the first time I've noticed the connection.

We got new kimchi today and opened it, smell hit and I was fine but didn't really like it. Put it in a bowl with rice and sit to eat, then I started coughing. I make the connection and abandon the food to sit by a window with the fan on, now my breath is short but I'm not in a full-blown attack yet and am just wondering why I react to fermented vegetables of all things.

Does anyone else react to certain foods? Fermented foods in particular? Is it a specific ingredient?

My doctor's office isn't open until Monday and I just waste $10 on food I apparently can't eat. Fun."
I react rather poorly to Ventolin. It gives me tachycardia and causes tremors/shaking that lasts for a prolonged time. My asthma isn‚Äôt particularly severe but induced by exercise and I‚Äôm a high performance athlete who‚Äôs training load has increased due to preparing for international competition and it‚Äôs starting to mess me up. I was told a spacer might help lessen side effects and wondering if anyone else finds that to be the case? I currently don‚Äôt use Ventolin and just kinda lie on the floor until I can breathe againüòÇ

"it is hard to find a rental apartment that doesnt have carpet in the bedroom. Many have tiles or laminate etc in the lounge but seem to default to carpet in the bedroom. 

A solution I just thought of was having some type of barrier for the bedroom floor so that I could rent a place with carpet in the bedroom. 

I have done this temporarily with tarpaulin (anything waterproof does the job) but having a plastic tarpaulin on the floor isnt very comfortable or aesthetic. So I am wondering if anyone has any ideas about some type of waterproof rug that would cover most of the bedroom carpet and still look like it is meant to be there. It would need to be short pile (or somehow no pile) to stop dust mites building up in the rug and the waterproofed underside would isolate the existing mites in the carpet. 

Any ideas about this or advice? 

Thanks"
"hi so uh i don‚Äôt have asthma. but i just remembered when i was, like, 5-6 or something, i did have asthma. i had an inhaler and all. i remember having difficulties breathing and i had to breathe really hard but it wouldn‚Äôt feel like i had enough oxygen. so i think i had asthma. but somewhere along the way, it just disappeared? i told my friends that i used to have asthma and they were like? that‚Äôs not possible? uhhh so yeah.."

Does anyone else have experience with beta blockers? Will this improve at all as my body gets used to the meds? Could I try a maintenance med for my asthma. I really really don‚Äôt want to stop the metoprolol"
"Hey guys, just listened to James Nestor on the Joe Rogan podcast. Really interesting stuff, I am definitely going to listen to the audio book now. I especially like the way he is very honest in how he is saying he is not a doctor or a breath therapist, just a journalist and that his recommendations do not replace your medicines. 

I wrote some of the key takeaways on a respiratory blog I am working on. Let me know what you guys think and subscribe if your are interested in topics like that. I would definitely recommend giving it a listen in any case.

"I‚Äôm F20s, slightly overweight, and I have exercise-induced asthma.

I want to try going to the gym for the social aspect of it, but I always psych myself out thinking of how embarrassing it‚Äôll be to be the loudest, least-fit person in the room.

Do you ever get embarrassed wheezing while working out? How do you get past it?"
"So I've had asthma since Inwas young but it's always been mild and rare. Since I moved for work and moved in with my cousin, it has come back with a vengence. I'm 100% that it is related to her SEVEN cats that she has. I can't breathe, have a stuffy nose, wheezing, sneezing, etc. And the breathing is cured by my rescue inhaler to a point. The stuffiness stays. When I leave the house, my symptoms clear up so I am sure of the direct correlation. Anyways, I have 3 air purifiers in my room, keep everything clean, and try to keep my door closed. It still doesn't help. I am using my rescue inhaler twice a day and often wake up due to not being able to breathe. I have a phlemy cough now too which I think may be due to overuse of the inhaler. My doctor prescribed my Alvesco inhalation aerosol and montekaust/singulair. I have read up on the side effects of these and feel nervous to take them. Does anyone have any recommendations in this situation or have any experience with these medications working in a similar situation? Any advice helps. Thank you."

"Hi guys,

I would like to ask you how do you treat your asthma, especially allergy based asthma. My doctor said that I need to take my whole life formoterol (Atimos 2x1) and Ciclesonide (Alvesco 2x2).

I stopped taking anything 2 months ago on holidays and I don't have any symptoms at all. Nothing. I feel healthy. Before I have started taking medication every day I had mild symptoms during summer (allergic to pollen) and I was smoking cigarettes, so sometimes after party and only strong reaction when spending longer time in a closed space with animals. Now I am after 5 years of desensitization to pollens, I quit smoking. I am after sinus surgery which stopped chronic inflammation which caused bronchitis. I don't experience any allergic reaction or asthmatic. I don't belive I should still taking asthma medication but my doctor desn't agree with mee.

Does anyone experience something similar? Do you take your medication all year? Is it a common approach in other countries to take medication every day?"
"Hi, I just wanted some advice on what you guys think has happened.  I will be going to the doctor soon, but I can't wait so I'm asking here.  Ever since I was a child, I've had breathing problems.  I had pneumonia when I was one, and then severe childhood asthma up until I was around eight.  It stopped entirely, and now all these years later I just had an attack.  At first, I assumed I was just out of breath from going up my stairs (which I'm usually not), but it got worse until I struggled to breathe.  After I took Ventolin, it went away completely.  Is this likely to be ongoing, as in my asthma has come back indefinitely or do you think it was a one-off?"

"I switched from a daily corticosteroid to a daily corticosteroid+slow acting bronchiodilater. Since then I've been having strong feelings of anger very frequently. The timing might be coincidental since that's also when I went through a huge stressor, but I'm wondering if the meds could have caused this? Google doesn't seem to have an answer."
"My daughter has a prescription for the latter and we can't get a hold of her doctor for a refill at the moment. Haven't been able to for over a week now. She's at the end of her current inhaler and she's 3 days into a very mild asthmatic event. My mom has a full APO-Salbutamol HFA in the same dose that she hasn't touched yet, that she said we can have. Are they the same? Is it something we can use for a few days? We've got an appointment with a different doctor for Monday, but will this get us by until then? Does the APO actually mean anything?"
"In my experience, that spacer is much better, and I feel it delivers the meds MUCH MUCH better than aerochamber. I think its worth a shot if your asthma is out of control, and you use aerochamber."

It's crazy how far I made it out and I'm so grateful I'm here today. 19 years?? I was supposed to be dead at 1. And I was supposed to die this year too. Symbicort saved me from evolution by natural selection.

"Last night was the last straw, I woke up every hour or so coughing because of wildfire smoke. Did a frantic Google search as soon as I woke up and decided to buy an air filter for my bedroom, as well as some N95 masks for when I go outside.

"Hey guys, i ve been struggling with asthma for some time now. It all started in March 2020 with constant cough. Its not dry cough, but with phlegm. I ve been to my alergologist, i had the spiromethry test (what a bull\*hit). He took my blood and afaik, im allergic to dust, specifically dust mites and that triggers my asthma. He prescribed me an Alvesco and Ventolin. I need to tell you, that my doctor is totally incompetent and he told me almost nothing. I didnt know anything about asthma as im 22 years old and never had any problem. So i had to look it up all on internet. I started using Alvesco (1x puff a day) - it was good for a like 1 month. I was almost like a normal person again (without coughing)...After that, my symptoms came back - i called my doctor and he told me that its not worth to take 1x puff twice a day and told me, that i should take ventolin. The thing is, i cant go without ventolin and i dont want to use it every day. So by myself, i started to do 1x puffs twice a day Alvesco. My symptoms dissapeared. After a week, all is back the same. Im desperate, i cant take ventolin every day. I am terrified, that my body is immune to the Alvesco. 

I also need to tell you, that i live in extremely humid apartment - Yesterday morning, there was 80% humidity. Now, i have dehumidifier running and humidity is currently 65%. And it rarely goes below the 60%, even when the dehumidifier is running. And when i will open the window, the humidity is back. I dont know what to do. All day, every day i am coughing phlegm and im so tired of it. My alergologist doesnt tell me a sh\*t. I dont know, should i buy better dehumidifier? Should i buy an air purifier? And i cant move anywhere else and also, i need to be in this room, as we had online lectures. Also, my symptoms are better, when i am cycling or i am in the nature. 

Another thing guys, tomorrow i will have my first Pfizer shot and im terrified as hell. My asthma is not good and i will probably be on the Ventolin all time. Guys you, who are vaccinated with severe asthma, how did it go? 

I am really sorry for this long post, but i need help from some of you. How could i ease my symptoms.

When I'm out cycling or going for a walk, I never really feel my asthma, but when I'm at my desk in my home, I do.

ive noticed that when i drink caffeine in any substantial amount it seems to cause me reactions like asthma, fatigue, brain fog / difficulty focusing. i drink caffeine every day, and i begin to notice symptoms immediately if i drink coffee or black tea. with green tea, it usually doesnt immediately begin, but if i drink any additional cups itll show up. the symptoms can\* subside if i do extensive breathing exercises or if i exercise in general. another thing i notice is i have a lot of difficulty singing, and that it takes me an hour minimum to be able to sing much of anything.... 

ive had general health issues for probably.... 5 years that havent been entirely diagnosed properly ( namely, breathing stuff and fatigue ) . but im realizing caffeine might be a big trigger and im wondering what are possible 

if been wondering lately if i have MCAS and/or histamine intolerance so that is a possibility ! im also wondering if it might be just.... too much caffeine / anxiety ? maybe even a caffeine intolerance ? 

i definitely have generalized anxiety disorder but i generally dont believe its that - i have a pretty good handle on it and the symptoms from caffeine seem to be far more physical than psychological/ somatic ( i know they are connected but it just feels like a reaction and not how i usually experience anxiety ) 

&amp;#x200B;

what are the potential reasons for this kind of reaction ? did i miss any ? do any of them sound more likely than the others ?"

"I was diagnosed with asthma in infancy but wasn't treated during later childhood, teens, and 20s because I ""grew out of it"". Looking back, I realize I've struggled with breathing my whole life. I just didn't realize it.

As a result, I have become conditioned to chest tightness and shortness of breath. I don't usually notice a flare up until I start getting annoyed that I can't get a full breath and then I realize ""oh shoot. This is not good!"" 

Yesterday was so bad I needed the ER but they're over run with Covid patients, and Urgent Care was a minimum 3 hour wait. So I found a random telehealth provider who gave me Wixela, Prednisone, and Albuterol. I will be meeting with a specialist and getting an antihistamine and controller medication ASAP. 

TL;DR - I became conditioned to breathing problems and didn't know I was struggling. Now I'm trying to take it seriously and not minimize or ignore when I feel out of breath or tight."

One night I sleep well without any coughs, next night I wake up 1-2 times because of an asthma attack, next night I sleep well again and so on.

Literally my gums were bleeding so bad my spit was just red. i feel stuck and lost and i feel like this was kinda my last chance, my doctor said if this didnt work she wanted to put me through a round of prednisone.

Asthmatics (at the moments when one's asthma flairs or becomes uncontrolled for a while when you are hunting for a medicine that works/ severe asthmatics) are deprived of such a simple joy, a joy that most people take for granted.

"I'm one of them, trust me I know; stupid. Smoking cigarettes from 15-22, was able to quit and picked up vaping from then until now, I am currently 26. I was able to drop it for 4 days, I'm not even addicted to the nicotine. It's just complete oral fixation at this point. God, I want to quit.

I decided to quit cigarettes when I was coughing up black phlegm regularly, every day like clockwork. I was able to quit cigarettes for about a year and then picked them up again and went to vaping to attempt to curb the habit. Success! Well, now I have daily cough with slightly brown tinted phlegm! Hooray. Xrays, CT scans, etc. show the all clear (has been about 2 years since those tests). 

So, either A) smoking/vaping is just pissing off my lungs, or B) I may have upgraded to chronic bronchitis, in which case: fuck.

I've been having issues with my allergies. In Jan I had nasal polyps removed and a deviated septum corrected. I have bouts where I can smell and taste. Then all of a sudden it just goes away. Prednisone usually will make my sense of smell and taste return. I have blown my nose lately and had a  few occasions where it was tinged with bright red blood not darker so I am assuming it's dried out nasal passages. I am past tired if the not being able to smell and taste. I have been  tested multiple times for Covid but it's not Covid. Has anyone  else experienced anything similar and of so what if anything were you able to do to regain smell and taste. So frustrated.

"Since I was a child, I would get 'attacks' in the summer where I'd wake up with the upper back and under the chin itching, a dry cough, and wheezing. I hadn't had an attack for years and then a couple of years ago I had it again, and a few weeks ago had it again. As a child I was given a brown inhaler (UK) and I think I remember reading in my medical records once that I had allergic asthma. My grandfather also inhalers. I'm just trying to determine what I've got and determine my risk to COVID as well."
"This is the worst post I'll ever make.

I am a sufferer of asthma ‚Äì since I was little. I've had my lungs collapse a couple times and needed to be put on oxygen. From then on, I regularly use inhalers. My asthma is triggered by dust, pollen, the cold, and too much physical exertion.

Tomorrow is my medical check up for the military as per the conscription process (forced enrollment in the military). I imagine conscription is tough for everyone in the world but where I live, it's particularly bad. Process for conscription alone has so far proved to be the worst thing I have ever experienced.

Tomorrow I will be examined by a pulmonologist (I think). Despite my history with asthma and my regular use of inhalers, my case for inability to participate will probably be dismissed because I will appear fine ‚Äì and I \*am\* fine. They will not care that I suffer from it and can only prevent it through access to water, my inhaler, and a controlled environment.

One thing that will definitely distinguish me though is if I'm actively suffering. This means if I'm wheezing and having difficulty breathing, they will take me seriously.

Before anyone asks, yes military doctors here are incredibly shallow, unfocused, and mechanistic. They do not care about attending to your situation in a full capacity nor do they care about identifying nuances. If they think that 'you're faking it', they will make you participate.

Please help find ways to trigger my asthma. Whether it's a certain breathing technique (or lack thereof)."
"I started having an asthma flare up back in March. It took them until June to figure out that it was my asthma because I haven't had active asthma since I was a little kid (I'm 29 now). I haven't had to use an inhaler and the only time it ever caused me issues was when I was around smoke. They try and rescue inhaler and it didn't do anything. Then they put me on Flovent and it helped but I still have a persistent cough and I still have moderate attacks. They wanted me to do a pulmonary function test before giving me anything else so I did and it came back that I have breathing problems but there was no difference between my breathing problems before and after and Albuterol breathing treatment.

I'm trying to get in to see a pulmonologist but with Covid they're in high demand. In the meantime my primary care physician is trying different inhalers to see if we can find one that works. I tried to Advair and after only one day I was significantly worse. I was back to having a near constant cough and having big attacks that left me having to sit down and recover. Now I'm trying Breo and it does seem like my asthma has gotten a little bit worse after 2 days on Breo but I'm not sure if I should give in a little longer before I call my doctor again. I'm posting here because I know his nurse isn't getting the information to him correctly and I don't want him to just call something new in if waiting on Breo is worthwhile. Should I give it some time or move on to the next one?"
"Hey folks, just wanted to get your thoughts on nebulizers vs spacers? I currently have a spacer but not a nebulizer, and was thinking of getting one. My breathing is bad at the moment but not terrible, and I can take in a deep breath. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the two, and also any recommendations for nebulizers that you may have."
"My 68 year old dad seems to have developed CVA randomly. He has always had some athsma symptoms around direct mold exposure, but for the past 8 weeks he's had just a dry cough with a little phlegm that came out of nowhere and it's getting worse and worse. His chest xray the other day was fine. His Dr put him on symbicort and Allegra a week ago, but it hasn't helped. Antibiotics in case there is a slight infection in there hasn't helped. He's already on 5mg prednisone daily bc his is a donor kidney recipient. He can't get into pulmonologist till October. What has worked for you to treat the nagging cough? It's starting to affect his quality of life and during covid we are already on edge with him getting that bc he's immune compromised and the constant coughing is so unnerving. It's even starting to wake him up at night. :(."
I had asthma all my life and I do take my medications daily but the one discovery I made if I slowly warm my body before accelerating my work output i take a little rest in between accelerating work pace so my heart beat catches up with my breathing so I don't feel like I can't breath I feel alot better but if i only accelerate with out taking breather in between times I have hard time trying to catch up with my breathing so I do ride a bicycle to the store and I preform the same cycle slow down I let my breathing catch up and begin again and if I feel I'm having hard time catching up breathing I will stop ridding and wait into my body has catch and my breathing feels normal then slowly ride the bike taking my time but everyone asthma is different some people are less active than others but I been ridding a bicycle all my life I even take long walks and I have allergy triggers and if I feel there's something in room that triggers my asthma it will be gone the next day because the more triggers you have from allergies you don't give time for lungs to recover and you become more prone to asthma breakouts.
"Sorry for the TMI! Just a little background, I had been diagnosed with adult onset asthma after I moved to a country with cold temperatures. No one else in my family has asthma or my symptoms. 

I got put on Symbicort when I lived in Europe then in the US, advair. I get ‚Äúexacerbations‚Äù about once a year if I‚Äôm careful enough, and in the past my doctors have always put me on Z-pack and Prednisone which seems to do the trick. This time round I‚Äôm currently dealing with it and the doctor only gave me prednisone to help expel mucus and a rescue inhaler. I‚Äôve seen a pulmonologist but he was terrible and I need to find a new one. 

What helps some of you to bring it up? I‚Äôve been drinking plenty of fluids since I started feeling the exacerbation as well."
"Wondering if anyone has experience with having trouble sleeping while taking Prednisone? And if so, have you tried Valerian root, Chamomile or melatonin? 
I‚Äôve read thing that say it‚Äôs okay these supplements and other things that say do not use sleep aids when you have asthma, so I really don‚Äôt know what to believe. 
Yes, I‚Äôm going to ask my doctor but I can‚Äôt speak with them until tomorrow and I‚Äôd like to get some sleep tonight. 
Thank you in advance!"
"2 days ago on Thursday I had to be sent home after going to gym and having a BPM of 170 and chest pain. Then a day ago I developed a sinus infection, today I have been having asthma attacks right after another. Earlier I didn‚Äôt know that I had asthma until my mom told me that when I was younger I had to have breathing treatments with albuterol because ragweed triggers real bad attacks. Wonderful right?  Did any of you learn the hard way about your asthma too?"
"
This past winter I (21f) moved to a city, where my house sits right on the side of a highway, and 1/4 mile from the freeway. The air quality is usually awesome here (northern Minnesota, so lots of trees and this city is very nature-oriented). But I noticed that going for runs in my neighborhood near the highway were becoming extremely difficult ‚Äî my pace was slower than it‚Äôs ever been, and I was struggling to breathe more and more. Running in the winter made me wheeze and cough more than ever, even though I‚Äôve coughed a bit in cold weather my entire life. 

I‚Äôm a pretty healthy person, but I was worried I might have developed asthma on top of a couple seasonal allergies I have. Apparently my mother (who is not in my life anymore), developed severe asthma and allergies in her early twenties. I went to the doctor and she gave me a prescription for an Albuterol inhaler for before my runs. I noticed it helped a lot, as it cut about 2 minutes off my mile times immediately (bringing me back to my usual times) and I didn‚Äôt feel nearly as exhausted after runs. 

This spring, I started getting what I think are asthma attacks or flare-ups a few times a week ‚Äî often brought on by allergies and high humidity. I went back to my doctor and started on Montelukast (on top of my daily Xyzal and albuterol as needed). 

This summer, my breathing was still troublesome and forest fires started in Canada and northern Minnesota. The smoke has become my worst enemy ‚Äî I plan my days around wind direction and AQI. I went back to my doctor and she added a Flovent inhaler 2x a day. 

That week, the forest fires near me really started to act up, and I ended up in the ER unable to breathe after working outdoors at my job all day. I felt much better after the doctor gave me a high dose of Prednisone and 3 DuoNeb treatments. He sent me home with a nebulizer machine, a prescription for DuoNeb, and a magical thing for my inhaler called a spacer, which no other doctor has ever mentioned to me. The spacer has been a game changer for the effectiveness of my inhalers. As the forest fires continue, this arsenal of medicine has become a necessity for me. I have to carry my Albuterol on me at all times, and it‚Äôs to the point where I don‚Äôt go to work without my entire nebulizer kit as well. 

Since I‚Äôm still having issues, I was referred to an allergist for allergy testing. My appointment still isn‚Äôt until the end of September. My issue, though, is that no doctor has done any actual asthma testing on me ‚Äî they keep sending me away with more and more medication to rely on, and the most they‚Äôve done is listened to my lungs with a stethoscope and said they sound ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù

Has anyone experienced anything similar, or have an inkling as to what might be going on? I‚Äôm not looking for medical advice, moreso support, or tips to at least get me until this allergy testing in a little under a month. This has been devastating for me, as a runner, a person who works outdoors for the Dept of Natural Resources full time, and who wants to go into firefighting as a career. Thanks for reading and for any input you may have :)"

"i just had a fit after using my maitienence puffer and coughed from so deep in my lungs that it wrenched my back, is there a proper way to ""hack up a lung"" that doesnt fucking hurt so much?"
33f newly diagnosed with they think environmental asthma. I‚Äôve noticed some odd dizziness - almost like a lag when I turn my head that makes me feel a bit off balance? Maybe that‚Äôs more like vertigo. It‚Äôs mild but frequent. My hands also shake like a leaf now which has never happened to me before. Thumbs shaking as I type this. Anyone had a similar experience?

"I could use some help with setting a boundary. I know one needs to be set, but I'm struggling to follow through.

But they just got a puppy (like yesterday.) is hypo allergenic (theoretically), but they didn't ask about bringing a dog when we agreed to them moving back in, AND I'm super allergic to dogs, even doodles and other hypoallergenic breeds.

My asthma is already struggling quite a bit from the constant smoke from the wildfires (I‚Äôve been doing frequent nebulizer treatments) and the thought of adding constant exposure to a dog on top of that is a bad formula. 

I love my Bro and want him to feel always welcome here, yet this is an immediate concern. I'm not sure of any alternative options, though, to provide with a boundary...."

"I bought it on eBay just because it is a cheap thing to try (17$).  


Of course, I don't believe anything about its healing or ""curing"" stuff, but I'm curious to know to what extent did it improve/worsen your Asthma, so I could know better what to expect.  


P.S: I'm 179-180 cm &amp; 96.6 kg (Lately, I've also lost some weight lately, I was studying so hard during the last year in the university, that I actually forgot about doing some essential sports. Thankfully, done with the undergraduate before the upcoming Master)."
"I currently use the AstraZeneca Symbicort 120 inhalation inhaler.  Over the last year or so, I have found that as I get closer to the yellow zone, the medication does not seem to work as well.  It is almost as if the medication is not equal in each puff and that as you approach and enter the yellow zone, you are receiving less and less medication each puff.  

I have also noticed that as I approach the yellow zone, I am increasing the use of the rescue inhaler.  When I start a new symbicort, the use of the rescue inhaler is again reduced to near never. 

Has anyone else noticed this issue?"
"I know this probably sounds silly, but I'd really appreciate any feedback. Over the past month, I've had a dry cough, some shortness of breath, and rib/back/shoulder pain. It comes and goes. It also feels like there's always mucus in my throat. I'm negative for COVID - had two tests a week apart. Also fully vaccinated. I had a scary experience at urgent care a few weeks ago where the doctor suggested I go to the ER to get evaluated for a pulmonary embolism (as someone with health anxiety this sent me into a spiral). I ended up not going, but visited my regular doctor who did a d-dimer. It was normal. I also have no risk factors -- no smoking, birth control, long recent trips, I move around a lot at my job. I still made an appointment with a pulmonologist just to get checked out and rule out possible asthma or other issues to be safe. When making an appointment they said they'll be doing a PFT. I'm very worried. Mostly because COVID is getting bad again. I saw from ""online research"" (I know, not the most reliable) you have to breath into all these tubes/machines. Do you think it's safe? Is there a big chance I could get COVID from the test? I'm going to the doctors office. And need a negative covid test before appointment. I'm considering cancelling and just hoping everything is okay. I‚Äôve been feeling a little better. My symptoms have been coming and going, so I wonder if a lot of it is anxiety and I might get sick for real by going to the doctor 24/7."
"I've had asthma my whole life which has greatly improved in my teens, however colds still make me quite wheezy.

"Greetings Fellow Asthmanaughts,

Did I do that right?  I‚Äôm new.  Well, sort of.  I could really use advice.

My mom smoked around me when I was a kid.  My childhood asthma was bad.  Steam showers, nebulizers, inhalers, bronchitis every time I was sick.

Once I started playing lots of sports around age 10, I never noticed it again until now, about 20 years later.  Things are different.  Instead of sports, I rarely exercise, especially these past 2 years.  I never used to smoke/vape, but I did a fair amount the past ~10 years (with no noticeable issues).  I currently do not smoke/vape at all.

Last weekend, I couldn‚Äôt have been any worse to my poor lungs.  I was on vacation in Sequoia which is close to a wildfire right now, and we could smell the smoke for the 4 days we were there.  I was on vacation, so I smoked and vaped some but not that much.  I was the lucky first one in the hot tub and received what I can only describe as the heaviest dose of vaporized chlorine I‚Äôve ever inhaled.  I had to get out - eyes burning, couldn‚Äôt breathe.  That didn‚Äôt last long, no skin irritation, able to enjoy the tub the rest of the weekend.  Surprisingly, no general breathing trouble all weekend despite that onslaught.

First night home Monday, no trouble, but that next morning, this past Tuesday, I woke up a few hours early because I was wheezing.  Couldn‚Äôt get air, couldn‚Äôt sleep.  Eventually subsided later in the day.  The same thing has happened to me every morning this week since, and I‚Äôm exhausted.  I have a rescue inhaler, never used it before, never needed it, finally did today and breathing was relieved immediately (still couldn‚Äôt sleep due to steroid).  It is worth mentioning our cat sleeps with us.  Again, no issues in the past, but certainly a potential contributor.

Is it possible my childhood asthma simply and coincidently caught up with me and this isn‚Äôt abnormal?  If so, why is this only happening early morning?  Is it possible I just over did it a bit this weekend, and I‚Äôll be back to usual in a few days?  Is it possible something more serious is going on due to the chlorine incident or something else?  I read about a scary chlorine incident that sent people to the hospital, but I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve needed emergency care the past few days.

I‚Äôm cv19 vaccinated, may have had cv19 in the past or not - no idea, no other symptoms, and can breathe fine during the day, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like I need an emergency room.  I‚Äôm just tired af and trying to figure out what is happening and what to do.

Should I take the rescue inhaler (albuterol) more often?  If so, how often do y‚Äôall typically take it?  My doctor told me to let him know when I use it, and I think I understand correctly using it too often can result in diminishing returns.  I just don‚Äôt want to use it improperly.

Are there any other ‚Äònew to asthma‚Äô steps you‚Äôd recommend?

Thanks for your time and any help you can offer.

- one sleepy, not so breathey dude"
"Does anyone know where I can purchase Ventolin or any Albuterol inhalers over the counter without a doctors prescription?  I don't have health care insurance and my doctor cut me off! They want me to have an appointment &amp; I don't want to pay them $172.00 for a 10 min chat on facetime! :(  Is there anyway around this.  Albuterol is a relatively safe drug, personally I think it should be over the counter anyway.  Anyone's input is greatly appreciated!"

"If there was, say a pill, that you could mix into somebody's food, that would get them to end up having severe uncontrolled persistent asthma, and you could get away without anyone knowing you did it, would you give that pill to anyone?

Maybe the people that bullied you when you were a kid? Maybe one of your great enemies? 

I know this is extremely controversial, what I'm asking."
"trigger warning: i guess you shouldnt read this if texts about suicide/depression trigger you.

hello,

im 32 years old, 2 years ago i was diagnosed with severe eosinophilic asthma.

since then my life has totally changed because of my suffering.

a CT of my lungs showed that they are actaually quite ok. but:

not a single day has gone by where i feel ''ok'' - im fighting for air the whole time.

i lost all my ''friends'' and social contacts since i feel like shit the whole time.

the state sent me into early retirement because of the severity of my illness.

my lung doctor prescribed me FASENRA - which was able to bring down the eosinophiles in my blood - but nothing changed regarding my asthma or lung function - he also said that ''the prognosis is not good''

i take 3 different sprays, a lot of pills, a lot of herbs that can potentially help relief the symptomps - nothing helps.

i walk 3 hours a day to try and find relief - doesnt help.

my mum and dad are both doctors of medicine - they dont know how to help me.

i feel like i have reached the end of my journey. this illness is breaking me. i feel like im done. i have thought about suicide for a long time now. im getting closer.

the last few weeks i started abusing benzos and alcohol just to get me through the days - but i dont want this life - i feel like im better off gone.

i dont know what to do."


So in September the vaccine becomes available to my age group. People over the age of 18 and between 30. I've registered for it. But I was wondering. Those that took the vaccine. How did it feel? Anything much change? How will it affect my Asthma? Any explanations or answers will be appreciated.
Anytime I get sick I get a really bad cough because of my asthma. I‚Äôve been that way since I was a kid. I don‚Äôt have Covid.
"My company is returning to the office next week with our masks or social distancing and a vague promise to ‚Äúclean more.‚Äù I like working in an office normally but am feeling apprehensive, particularly because of my asthma. 

My area of the US is not terrible right now but we have rates about the same as we did last August. I am vaccinated but I‚Äôm feeling apprehensive. My asthma is typically triggered by colds and flus and it often takes me an extra month to recover after I get sick, even with oral steroids (in addition to my regular asthma meds). I keep seeing mixed messages about asthma and COVID but I can‚Äôt help but feel that if I get COVID it will linger with me longer than most (based on how my lungs deal with being sick in general)

My company is very pro-in-office but my boss (VP) is very supportive of my needs. If I need to push back against the return to office he has said he will support me and let me do what I need to do. I tentatively told him I don‚Äôt feel comfortable returning yet. 

So my question: am I making too big a deal about not wanting to return yet? How are those of you who are returning handling it? If you have returned how are you keeping yourself safe (when others perhaps are not)?"


"For those of you who've caught RSV, how long did it take for your lungs to recover? And how the heck do you stay on top of the symptoms so you don't feel like you're *dying.* Tonight was my first night back at work and I'm struggling, even now that I'm home. I haven't struggled this much since before my first dose of fasenra."
"I just started Prednisone 60mg for 5 days because I‚Äôm trying to gain control of my asthma. Yesterday I took my first dose (60mg in the morning) and It did make me feel so much better, I was very pleased that I could get up and do activities/ go outside with out feeling breathless.. but at the end of the day when I was trying to go to bed it was so hard to fall asleep and I could feel a head ache coming on. Then, around 2am I woke up to the worst head ache I‚Äôve ever experienced. My head hurt so bad I was shaking, sweating and experienced waves of nausea, Every breath I took was excruciating..
I called my doctor early today and she didn‚Äôt get back to me until later in the evening, she told me to continue taking the medication and just take a pain reliever in the evening. Because she got back to me so late I haven‚Äôt taken any prednisone today and my brains been pretty foggy. 
I don‚Äôt know how I feel about taking it tomorrow :("

"So I‚Äôm being put through the asthma tests as the title says. So far I‚Äôve done a 6-minute speed walk (160bpm/98 oxy), I was put in this glass case and did a bunch of breathing drills, I ran for 8 minutes on a treadmill and then did 21 minutes of breathing exercises (no noticeable shortness of breath after). 

Tomorrow I am being given the methacoline (sp?) test. What is the desired result of that test to NOT be asthmatic? I assume I just want to be breathing worse and lower oxygen levels than after the walk/run tests? Anyone have any insight?"
"im getting confused as to how store my fostair inhaler with the pharamacist syaing to keep stored in the fridge at all times, but the instructions only sya store it before first use then make sure it doesnt go above 20 degrees after, and now im not sure how im meant to store it"
"Will keep this brief.

I went for a pulmonary function test a few months back. I never got the specific value of my results but I was told that all my tests came back normal and within range for my age (30) and size.

One thing which was noted was that I wheezed quite a bit during the forced exhale. But no further investigation was performed on that matter. 

When I Google it I get mixed results. Some say it's normal and healthy people do it. Some seem to focus more on people with asthma and COPD doing it. 

I've replicated this forced exhale at home many times and every single time I wheeze. I've always suspected from my late teens I may have mild asthma but it's never been bothersome enough to cause any significant issues. 

Anyway as a smoker I'm worried about copd but normal spirometry suggests that shouldn't be an issue. I have no other regular wheezing other than this forced exhale. So could it just be normal or even slight adult onset asthma?"
"Been having shortness of breath and laboured breathing for about a month now with just anxiety as my diagnosis so far. My inhalers have not been helping. I bought a finger oximeter for peace of mind and during day it is always 95-99%. Last night felt particularly SOB so slept with it next to me .woke up with burning feeling in lungs and sob and quicky checked me O2. It was low 80s and went back up to 98 when I started breathing manually.

I'm terrified to fall asleep again. Should I go to the ER? I won't get a drs appt for a few days."
"New to asthma, and have been put on a steroid inhaler for just over 2 weeks now. There‚Äôs been some improvement, but it‚Äôs been quite slow and the pulmonologist just increased my dose. 

I‚Äôm pretty much at the end of my tether‚Ä¶how long did it take for you guys to get your asthma under control?"

I'm not sure if this is common but this just started last week and I have no clue why. I (16M) have had asthma my whole life and used an albuterol inhaler and nebulizer to help with it. But these past few days I've been experiencing really bad asthma flare-ups specifically at night. I will be fine the entire day and then at night when trying to sleep I cough and can't breathe well. I've gone to the doctor and ER because it's gotten so bad that I can't sleep. I'm hoping someone on here has had a similar experience and can give some advice.

"Last december i got medically diagnosed with asthma and my doctor at the time was a condescending douche and he only gave me albuterol.
I went to a new doctor around march and shes gave me flovent. Flovent was really pricy and overall just made my asthma worse even though i used it as directed. Im supposed to have something new today but it costs more than flovent and my mom didnt want to buy it. Am i just getting screwed here? 
Ps. The doctor said that this new inhaler was like a mixture of two medicines."

" I was at the play ground with my son and stupidly forgot my mask but since there was no one there I figured it would be okay. A man who was at the pool next door approached us and started making converstation. Since we live in Texas and the majority here doesnt wear masks I asked if he had covid. He asked if it would matter if he did and of coarse I said yes because I have respiratory issues and a small two year old son. He then said ""oh no I dont have it."" I continued to talk to this man because he just seemed like a lonely single dad who needed friends. we swapped phone numbers later and I went home and put my son down for a nap. He later facetimes me and tells me that he is covid positive and that he lied in order to talk to me. IM FREAKING OUT. Im only partially vaccinated and my son is so young. Im convinced Im going to die or my son will. Havent stopped sobbing all day. I know this is all my fault and I shouldve have just continued to stay home. I dont know what to do so if anyone has advice please help me. I would also like to say I only got vaccinated 5 days ago."
"I used fostair for 2-3 years and it worked perfectly, but then it started causing me paradoxical bronchospasm, so I switched to ventolin. I used it for almost a full year, and my asthma went back under control, but now, as I‚Äôm typing, it started causing me paradoxical bronchospasm as well. What the hell. 

Tomorrow or the following days I‚Äôll go to my doctor. In the meantime I‚Äôll continue hating my respiratory system"
"Reading this post it's amazing that medicine is premature when it comes to asthma.

  I went to 2 different pulmonologists who prescribed an inhaler, ensuring that methacholine cannot trigger something more serious.

  In addition to this post and several others that I found here on reddit about this substance, I am one more living proof that this methacholine is destroying lives.

  I've been short of breath for 50 days, exactly 50 days after the bronchial provocation test with methacholine. I've done the most varied types of exam and nothing was found."
"Hiii, I just wanna share. My father have asthma where it can trigger depending on the scent. But I don't if I inherited his genes. I have not yet gone through any check ups about this. During exercise I tend to stop what I am doing cause I feel like my heart is having a hard time to breathe, It also felt like a stabbing pain (while breathing) and squeezing feeling. It gets worse if I continue my exercise. Then I get headaches, nausea and coughing. Which lasts for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. I am not active exercising and I also gained weight. But during my athlete days, even if I am consistently doing exercise 3 times a week it also happen. So my concern is, do anyone of you who went to a checkup and confirmed that it is EIB with the same symptoms as mine?"
"Hello, 21F, had covid in late february. Just now i went to the store which is like 5mins away and i got some side ribcage sharp pains that didnt last long when i was near home. The pain was like when you run and have those muscle spasms in your shoulder if you know what i mean. My heart was beating really fast but thats because  im longhauling and still dont do well with exercise and i walked pretty fast(forgot to pace myself). When i came home i started feeling breathless when i felt my heart beating fast. I had to take deep breaths until i calmed down, my oxsat was 99% the whole time. It took me like 20mins of deep breathing to calm down. 

I read about exertion enduced asthma and wanted to see if you feel like this was it.

Note: i have a panic disorder which usually starts when i overexert myself because i feel like i wont be able to breathe and its part of ptsd from tachycardia attacks i got during acute infection. The fast heart beat wouldn't stop on its own without meds so now everytime it beats fast during normal activities like chores or walking i get scared thinking its tachycardia. I focus to much on my breathing and then cause panic from feeling like im not breathing enough when in reality im hyperventilating. 

I hope its not asthma, my question would be if it were, wouldn't it happen during any exercise? I dont get this after sex or when i enjoy a walk or just on days when i dont feel nervous.

Sorry for the long post, here's a ü•î for making it this far."
"I was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma.

Is it safe to use the inhaler daily before my run? Or are there negative side effects from using what is considered a rescue inhaler daily?"
"I'm an anxious human and it gives me tachycardia so I usually tend to avoid overdoing it. but I started running and the past few days have been hard at night, i get the usual wheezes and shortness of breath. Is two days in a row too much? I feel like my heart is going fast right now I can't imagine after the ventolin."
Anyone else experienced becoming ill shortly after their diagnosis? I've been diagnosed with asthma 2 months ago and I've been using the maintenance inhaler as prescribed and sometimes I'd have mild sore throat but nothing crazy. Unfortunately 2 days ago my throat became really sore and I've got increased temperature. I did rinse my mouth and gargle after use of the inhaler as prescribed; maybe I could've done a better job with it.
How has exercise improved your asthma? How long did it take before you noticed results?

"Hey everyone. I hope this is the right place to ask this, i honestly don't know where else to ask. So my husband takes fostair as a preventer inhaler, and it requires refrigeration before being dispensed. We're going through a fuel/economic crisis where I live so I had to get two fostairs in advance (not opened). We've been getting power cuts so i've been keeping the fostair in a cooler with frozen gel packs while the power is out. My question is, would the fostair spoil with all of this? And if it did somehow ""spoil"", would it be harmful or just lose its effectiveness? Thanks in advance to anyone who can give some answers."
Just wondering if allergy shots have actually noticeably improved anyone's asthma here. My pulmonologist pretty much said he hasn't seen results from them but I'd love for him to be wrong.

"I was diagnosed with mild asthma when I was 18. I have never been hospitalised but I get shortness of breath a few times a week. I have recently stopped smoking tobacco and weed after about 3 years of moderate to heavy use of both substances. To people like me who used to smoke with asthma but have now stopped, has your breathing improved? If so how long did it take and in what sort of way?"
"My pulmonologist‚Äôs schedule changed (fuck assholes who can‚Äôt get a damn vaccine or wear a fucking mask), and now the appointment I made in March is cancelled and I can‚Äôt see her for six months.

I had a major flare in July with 10 total days inpatient, BiPap, days spent with the nurse sitting outside my room working on her computer with the crash cart right there, it was bad. This was supposed to be my second appointment out of the hospital to check how the new meds I‚Äôm on (Nucala and Spiriva) are working.

They offered to schedule me with a PA or an NP, and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm comfortable with that. I know I‚Äôm complicated, I have a history with multiple admissions per year and several comorbidities, some of which are rare. I don‚Äôt particularly want to spend the appointment going over that history, being asked to do party tricks, or being told it‚Äôs all anxiety, and that‚Äôs a very real chance based on past experience with new providers.

I like my pulmonologist, but I am generally unhappy with the practice. Any other practice wouldn‚Äôt have admitting privileges at the hospital I will be taken to when I have my next bad flare, and would involve a significant amount of driving, and would have the same new provider issues. 

WWYD? Would you see a PA/NP for severe persistent asthma with three admissions in the last 12 months? Would you try to switch practices? Is there some other option I‚Äôm missing here?"
Hello! I recently been diagnosed for bipolar disorder and have been back on my inhaler since last year and have noticed it gives me alot of anxiety the day after or maybe even longer which is why I try to not take it unless I really have to......Those who have asthma and bipolar how is your experience with it affecting your medication/mood/routine?
"So I got sick with viral bronchitis at the end of June/beginning of July and was seen twice and told it should go away in 6 weeks. 

Well unfortunately, my immune system sucks and I got sick again with something about a week and a half ago. The cough never subsided anyways and is still lingering. I called the doctor and am taking prednisone  which usually helps but how the hell do I get all of this mucus up. Any tips or tricks?!"

"Hey guys. So during the last ~4 months or so I‚Äôve been suffering from a chronic cough that causes me to have horrible coughing fits. At first it started off as a tickle in the throat which caused me to have a coughing fit, which my doctor and I assumed was due to post nasal drip as I‚Äôve had allergies and sinus issues in the past (had sinus surgery in August of last year). So i was told to take Allegra during the day, Zyrtec at night, and 2 pumps of flonase twice a day.

After not having relief from that, I was started on an albuterol inhaler to see if that helped. It did for a little while so I was started on a steroid inhaler to take in addition to it as well as montelukast. This was around 7/15 of this year. I felt like my coughing had improved a couple of weeks ago but now I feel like I‚Äôm back to square one.

The past Wednesday I went in for PFT and was told that my lung capacity was within normal limits (88%) but my output of air showed that I‚Äôm trapping air in my lungs. The man who did the testing suggested I blow up a few balloons a day to help. When my doctor saw my results later on she said she‚Äôs not used to seeing it in someone my age and that she usually sees it in someone older who has been smoking for a large portion of their life. I have been smoking weed almost daily for the past 4 years (like half a bowl) but stopped once these issues got worse.

Does anyone have advise on how to navigate this? It‚Äôs been so frustrating trying to figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me and it‚Äôs been interfering with my sleep and work. Today I had ~3 coughing fits before 11 am, even after taking my albuterol inhaler around 7:30 am, and one fit was so bad it caused me to throw up. My doctor said she has to wait for the interpretation of my PFT before she changes up my meds and I have an appointment with her in 2.5 weeks. Does anyone hav any advice on what might help me in the meantime?

TLDR: Recently diagnosed with reactive airway disease (suspected asthma, waiting on PFT test interpretation). Taking multiple allergy meds and on Flovent and monteukast for almost 6 weeks. Still struggling with a chronic cough that‚Äôs making day-to-day life difficult. Any advice?"
"So today I was put on Alvesco 160mg (Ciclesonide) once daily by my pulmonologist for pretty mild asthma. However after inhaling a puff from my spacer, I noticed my breathing became more difficult and laborious.

I took some salbuterol, which did improve the breathing, but my lungs still felt pretty stiff. Called up my on-call GP and after a quick check-up, my saturation was 100% and my breathing was perfect. He did tell me he's heard of these kinds of reactions before, and he's warned me that I might wake up wheezing tonight.

I then realized I've had these reactions to steroids before. Be it inhaled steroids or Prednisone pills, I seem to get progressively more asthmatic as I continue their use. My allergist even ran some tests on me to see if I'm allergic to corticosteroids, but I'm not.

Nobody on Reddit seems to have had these issues though, I've searched around and only found references in the literature.

Anyone else had similar reactions?"
"I'm a swimmer in my junior year of high school. The season has just begun and I feel like such a failure for having to go into the lockeroom to get some air. Nobody else gets as exhausted as I do, and sometimes I feel like people think I'm faking it so I can get out of hard sets at practice. 

I try to tell myself it's the beginning of the season. And to give my lungs some time to catch up with the rest of my body. But honestly, I'm not so sure that will even happen. 

I would really appreciate some advice. I have exercise induced athsma btw."
Any help is appreciated
"What the fuck was Darwin thinking when he added a ""constricting lungs and restricting airflow"" charecteristic into humans?"
"My lungs seem to only be triggered by high humidity and it has been over 80% humidity for 3 days in a row now. I went without my maitienence puffer and rescue inhaler for over a week (which I probably shouldnt of done) because I thought I was better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today my rescue inhaler wasnt working so well so I got ride of the cartriage that was in it and put in a new one and it worked fine, the old one was all cleaned and everthing (its ventalin) but how do you tell when its empty if it feels like theres still stuff in it but the mist coming out could just be the aerosol spray and the medication is actually empty? Like do I have to put a piece of paper on the fridge and just use 1 tick for each dosage I use until it gets up to what ever is in the cartirage? Like 100 or 120 dose?"
"I've recently been diagnosed with asthma and have been getting a lot of relief from my blue inhaler (ventolin 100micrograms sabutamol sulfate). My doctor is now trying to get me off that onto a brown preventer (clenil modulite 100 beclometasone dipropionate). I've been on the brown one for two months and it doesn't seem to help at all even on double dose. 

Any suggestions what to try next? Is it possible that that particular steroid doesn't work for me and I should just try a different type? Obviously I will discuss with my doctor but just want an idea of my options before I talk to her. Thanks!"
"Really need some advice. My kid has asthma and is plagued with the cough. Currently on meds to control a flare up. I have been looking into either a humidifier or a dehumidifier but i really don't know what one is best. We are in the Uk so fairly normal temps. However my house is literally a 10 second walk to the sea. We are right next to it so i could say its coastal air. So would a humidifier be best for all year round rather than just when it's colder weather?
Any advice? Thanks in advance."
"Hey all,

I know that the overwhelming response to this would be to see a doctor, but thought I'd reach out to this community to at least see if this sounds like asthma and if any similar experiences have been had.

I had COVID in June (was single jabbed at the time) and it was all in all, a very mild affair. As it wound down, I found that a cough lingered and since then, I've become very ""wheezy"" at times. Most often in the middle of the night.

Last night for example I woke to find myself wheezing and coughing, for about 2 hours from 3:30am-5:30am. I eventually took an anti-histamine and afterwards I managed to get to sleep again. Anti-histamines seem to help, so dont know if its allergy induced or just placebo. 

Prior to COVID i'd never had any kind of experience like this (im 32 years old) - the closest thing being what appeared to be slight exercise induced asthma (tightness in chest after running). I might sneeze a bit in Summer due to pollen, but nothing breathing related and dust etc. never bothered me before. Never had to take antihistamines in my life before.

I never really feel a tightness in my chest or unable to breath during this, simply really loud audible wheezing that leads onto a bit of coughing - that then stops the wheezing for a minute and then cycle and repeat.

I've read that asthma can be 'triggered' in adults by viral infections etc. - is that possible with COVID, or has anyone experienced/herd of the same experience?"

"My menstrual cycle has been absolutely bonkers since starting all my asthma Rx in nearly July (newly diagnosed). So far have been on albuterol, prednisone, and now Advair.

Did it take you long to regulate?"
"Basically we've all been quarantining a bit, and our immune system has been not exposed to all the triggers it normally gets exposed to when going to school or work filled with 1000s of people and nature and what not?"
"When I was younger I used to have bad asthma attacks and extreme reactions to pollen in the spring, so I was prescribed Singular/Montelukast to help deal with it. While I was on it, I used to have vivid nightmares. I would wake up and feel like my room was as big as a warehouse, and would always have breakdowns crying in the middle of the night for no reason. My parents had no clue what it was. I was also always really short growing up and when I finally stopped taking it, I started to grow rapidly and I never had a nightmare again. If you are prescribed this please don't take it!!!!"
"I did a hike yesterday with about 4,000ft of elevation gain up to about 12,000ft. It was amazing but ever since I‚Äôve gotten down my chest has hurt and I feel like I‚Äôm having a hard time getting a full breath in. My SPO2 is 97% which is actually pretty high compared to my normal! I‚Äôm trying to decide whether I should use albuterol or just wait it out. Side note: I have sinusitis as well which causes a ton of mucus that unfortunately gets into my lungs, especially with heavy exercise. I *think* that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening but I‚Äôm just not 100% sure! That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm curious about the SPO2!

Thanks!"

"My partner (30yrs old) had an incredibly severe asthma attack in reaction to our 2 cats. They went into full status asthmaticus and ended up going into cardiac arrest as a result of the attack. I had to give them rescue breathing and CPR. Luckily they survived and are currently in acute rehab recovering. 

I now have the work of reducing allergens in the home as much as possible before they get home. 

Steps I‚Äôve already taken: 
1.	Getting way more serious about vacuuming. Vacuuming the furniture, vacuuming the ceilings, vacuuming carpets daily. 
2.	Going to be banning the cats from the bedroom 
3.	Increased bedroom ventilation 
4.	Added a second true HEPA filter to our better ventilated upstairs 
5.	Switched the cats to Purina LiveClear 
6.	Bought some allerpet and getting the cats used to being wiped down
7.	My partner will be compliant with Symbacort, previously was not due to cost
8.	Theyve agreed to give up smoking cigarettes 
9.	In addition to whatever meds they‚Äôll be prescribed I‚Äôm going to start making mullein tea for them daily to drink all day once they‚Äôre home. Ive already checked for indications. 

What am I missing? Am I deluding myself by thinking we‚Äôll be able to keep the cats and I should really be looking at rehoming? Any advice from folks living with cat allergies or who have recovered from a severe attack is welcome."

How often are you having to do a steroid burst to control your asthma? The past few years I'm up to 4x/yr and I'm not sure what's normal.

"Hello fellow asthmanauts I'm in a desperate need of a lifestyle change. My day to life has been miserable the past 8 months. I've become severely overweight combined with a new found addiction to marijuana and as a direct result my asthma is the worst its ever been. I've been having back to back attacks daily even when I'm at rest. This is causing me to slip into depression because I always feel terrible &amp; makes me feel so weak/little compared to who I used to be. I've decided I want to fight for my health and a better quality of life starting with quitting marijuana. What are some health tips to better my asthma from foods, workout styles, or just any tips you guys have learned along the way. I'm open to any reccomendations! Thanks for the replies in advance :)"
"I was wondering if it was normal to be nearly passing out due to asthma and chest tightness? I used to have to walk up a not very steep hill and 6 flights of stairs most days and when it was winter, with the cold triggering my asthma I was nearly passing out mid way or even at the top of the small hill alone every time. I'd take my inhaler but it would take a while to recover.

More recently I was walking down the street and my asthma was suddenly triggered unexpectedly and when its triggered it goes south very fast. One moment I was fine then my fingers and feet went cold and I was on the verge of passing out.

Is this a normal thing? Its always been there with my asthma and I had mentioned it to my asthma nurses years ago but they never really acted on it so I stopped mentioning it. 

I'm UK based if that helps anything and take my preventers every day as prescribed and take my reliever as needed.

TIA!"
"I‚Äôve recently had chest tightness with very slight ache/pain which i have had before when i haven‚Äôt been able to take my inhaler for a while but usually sorts itself out after a couple of days. 

For the last week or so it hasn‚Äôt shifted and have also got a sore throat- not covid as I‚Äôve been testing myself. 

Has anyone experienced this before or have any advice?"
"Sometimes when I run a bit faster than normal, or when I've not run in a while and start again I get this burning sensation in my lungs. Not during the exercise, not when I stop and get back up to my flat but a bit later, maybe in the shower or thereafter. There's no tightness, no wheezing, but a burning sensation and maybe a mild cough only when I exhale. It's like the burning you might get when there's a fire and you inhale smoke, but the other way around, when exhaling. I'd like to think that I'm on fire and I'm exhaling smoke, but that's of course silly."
So I think I am developing asthma but I can't be sure until I have tests but I'm wondering how is it tested for? I'm 20 currently and there's only been one person in my family to ever of had asthma that we know of.  Being autistic myself I usually tend to google etc but finding how it's tested for in a generic GP setting isn't a popular response that I can find anyway. Do they hook you to a machine or anything? I HATE having my t-shirt off which I think is what's giving me more anxiety honestly as that just ain't a good subject for me. I'm sure if it was the case they'd 100% understand but I'm very curious about how they test and how long it takes for them to be sure?

"I used to go jogging once/twice a week in the past but I never really got into it. Now that I want to improve my asthma and improve my body confidence along with less fatigue, I'm thinking I should take on tips for any advice you feel is important.

Also, which asthma pump should I be using before a run, brown or blue?"

"Anyone here who spent formative years being not being able to get in shape, and got diagnosed later? How was your experience and the effect on your general development?"
"I was diagnosed earlier this year, at 28.  I was tested numerous times in my childhood and did not show evidence of asthma.  

A few years ago, I worked in a setting where I was exposed to industrial chemicals which had instructions to wear a certain kind of mask but was expected to work without one.  I made multiple requests to use a mask to multiple supervisors, but was told that the store did not have masks and had no plans to purchase them.  

When working with the chemical, my lungs sometimes felt ""on fire,"" and I've had a persistent hacking cough since then which was not present beforehand.  Since then, I've had a lot of general pulmonary issues, leading to my testing and diagnosis this year.

Is it possible to bring on or sensitize asthma through use of outside factors?

Any help appreciated :)"
"I took emergen-c, mucinex, my inhaler.. I don‚Äôt want to go on prednisone again :( has anyone had similar issues and solved it themself?"
"Used to have asthma when I was really young never since 


But two weeks ago I started having moments where I basically have a hard time breathing 


So far there‚Äôs been 2 moments, both times I used my sisters inhaler and felt batter after like 30 minutes. The first time, after an hour I was like wow yeah I **definitley**feel a difference 


I‚Äôve been trying to ignore it but then I don‚Äôt think about it and suddenly feel like I can‚Äôt catch my breath and my chest gets this weird feeling 



How do I know if it‚Äôs in my head or not? It happens during random moments like yesterday was just at home chilling"
"I know I will probably be downvoted but I think it‚Äôs best to be truthful ,I‚Äôd there anyone else in this group that has asthma and takes a steroid inhaler who still smokes , I was only diagnosed with severe asthma or possible COPD yesterday but I still smoke , I‚Äôm trying to quit but it will take time , also does anyone else take Fostair 200/6 inhaler and have diabetes as well like myself as I‚Äôm worried about my inhaler making my blood sugar spike"
"And it works like magic. What I basically changed is that instead of using the single breath technique, I take 6 slow breaths in and out. I think one breath wasn't taking in all the medication. When I take my inhaler without a spacer, lot of it comes down to luck. Sometimes, the meds hit my throat and not my lungs, but with a spacer, there's no luck factor. Also, with this multiple breath technique, no need to hold my breath. It's much more simpler."

"Hey all, new to asthma, and was prescribed a steroid inhaler 1.5 weeks ago for persistent asthma that never goes away. How am I supposed to be feeling at this point? 

There‚Äôs definitely been some improvement, but I still feel like there‚Äôs some way to go before I get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Do you have some days which feel better than others? I know the trend is overall supposed to be up, but there are days when I question whether the dosage is enough for a full recovery.

Also would inhaled budesonide affect the effectiveness of the vaccine?"
"Hello! I'm currently 15 years old and have had trouble breathing for a while now. 
(This is a long story, sorry.)

A bit of a backstory:
I've always had issues with breathing, but I kind of just ignored my symptoms because I figured that they were linked to colds and allergies. Before Covid hit, and even before the mask mandates, I used to get sick maybe once every month. Somewhere at the start of the month (or midway), I would catch a cold. This cold would turn into a long, persistent cough that wouldn't go away for the life of me (along with congestion). I remember precisely that my cough would be phlegmy for a bit, but would subside into a dry, wheezy, and nagging cough. This became the norm. I would catch a cold, have it develop into something making it last longer (for the duration of the month), and then end up with a cough that would not go away, even after I was pretty sure I was done being sick. Then after like a two week break maybe, I'd get sick again, and they cycle would continue.

Since then I haven't had a cold in nearly two years (I think because of the masks, and I was out of school for 2 years for online learning). I can't remember much about my symptoms back then, other than that stupid cough with a wheeze, my chest feeling constricted, and being sick for far longer than anyone should be - especially for a common cold. 

Now, I've recently started taking notice of my daily symptoms over the duration of 2-3 months. 
-Itchy, watery and irritated eyes (although they're itchy and watery 24/7, regardless of the season)
-Postnasal drip, congestion (24 hours day/night)
-sneezing mainly during spring/summer
-Shortness of breath (During exercise &amp; laughing - ends with a coughing fit, walking for prolonged periods of time, before bed, walking up stairs, etc.). Issues with getting air into my lungs - feels like there's a cap to how much air my lungs will let me take in, rather than getting the air out (although I do have struggles getting air out, too).
-Chest tightness when I'm around triggers such as smoke, really hot and dry air, cold and wet air, etc. Feels like a rubber band is around my lungs.
-Wheezing (inhaling and exhaling, mostly exhaling), with a dry cough every morning and every night, a couple times around noon.

For clarification, I do go to the doctor the 27th of August. Although I'm not exactly sure how I should bring up these symptoms to her (should I just tell her exactly this?), and what to expect when I do tell her. If you have any advice, please share. I do apologize for how long this explanation was, but I figured it might be helpful for you guys to know some details, and whether they'd be relevant to the situation or not. They're there just in case.

Thank you for reading :)"

"My wife is severely immunocompromised due to many years of high dose steroids to control her asthma. I give her a Xolair injection every other week, and a nurse comes to the house once per month for an IVIG infusion to give her a temporary boost to her immune system.

Because of all this her immunologist has recommended she get a 3rd dose. We both received 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech back in March. She is getting her 3rd dose on Monday.

Long story short I got new AC system in my home today. On this one I can set humidity levels. I I searched for good humidity levels for asthma and it says between 30 and 50%. I live in Florida and those are very low humidity levels for us. My question is do you do better in lower humidity or higher humidity? I don't mind the humidity being higher because I'm really used to it but maybe I've been sabotaging myself for the past 2 years?

"Hi all, 

Hoping to get some input from folks who‚Äôve experienced asthma attacks, so I figured I‚Äôd shoot my shot here. 

Note: I am not asking this in place of a professional opinion. I have an appointment for allergy testing next week!

Long story short, last night I was out to dinner and experienced what I assumed to be an allergic reaction to something I ate. My main symptom was a persistent, mucus-y cough (gross, sorry) that didn‚Äôt subside for at least an hour. It was like I had the persistent urge to cough constantly. I never felt the sensation that my throat was closing or that I couldn‚Äôt breathe exactly, but I definitely felt a bit wheezy due to the mucus I could feel. I also felt itchy under my chin. I popped a few Benadryl because I assumed I was allergic to something. But upon doing some reading, it almost seems like what I experienced was closer to an asthma attack. So I guess my question is: does anyone have experience with differentiating an allergic reaction to an asthma attack? 

Any input appreciated. Thanks y‚Äôall, stay safe"
"This past year has been a difficult one for everyone, I always had asthma but my allergies have been getting worse (I am allergic to everything) and it's been hard to find a way to manage it. 
After putting up enough with letting fear control me, I'm starting out group classes at a gym called Orange Theory. I need to put my health first, but the past few times I worked out I think I just pushed myself too hard, and I ended up in the ER two times.
I'm on singular, and my doctor JUST put me on a controller a couple days ago, and I of course have the rescue inhaler as well. 
I am just wondering if anyone else had a fear of triggering asthma?"
"I am having bad bout of cough variant asthma. Which is exclusively triggered after getting a cold or sore throat. Mine usually last about a month of coughing, sometimes longer. Previously when I wasnt able to cope or get it in control, the coughing used to produce blood because of hacking cough continuosly. Been to pulmonologist and the ct scan always comes clear and xray as well. 

Is there a weekly injection that I can take in a doctors office which can counter this kind of asthma. I have heard of allergy shots but mine is induced by viral cold/sore throat. And after it starts have to walk around with cough drops and cold air tends especially air conditioner makes it worse.

This all started when i had a bad bout of bronchitis after which was diagnosed with late onset asthma."
"EDIT: I understand that, currently, there is no cure, and so, we can only manage its symptoms. But I am fairly optimistic that something resembling a cure will come in the future, with all the advances in science and also taking in consideration the enormous amounts of resources that are being channeled to respiratory disease treatments due to COVID. Are there other optimistic people like me in this community?"
Hi guys! I'd like to know if it's safe for two asthma patients to get married. What are the negative effects of this? I know for sure it's hereditary but I need some more education on this topic. Thank you.

I‚Äôm currently in the SF area and although we aren‚Äôt too close my lungs are feeling it. I was outside today for a few hours and when I came home I immediately ran to my rescue inhaler. It makes me so anxious for what‚Äôs to come because last years fire season was BAD for me. Any suggestions or tips on how to stay semi sane/ how to help my asthma through this time. Anything helps!!
"Im 22, 5‚Äù7, 230 lbs (last i checked), and have asthma (thank god, not severe). I live in a two story house with my boyfriend, and even going up and down the stairs causes my heart to feel like its going to explode- sorry if i sound stupid, but im not used to exercise, so idk if thats normal or not. Im trying to lose weight by eating better but since i have a history of eating disorders, it‚Äôs difficult for me- i used to have bulimia, but now i feel i have an overeating disorder which i am doing my hardest to fight.

Whenever i exercise for even 10 minutes i feel, again, like my heart is going to explode, and its really bothering me. Not to be morbid, but i dont want to die before i have a family. Or at all, even.

Does anyone else have this issue with their heart or am i legit just overreacting? I have a tendency to overreact but thats just bc how my grandma raised me.. and honestly anything involving my heart scares the shit out of me, even if its a tiny second of pain that meant nothing.

Also, are there any workouts i could do at home that you could recommend? When i moved out i lost my treadmill since it belongs to my family, but i enjoyed going on it at slow-medium speed.

Thank you"
"I have EDS and fibro with some still undetermined problems. 

Does anyone else have their asthma trigger off bad when you are also having a run down /flare up day or extremely fatigued?

Apart from some normal little triggers the only one that‚Äôs consistent is when my body is run down my breathing follows. I mean it kinda makes sense since my body is sluggish but wondered if anyone else gets the same triggers ?? 
Because with certain triggers you can mostly avoid them but I can‚Äôt avoid flare up days so not sure how to aid it I guess"
"I‚Äôm getting my first dose of Dupixent soon for my asthma (I have allergies and elevated eosinophil levels). I know there have been threads before, but I wanted to add more experiences to the mix and was wondering how this treatment worked for your asthma/nasal congestion. Any side effects? Time it took to notice differences? Able to exercise again/not get winded easily? Etc?"


"I had mild/moderate asthma, until I got COVID-19. I am a long haul patient that now has severe asthma. I need nebulizer treatments through out each day now in addition to corticosteroids and bronchiole dilators, and have had countless sleepless nights fighting this.

My niece just got me sick with a cold, and the chest congestion was making my asthma worse tonight and I was anticipating a serious lack of sleep tonight fighting it. 

I have done a lot of trigger point therapy for sports injuries, and thought I would look to see if there was something that might help asthma. I stumbled upon this link: 

[asthma trigger points](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/home-remedies/press-these-5-acupressure-points-to-get-relief-from-asthma/articleshow/70948357.cms)

I started with the chest points and I cannot believe the difference it made. I am so excited because I feel like I can actually fall asleep comfortably. I figured I would share in case anyone else can find relief from it. I would be interested to hearing feedback!

P.S. I have seen multiple pulmonologist, immunologists, and been to long haul covid clinics. If anyone has questions about how covid works or how it impacts asthma feel free to reach out. I have gathered a lot of information from doctors that I found is not circulating around the general public. I would be happy to share with anyone suffering from the virus in any way I can."
"From:  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html

""Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress your immune response""

Anyone know if this is referring to inhaled corticosteroids like advair or just oral steroids like prednisone? I'd assume the latter but it's not clear to me"
"Has anybody of you tried (with their doctors or not), mixing preventive inhalators for a greater response? Like taking budesonide in the morning and fluconazole in the night?"
"I play college soccer which obviously takes a lot of running, and recently every-time i run i get a sharp pain in the right side of my chest that progressively gets worse as i run more. I already went to the doctor and was cleared so i don‚Äôt really know what to do, using my inhaler doesn‚Äôt work, and it‚Äôs frustrating because it doesn‚Äôt allow me to play. Any help would be appreciated."
"Hi everyone! I am kind of just looking to see if others can relate. I‚Äôm 28 and have had bad asthma since I was an infant. Currently I take daily symbicort, montelukast, and monthly Xolair (Omalizumab) injections just to keep me controlled enough. Even with that, I still notice my asthma symptoms daily and just had an emergency room trip where I was prescribed a short course of prednisone and a lot of salbutamol. What I‚Äôm struggling with is that I‚Äôve found that people in my personal life just do not seem to take my illness seriously. I feel like because asthma is a relatively common disease, people tend to brush it off as nothing because I don‚Äôt think they really realize the different levels of severity of the disease. It gets frustrating for me because the lack of concern and understanding makes ME feel bad if I cancel plans or have limitations at work due to my breathing. Honestly just wondering if anyone else experiences this because it‚Äôs starting to become so tiring. I think too it‚Äôs because I am still pretty young and look healthy, people just can‚Äôt understand that I am sick. I am not sure why, but it‚Äôs wearing on me."
"i‚Äôve been short of breath constantly for just over a week now, i told the doctor and he‚Äôs going to treat me for asthma, i‚Äôm getting my inhalers tomorrow 

if it is asthma is there something i can do to relive the shortness of breath before i get my inhalers?"
"I [26F] was recently diagnosed with adult asthma. Out of the blue, I started having chest tightness, chest pain, and shortness of breath since the beginning of this month. It‚Äôs unclear what the trigger is at this time, but it‚Äôs likely allergy-driven since my recent allergy results showed that I‚Äôm allergic to a lot of things. I also had no clue that I had allergies, so all of this is new to me.

My allergist prescribed albuterol as a rescue inhaler and Advair as a daily inhaler. I started off with the 250 dosage to control the asthma, since I was having daily symptoms. I have been on Advair for a week. I haven‚Äôt noticed any improvements yet, but I immediately starting having sleeping issues due to heart palpitations that wake me up as I fall asleep. I‚Äôm normally super quick to fall asleep at night, and rarely have issues, but ever since I started taking Advair, the heart skipping wakes me up at least 4-5 times before I fall asleep. No issues breathing once I‚Äôm fully asleep though. No history of anxiety.

I stopped taking the nightly puff of Advair 250 and only took the morning dose, and the sleeping issues went away immediately. My allergist called in a lower dosage of Advair 100 to see if my heart tolerates it better. 

I‚Äôm still having asthma symptoms daily, typically only in the afternoon and evening time. Not sure how long it takes Advair to kick in, but I‚Äôve still had to use albuterol a few times since I started. Breathing exercises do help though.

Has anyone experienced something similar before? Any insight is appreciated!"
"Hi Everyone,

The last year my breathing has gotten really bad. If I'm sitting, it feels like I have to work hard just to breathe. Usually, this only happens if I get a cold but this past year, it's happened a few times so my doctor had me do a pulmonary function test. 

 The pulmonologist read it as asthma + mild COPD since my FVC and FEV1 were reduced along with the FEV1/FEV ratio being 70% -- (and 70% of my predicted function). When I had the test done, I could see the results and the did it pre- and post- inhaler but my results never changed after using an inhaler (bronchodilators). The person giving the test said my lung valves looks clear but my function is lower than it should be. 

My GP is booking me a 2nd level test (I live in Canada so it's probably going to take a few months -- as it took 6 months to get this one test). She said my results showed mild to moderate restriction.

My grandma had COPD and was never a smoker. I also have had pneumonia really bad in high school where I had to miss a month of school and then bronchitis a couple of times since then. Now when I get a cold, my main symptom is having a hard time breathing. 

I'm not sure what any of this means, if it's asthma or COPD but I'm very confused trying to interpret my results."

"Hello all, I had my first pulmonary function test on Monday and since my throat feels dry and strained. Is this normal afterwards or yet another medical thing to be worried about?"
What it says on the tin...my inhaler went on a bit of a ride through the washer on permanent press in my work pants...is it still ok to use?
"Hi, just looking some advice. I recieved my 3rd dose of Nucala to treat Severe Asthma yesterday and after a shower this morning i noticed a small red prickly rash around the base of my neck/shoulders. There's no pain/itch or swelling and it's just in this one area, but i'm just wondering is this is something that anyone has encountered before?

I'm keeping and eye on it and will contact the clinic if it gets worse."
"I‚Äôve had asthma since childhood, 50 now. I used to think I just had environmental triggers (animals, dust), but the past few years, I use rescue inhaler several times daily even with no apparent triggers. Starting to try food elimination diets. Also noticed that my breathing seems to get worse at night, I need my inhaler more in the morning then during the day on a typical day.
Any ideas why it would be worse at night? I can‚Äôt think of anything in my bedroom or a bed that would bother me."
"I‚Äôm really new to having asthma (or at least having it diagnosed‚Ä¶ I dunno??) and I‚Äôve been told to use my Advair during flairs/when I have bronchitis but am I supposed to be taking something daily? Things I read say that I should but my dr hasn‚Äôt prescribed anything.

 I was diagnosed last year after having Covid. I‚Äôve only been told to use the advair for two weeks when i was first diagnosed, then told again 2 weeks ago to use it for a month because I have bronchitis. 
I also have albuterol which I‚Äôve been told to use ‚Äúduring emergencies‚Äù but I really don‚Äôt know what that means? I‚Äôve had nebulizers in the past when I had pneumonia or low O2 sat but I don‚Äôt know how to know when to use it at home. 

I‚Äôm just confused I guess. Am I supposed to be taking something daily or not?"
"So backstory-I (31F) experienced exercise induce asthma back in April. I started running again after an 8 month hiatus and towards the end I was wheezing like crazy and having trouble breathing. The day after that incident, I started feeling better so I just figured it was cause my body wasn‚Äôt used to running. 

Then at the end of May, I had a 3 hour long allergy attack (I assume that‚Äôs what it was?) out of nowhere I started coughing, sneezing, runny + stuffy nose. Ever since then I‚Äôve been wheezing and coughing consistently. After a month of trying to ignore it, the symptoms got to be too much so I had my PCP prescribe an albuterol inhaler. At first I was using it twice a day, then I started needing it 4+ times per day. Mid-July I went to the ER where they gave me an x-ray which was clear but the doctor said my lungs sounded really bad and she was sure I have adult onset asthma. I started a 5 day course of  prednisone, then followed up with PCP on day 4. He told me my lungs still sounded bad so he had me do an additional 10 day course of prednisone. It worked and after 15 days I was finally not wheezing and could breathe like normal. 

It‚Äôs now been 3 weeks since I stopped the steroids and I feel awful. The past 4 days I‚Äôve needed my inhaler AT LEAST every 3 hours, around the clock, even though I know I‚Äôm only supposed to use it every 4 at most. I start coughing and wheezing 2.5 hours after using the inhaler, like clockwork. I hold off as long as I can but it‚Äôs not pleasant. I called my PCP yesterday and he told me he will put a referral in to pulmonology and I‚Äôll be calling them tomorrow to see how quickly they can get me in. 

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some insight-maybe someone had a situation somewhat similar to mine? Any advice or tip on managing while I wait to be seen?"
"Before, I only had to take two puffs of a preventer at night, and that was fine because nighttime was either way a dark and depressing time, and it was great and dandy.

However, now that I have to take my inhaler first thing when I wake up as well, it's so depressing. I feel its a terrible way to start my brand new day, by taking my inhaler, and remembering how shitty how lungs are as the first thing you do in the morning.

I know, I know, first world problems."
"Been taking Breo for a week, and my back muscles are extremely sore. Is this because of the Breo? Has it had enough time to actually cause this? Has anyone else experienced this?"

thanks
"hi all‚ÄîI‚Äôve (24f) never posted here before but wanted to try after the experience I just had. last saturday i attempted to get my flovent refill before going out of town; cvs had a weird hold on it so i just left without it. since coming back to LA and waiting to get it filled my asthma became super inflamed to the point where neither my albuterol inhaler or levalbuterol nebulizer brought much relief. my breathing pretty much just stayed restricted and uncomfortable but didn‚Äôt get to the point where i would‚Äôve gone to the hospital in the past. last night i could only sleep an hour at a time since i would wake up not breathing, and worried that i wouldn‚Äôt get my flovent in time (scheduled to be delivered tomorrow) i had a telehealth appt this morning prescribe me prednisone which i immediately went out and got filled. i feel so much better after taking my first dose and got some relief from my inhaler that i feel will be further helped when i get my flovent but i just wonder‚Ä¶ has being on flovent/advair preventatives for so long (probably over 10 years) directly worsened my asthma to the point that going without it for a period of time makes it almost debilitating? or is it just a natural combo of factors (poor air quality where i live, just getting older, etc)? i just wondered if anyone had advice or could relate, thanks for listening folks"
"Hi,

I've been prescribed the Budesonide preventive steroid inhaler, which I take in the morning and evening. After about a weeks time, I noticed improved breathing, which is great - but since day one of using the preventive inhaler, I've been feeling a general feeling of discomfort and irritability. Nothing major, but definitely noticeable, and it stagnates my mood. Has anyone else experienced this when starting a preventive inhaler? Is this normal and will eventually get better once I get used to it, or am I having a bad reaction? I've already scheduled an appointment with my doctor to talk this through, but was just generally curious if anyone else has experienced this.

Thanks."
"At 50, for the first time in my life I was diagnosed with having symptoms consistent Asthma.   This was several months ago.  Yesterday, I discovered that due to a screwup by the local Plummer, water had been leaking into the basement and causing significant mold to grow over the past 6 months.  I'm beginning to think that I don't have Asthma and the real problem all along has been the mold. 

Has anyone had similar experiences?"
"Finally saw specialist who looked at all my scans and listened to my symptoms and instantly knew it‚Äôs VCD. I‚Äôm booked in to see an ENT but the earliest appointment they could give me is in November.

I‚Äôm hoping there are some people out there on this forum who experience asthma and VCD who could give me some tips for things to do at home to help my symptoms until I can start a better treatment? I‚Äôll see my regular GP and chat to her on Friday about it but any advice from anyone going through this would be greatly appreciated.

It‚Äôs very bad at the moment - I‚Äôm really struggling to breathe and can‚Äôt walk long distances so I‚Äôm stuck on my couch/in bed most of the time. I can‚Äôt speak a lot because I run out of breath, and of course short of breath makes my heart work harder which gives me the shakes and makes me very light headed. I feel this will be my new normal until November. I‚Äôm quite scared, and very upset but also I know it‚Äôs treatable and I know I‚Äôll be okay I just need to make it these next few months without totally
losing my mind."
"Polls aren‚Äôt allowed in this sub. So I have to resort to using a text post

Childhood asthma?

Or

Adult Onset asthma?"
"I am a 19 year old male with no history of Asthma. I had contracted covid in April 2021... My symptoms were mild and only had loss of sense and taste. Since then I have never felt like my previous self.

It's more than 4 months and I still find myself wheezing sometimes, Idk the actual trigger... Sometimes It happens after eating, other times it happens when I lay down on bed. I don't particularly feel shortness of breath but this wheezing just won't go. 

I have consulted 2-3 doctors but all my reports including ECG came back normal... Doctors just say it's normal. The last doctor suggested I had anxiety which was causing all this, but I just don't get how anxiety can cause wheezing.

I am completely normal for a week or two and suddenly this 3-4 days phase comes when the wheezing is back. 

Any idea what's going on ?"
"I was diagnosed with cold-induced asthma several years ago. I know it‚Äôs not as bad as a lot of people in here, but It‚Äôs really awful getting a cold/flu and being sick for weeks and weeks because the asthma flare-up.

I recently caught a bug from my daughter, it was really mild for the first few days but it‚Äôs ramped up intensely now and I‚Äôm having a full-blown asthma flare-up. I immediately started using my pulmicort inhaler (Budesonide) as soon as I felt I was getting sick, and just started taking singulair at night, mostly because I forgot.

Just wondering for others with similar asthma as mine what their action plan is, and if they are ever successful not getting asthma after contracting a cold/flu. 

Thanks,"
"I'm 16, and I used to have pretty mild asthma - when I got colds, I'd usually need the neb, but other than that, no issues (minus running). Then I got whooping cough about a year ago, and I have moderate to severe asthma that's not technically asthma but still requires an inhaler and nebs.

Anyway. In my science class, we were working with clay dust. We were expressly told not to inhale it, but my teammate and I were idiots and we're patting the dust and making clouds that I inhaled. It didn't take long for me to start coughing my goddamned lungs up, and I got sent home. This was at 9:30 this morning, and it's now 7:30, and I'm still miserable. I can't breathe, I can't swallow because my throat hurts, I cough so much, my chest is killing me. I went to urgent care at 3, didn't get seen till 5, and they prescribed Prednisone. Yay, since that always clears this stuff up for me.

But wait! Every Walgreens in my area is out of stock until tomorrow! So I'll be miserable tonight and tomorrow! Gah.

Apparently the clay I inhaled is causing an allergic reaction, which is aggravating my asthma. So three weeks into school, after already missing the first two days due to an asthma attack, and I'm out for another two days. I just want to be in-person for one friggin' year. God."
"And thus, inhalers should be dirt cheap, if not free, for all. Sorry for the political post lol."
"I have asthma that is mostly exervise induced. There are some other triggers as well, pollen, smoke etc but exercise is far the worst trigger. I've been taking budesonide inhalation powders for about 6 months which helped a lot during the day but exercise still gave me the same trouble so I was told to use my rescue inhaler (ventolin) before exercise. Now I also started taking montelukast about a month ago which seems to be good for the exercise induced symptoms, meaning I don't need to take my rescue inhaler most of the time, but I am experiencing a lot of lung pain instead from exercise, mostly from cardio. The feeling is similar to what I imagine it would feel like to have the skin peeled off your lungs and washing it with salt water which is especially painful when breathing in.. does anyone else experience this or does anyone know what the cause could be?"
"So I‚Äôm needing some help right now. I‚Äôve been born with asthma my whole life but this year has been the worst for my lungs I wheeze, it sounds like pop rocks sometimes and I just can‚Äôt stop coughing. I do vape and smoke weed yes i know i‚Äôm dumb. but i need some help trying to quit vaping so my lungs can get better. any advice?"
"I‚Äôm 17 , when I was younger I apparently had asthma but it was pretty weak if I recall as I only needed to inhale this medicine or gas( not sure what it was) from this little penguin with a mouth tube. I‚Äôve not needed to use that since and been asthma free but only recently I noticed my chest feeling mildly tight and when I breath I can breath pretty easily but it kinda feels like I need to take a deeper breath and I do and sometimes it takes a few breathes to get it .

It‚Äôs hard to explain so my apologies if you don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm trying to say . I‚Äôve felt like that only recently and it wasn‚Äôt anything sever at all and it was just slightly annoying , when I run I feel fine but my lungs give out before my legs do so I wonder if that‚Äôs something I should worry about or if I‚Äôm just not used to running , after I get done running sometimes I cough and have a very slight wheeze if I inhale 2 much but that‚Äôs when I push myself hard when running .
(haven‚Äôt had that in a while when I run but I‚Äôve had very mild coughs after which end in like 5 mins or less) 
Yesterday I feel like I‚Äôve gotten worse , when I inhale deeply and get a good thing of air then exhale I hear a very slight whistle sound (only when I exhale after inhaling a lot of oxygen by looking my head up and inhaling as I was told that helps increase air intake)  I‚Äôve never had that before or at least I‚Äôve never noticed it which worries me .

Today I did the fitness gram pacer test at school and I pushed my self and the only thing holding me back was me being out of breath but I feel like that‚Äôs just me not being experienced with running , I felt fine but I did feel like I was breathing heavier then others although I could just be overthinking it and paranoid since the speaker is playing and their breaths probably can‚Äôt even be heard by me . While running my lungs felt
Like they were very mildly burning , not painful or to the point where it made me want to stop but it felt like I was working out a muscle . After it took like a minute or 2 to slow down my breathing and I was gasping for air but I out of breath . Around 10 mins go by and I don‚Äôt feel like I need to cough.

Edit: I felt a small tingle in my throat , easily ignorable but if I cough it was a very small wheeze cough (a single cough ) and I think it was because of the way I projected my air out when I coughed . I stood up coughed again to see if I wheezed and it was just a allergy type of cough with I‚Äôm 17 ,

After that I didn‚Äôt cough at all and I just had to clear my throat like a couple of times and what I mean by that is you know how people say ‚Äúexcuse me ‚Äú when trying to get someone attention then they make a throat sound (clearing your throat)

Things I‚Äôve noticed: 
when I stand it‚Äôs easier to get a better air intake but I can breath and feel ok when sitting .
 
When yawning it sometimes is hard to get that satisfying air intake 


I don‚Äôt want to go to the doctor because if I get diagnosed with asthma my dream career will be eliminated since I won‚Äôt be able to qualify . It might just be in my head and I might be worsening it with anxiety and stress but it sucks cuz I never felt like this before and it just came out of nowhere around when I was working pushing chopping carts . 
Since this started I‚Äôve never felt like I was going to die or been gasping for air all I‚Äôve felt was annoyances and sometimes slight difficulty breathing or getting a satisfying /good air brake or at least it doesn‚Äôt feel like a good air intake . 

Sorry for such a long message but I could use some advice and help and hopefully I don‚Äôt have Asthma . 

Thanks"
"About 5-10 mins prior I was feeling dizzy and overheated. I told my fiancee I wanted to take a shower. He said he wanted to take one as well. When I got in the water it felt nice at first but my back was aching and my stomach and my chest. My lungs felt tight like they were constricted and it started getting really hard to breathe my fiancee started trying to ask me what was wrong but I was having a hard time speaking cuz I was too focused on trying to breathe. I was breathing heavily but no matter how hard I was breathing it felt like it still wasnt enough. My throat felt cold and dry. My hands and feet went numb and the tingling numbness traveled up to my limbs. I felt like I was going to fall over. I sat down in the tub and my fiancee turned off the shower. I tried to straighten my spine so that I wasnt putting any extra pressure on my lungs. I felt like my throat was closing and i felt a tingling sensation in my left lung and sternum. My fiancee suggested we go outside so I could get some fresh air. I was scared to walk because my limbs felt shakey. Somehow I made it into our backyard with my towel and I continued wheezing and gasping for air for like 10mins before I started feeling the pressure on my lungs easing up. I kept telling myself not to panic and to try taking deep breaths and holding them in for a few seconds at a time.

I have a family member who has asthma so I dont know if its hereditary. I dont know if i had an asthma attack or a panic attack or what that was. But I am just scared and want to know if anyone has had a similar experience and what it ended up being caused by.

Thank you"
"I live in Kemerovo, Kuzbass, Siberia. Last 10 yrs winters was not so cold, -30 c maximum
But previous year it was -40 c and higher, and I had asthma attacks every time I go out from home, so I guess I need to know any suggestions how to work with that, ladies and gentlemen?"
"However, with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids ( max dose of Asmanex HFA), my asthma is completely surpressed.

According to University of Michigan : [uofmhealth.org/health-library/hw161158](https://uofmhealth.org/health-library/hw161158) :

I have severe persistent asthma, because without treatment, not only would I not be able to do anything, I would eventually die.

Would you agree I have severe persistent asthma? I thought severe asthma meant you were on Xolair or something."
Can you help me interpret these? I can provide context via reply if I have left anything pertinent out. https://i.imgur.com/CbbWILq.jpg

"Hi, a bit ago on this subreddit, I saw someone advertise their product for asthmatics called Filter.  I signed up for it, because I love data, and I recently received my Filter.  

Did anyone else sign up for it?  Has anyone started using it?"
I really thought my asthma was under control since my last major flair up was about four years ago but on Saturday someone wearing a cloud of cologne set off my asthma so bad that I'm still feeling a little wheezy. I semi-frequently have mild flair ups where I might need a puff off my inhaler but it's not been like this for awhile. My PCP recommended starting me on a daily preventative (Beclomethasone Diprop) and a week of prednisone and I'm honestly feeling kind of defeated. It's pretty depressing to go from strenuous hikes and consistent long distance runs less than a week ago to feeling out of breath after walking for just a few minutes. I know that this kind of stuff happens and this feeling is temporary but I can't help but feel down about it. How do you guys cope with situations like this?
"So two times before today, I had a mild asthma attack while eating chicken noodle soup. I thought it was just a coincidence. I thought maybe it was something in the kitchen. 

Nope! Today I had another asthma attack while eating chicken noodle soup. My mom suggested that it could be the heat and steam from the soup. I used my inhaler and continued eating my soup (I shouldn't have but I really like soup.)

Unfortunately, that was when my body decided it was a good idea to make me have a coughing fit. My throat feels raw and I had to change clothes because there was chicken broth all over them. 

Has anyone else had something similar happen with any kind of hot liquid?"
"I'm taking Asmanex HFA 200 mcg 2 puffs twice a day, and so since I'm taking such a high dose, do I risk lots of it being absorbed in my bloodstream and producing systemic side effects, basically just like prednisone?"
"Hi everyone!! I‚Äôm relatively new to running, I‚Äôve always been a swimmer and since retirement, have been trying to get into running. I‚Äôve noticed that any time I‚Äôm running and there‚Äôs low humidity, or the temperature is under 70 degrees (i know, not even cold), I get this aching in my trachea with every breath. I feel like I don‚Äôt get air as well, and my muscles fatigue really easily. I also cough after running in colder weather, but thought it was just post nasal drip. Also, when I go into really cold weather, not even in exertion, I feel like I cannot get any air at all, it‚Äôs like it was sucked out of me, and I can only cough. I kind of thought this was normal, but read a post from someone with exercise induced asthma and realized that I relate to their experiences. I know asking reddit is not a substitution to seeing a doctor, but was just wondering if this is something normal or not before I go and spend time and money to see a doctor. Thanks guys!!!"
"My mum and brother have asthma diagnoses but they don‚Äôt need inhalers to live and don‚Äôt have attacks or wheeze they just get out of breathe really easily and can‚Äôt breathe like they‚Äôve been in a marathon. 

I think o have asthma too but it‚Äôs different. The inhaler helps but i can still breathe without it just really shallow and it hurts my chest/throat. Like my sternum is being pushed down and crushing my lungs. And my throat feels like it‚Äôs closing up and I can‚Äôt breathe deep. And if I can it feels like I‚Äôm not getting enough air. 

I have anxiety and also a really small airway and sinuses so maybe I just can‚Äôt get enough air from that?"
"Hi, 
The last few times I‚Äôve worked out doing cardio I haven‚Äôt been able to get my heart rate between 100-114. It averages about 114 actually. 

I was on the bike yesterday before yesterday I was on the elliptical machine. I used to get up to 120-130 no problem. It‚Äôs a little harder each time to get my heart rate up. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my asthma or if it‚Äôs because I can breathe better and need to push harder longer or need to add more resistance or if it‚Äôs related to my thyroid issues. 

My resting hr is 68 and my spo is 99. This is huge, I mean freaking huge where as in the past my spo was always around 89, 90. 

I‚Äôve been on an anti-inflammatory diet for almost two years. I still slip up I‚Äôm not perfect but it‚Äôs still huge. I also have been trying to wean off of the steroid inhaler so I keep exercising. 

I‚Äôm still very phlegmy and I don‚Äôt think that will ever go away. Well it goes away when I‚Äôm on steroids and antibiotics but I‚Äôve digressed. 

I want to get my heart rate up so I can burn more fat. Any ideas?"
"Hi all,

The past month has been pretty awful with my asthma, my anxiety plays off of it as well. so if my asthma gets bad so does my anxiety, the other way also happens when my anxiety gets bad so does my asthma.

Recently I've just been feeling like I can't breathe in enough air, even though I can still breathe in, I think it might be just worrying causing me to stress more which in turn is causing my breathing to be worse :( 

I joined the gym 10/11 days ago (after talking with my asthma nurse), been gym 3x, and swimming once.

I know starting to exercise and eating healthy won't make any overnight quick changes, I know it takes a couple of months... I need some motivation from you guys who have had bad asthma, what kind of exercises, sports, activities helped your asthma? 

I'm on Symbicort 100/6 (which I take as my preventative (2x morning and 2x night) and also as my reliever (up to 4x a day, so 8  in total). I'm 23, male, otherwise healthy."

"Alright everyone, i wanted to tell somebody this and thought ""why not share this on Reddit?""

&amp;#x200B;

I have had asthma ever since i was a chubby kid growing up,it always bothered me, the worst was when i would laugh too hard my asthma would react terribly.

I am 32 years old now and have not walked around with a inhaler for a year and a half 

I started Running before covid, when covid hit i stopped running until i decided to start running but i would go with a face mask on, so i am not breaking any laws.

Low and behold i have been running with a mask on for 3 months (i dont anymore). My asthma stopped bothering me i thought it was too good to be true but i went hiking, very intense and still nothing.

i highly suggest someone tries this because i am curious if the same result will happen to them.

TL;DR  Runnng with a face mask on healed my asthma"
"I‚Äôve been in and out of A&amp;E been admitted and shit, yesterday I had an asthma attack at work and an ambulance was called, same thing with nebs and then something injected into my arm in the ambulance (I can‚Äôt remember the name of it) doctor basically said to just take pred again. 

I‚Äôve had this flare up for a good few weeks now and I had only been back at work for 1 and a half days after coming back from being sick with asthma. I feel that my rescue inhaler isn‚Äôt working anymore (I use ventolin) it never eases the breathing or tightness and always ends up in me going to A&amp;E. 

They have increased my dose of preventer and I‚Äôm taking montelukast. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, please help guys"

"I‚Äôm at the end of my rope here. Literally no idea what to do, but I‚Äôm so frustrated and in so much pain. I‚Äôm coughing and gagging non stop, nothing helps. 

My chest and stomach both hurt from coughing, I have so much mucus in the back of my throat. I‚Äôm currently taking my symbicort inhaler 2 puffs 4 times a day, borderline gonna start taking it 2 puffs 5 times. 

I‚Äôm also currently on prednisone. I started taking it Friday night, then Saturday morning and again this morning. But no bettering of symptoms yet. 

Is there anything else I can do? I can‚Äôt see my doctor until Tuesday morning and the hospital isn‚Äôt an option at this point."

I definitely am seeing some improvement but in the morning when i take it about an hour later i still cough up mucas is that normal ???
"Hi everyone so I‚Äôve been having shortness of breath for about a week now. I have never been diagnosed or checked for asthma but I am extremely scared. Whenever I run, walk, exercise ETC- I never get tired, or have trouble breathing. If anything it kind of helps with my shortness of breath sometimes . I don‚Äôt have any cough. Sometimes when I‚Äôm watching a movie, painting, anything that distracts me, I don‚Äôt notice my shortness of breath really being there. Whenever I watch the news, it comes back but like 10x worse. My nose is really dry though and I have been breathing out of my mouth sometimes. I haven‚Äôt been exercising as much as I‚Äôd like to over the past few months. I‚Äôve pretty much been a couch potato (quarantine life) Maybe I‚Äôm just out of shape and the combination of that plus my anxiety is making me feel this way ? I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm kinda new to this I just need some advice, my apologies if I sound dumb lol- I just feel like I‚Äôm lacking on getting enough oxygen in me. Thank you for taking the time to read this, if you did I really appreciate it !"

"Hello, long time asthma sufferer here. Recently quit smoking and have been feeling much better. I have been able to nearly ditch inhalers completely. However, lately I have been having random flare ups after days or weeks of feeling phenomenal. Where I live we have recently had a surge in rain storms and this has drastically increased the humidity in my small apartment. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if this could be the culprit for my difficulty in breathing? 

Has anyone else had or experienced similar issues? 

Lastly would it be worth my while to buy a dehumidifier?

Also, I have about 3 house plants. One is a big Monsterra which also is maybe a culprit of humidity, it‚Äôs just too hard for me to let her go. 

Thank you."
"Or, is it even asthma? When I get a cold or flu, my asthma symptoms do not get worse - in fact they disappear. They return after the cold or flu goes away. I never have asthma attacks at night. In fact, one of the ways I ward off an attack is to close my eyes, or better yet take a nap. Is this unusual? Could it be something different? I use atrovent for flare ups because albuterol interacts with a benign arrhythmia I have. The atrovent is almost useless most of the time. I take Qvar. I‚Äôm better with it than without it, but it isn‚Äôt doing all that much. Nasacort and Allegra are like candy to me, but I think I‚Äôve used them for so long that they‚Äôve lost their effectiveness. Most days I have mild breathlessness despite all the meds, and strong smells trigger my asthma now. What is going on? (Thanks for listening)"


Does anyone have any info on whether drinking alcohol make asthma symptoms worse or can it be a trigger? (None of the meds I take seem say anything about them having side effects from alcohol consuption.)
"I have recently been diagnosed with this after a couple of years of symptoms and looking to see if anyone else has this (or similar malacia type) and could share their experience? 
I've been given physiotherapy with a follow up session next month and a clinic visit and am wondering how long it could take to get back towards normality."
"Hi, I have been thinking of buying a home oxygen concentrator just in case there's some shortness of breath (my asthma or possible COVID). The hospitals don't have available beds (Philippines) here so I was thinking if it's just slight shortness of breath, the concentrator would help? It's not an expensive one. Just $200 USD. Concentration is 30-90% oxygen with flow of 1-7L per minute. So I assume the 90% oxygen is only at 1L per minute or maybe less. Is this worth it at all?"
"Last year around this time I developed ‚Äúbronchitis‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt breathe for about two weeks but with  everything going on I was just given steroids / z pack / inhaler. For months I didn‚Äôt feel right and I felt like I was manually breathing almost all the time. 

Had the same flare up a few months later and then end of December January I had the same issue and was COVID +.

This past week I went to another doc and he gave me some prednisone and a z pack and another inhaler and told me it sounds like I‚Äôm having bad asthma flare ups‚Ä¶.so as per his recommendation I‚Äôm going to a pulmonologist finally to figure this out. 

I‚Äôm incredibly frustrated with myself and how I wish I made this appt. sooner - I have been to the doctor for this about 5 times but also I‚Äôm 27 years old and I absolutely can not figure out what‚Äôs causing this.I‚Äôm not sure where to even start because I‚Äôm trying to find out the trigger for this but nothing is making sense."
I‚Äôm currently out drinking for the day. I‚Äôm just wondering incase I need it later but is it safe to take it whilst I‚Äôm drinking
I‚Äôve always had asthma which unfortunately has gotten worse as I‚Äôve gotten older. Currently in one of the worst ones I‚Äôve ever experienced and my doctor put me on prednisone. Should help me feel better but now my shitty immune system is suppressed and even more out of commission for the next week. In the middle of a pandemic. As cases start to rise.
"Hi. i've had this cough for 2 years now and i dont know hot to get rid of it. It started when i went overseas two years ago and havent been able to shake it off. I don't cough phlegm, but when i do cough it doesn't sound as crisp in my chest/throat region. 

I've seen a throat specialist who cleared me of GERD, i've had x-rays done on my chests and blood tests which came back fine. I did do a skin prickling test which shows im sensitive to pollen, dust mite and grass.

Can anyone give me advice here i dont know what to do?"
My chest hurt during &amp; after and then again tonight. Anybody else have that happen to them? It hurt so bad. It actually made my symptoms worse.
"How in the world are you supposed to carry around a rescue inhaler and not have it dispensing all over inside a bag? Mine, at least, has no safety switch out cap or anything, so if it gets bumped at all, it will dispense a dose. Is there something I'm missing?"
"The[CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html)says, ‚ÄùActive treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress your immune response.‚Äù

It doesn‚Äôt seem clear to me if asthmatics taking maintenance medication qualify or not. What do you think?"

"Anyone on it? I was put on it (specifically Uniphyllin Continus) at the start of the week and I've not felt much of a difference tbh, but then it will take a while, if it is gonna work. I'm also on Fostair 200/6 2 puffs twice a day, Spiriva Respimat 2 puffs, Ventolin as needed, Montelukast, Carbocistiene, and a bunch of antihistamines (including Dymista nasal spray) and various other medications for some other medical conditions I have. I'm coming off of Prednisolone tomorrow and was discharged from hospital yesterday after being in there for over a week. I'm just kind of fed up/shocked at how my asthma currently is? Any idea why there could  be a sudden severe uptick requiring multiple admissions? 

Hope everyone's doing alright!"

"I think I need to hear from others like me with asthma to help me better understand what is considered feeling normal with asthma and/or what is considered well-controlled.

IDK if age and stuff matters but 36/M/Good Shape.

Currently I'm on Arnuity Ellipta 200mg/day....which was increased about 2 months ago now from 100mg. I use a rescue inhaler when needed and before any workouts.

I could go into a lot of detail but I think for now I'm just curious what do you all consider ""normal"" living or Well-controlled asthma?

I know weather and stuff effects me for sure, plus allergies but I'm really not sure mine is considered well controlled. I use a peak flow at home to monitor and it always seems the same even when I'm not feeling great, so I don't think that's a good indicator. Unfortunately my asthma doctor seems to think that is the best way to tell if i need increases or different meds...etc. But I'm like, I KNOW how I'm feeling. 

Lately I've been having a cough. Its not horrible but it comes and goes, my chest feels eh but again not terrible. I know we asthmatics tend to ""normalize"" these things so I'm just like, what is NORMAL? And/or how do I get to a place where aside from OBVIOUS triggers, I should be able to do moderate activity without coughing or be outside on a humid day without being like, sorry no outside life for you. 

Sorry this is mostly a rant I guess, but the main point is, what's normal and do you all have any suggestions for other meds that help. I often think about why my doctor hasnt thought about something like  Singulair (Montelukast).  OH i've tried Breo, I cant remember how well that really worked for me, and i've tried symbicort....doesn't work and made me feel crappy. 

Thoughts?

Sidenote: This community is awesome! I've read so many things that have helped me with coping but haven't posted before...just a long time lurker/up-voter. LOL

\*Looks like I did go on and on a bit, sorry."
"I have pollen allergies during the summer, which makes my asthma worse for those months especially when I'm laying down. I noticed that during this time because of the breathing trouble I get a lot of anxiety. I guess it's a similar feeling to when your throat tightens from anxiety so it makes sense. I also seem to have many nightmares during this time, even though I don't usually have any during the rest of the year. Does anyone else have this?"
I've heard it's extremely common for people's asthma to get worse when it's wet and in the cold months. I seem to be the opposite. The heat and dry weather makes it harder for me to breath. Rainy days and cold season are when I get my best breathing. I'm just curious on others thoughts on asthma and the weather? Does anyone have any tips for asthma induced by heat?
So I have a ton of difficulty breathing and doctors do not know why . I've seen all the specialist you can think of my heart is good my lungs are clear. Idk what to do but I am miserable! I pass the spirometer test even when I'm having difficulty breathing! Wtf. Doe anyone have any idea of this is some sort of asthma or what ? I al 5'10 about 188 lbs.
"My asthma is finally coming under good good control, but I'm so sad I wasted my entire favorite season with wonderful weather and awesome time, indoors, a wreck, struggling to breathe :((("

[removed]
"I have finally been diagnosed with asthma after repeatedly going through AE and them telling me oh your oximeter reading is 98 while I‚Äôm dying. They did not give me a lung function test and I had to literally beg for an inhaler. It is just a fking saturation of oxygen level and does not mean shit. You can have shit volume of lung capacity yet have perfect saturation of oxygen. 

Finally a doctor was able relate to my pleas and gave me a proper MCT/diagnosis and treatment. I had been suffering for nothing due to this. I‚Äôm so angry"
"Do you like yours? Mine and her staff are laughably rude and abrupt but board certified, close by, on my insurance and thorough with all the latest equipment so I stay. I only have to see them once a year since my asthma is mild. Should I stay or look for a new one?"
"Going through some big life changes and my ex cut off my insurance.  I‚Äôve looked at goodrx and it‚Äôs still way more than I can afford.  I can‚Äôt even afford to eat.

I recently moved and called my doctor in NC and they said I‚Äôd need to come in if I wanted to switch meds and that they really need me to stay on the Trelegy.  I‚Äôm in Florida.  Not possible.

Freaking out.  I called GSK and am starting the process with them, but it takes weeks to get approved and that‚Äôs a big IF.

I just need to figure out this refill and I think I‚Äôll be ok, but I don‚Äôt know what to do."
My doctor prescribed me asmanex as maintenance for my mild asthma. I have seasonal allergies as well and I read asmanex can help with those as well (singular doesn‚Äôt cut it for me in the fall). The insurance company rejected asmanex and provides QVAR instead. Does anyone know if these are essentially the same thing? I would like to know before going to war with the insurance company. I can‚Äôt find too much about it online.
"I have been noticing this screechy high pitch noise that feels like something is vibrating against the back of my throat near the tongue, and it gives me shortness of breath. However, when I take my peak flow test with and without this shortness of breath feeling, I still aim in the 600-650+ range. Does this mean I have asthma, or something else like upper respiratory obstruction or? I'm so confused because albuterol helps after 10 mins or so :/"
"Four weeks of shortness of breath, tachycardia, and this horrible chronic cough and my doctors got me set up with a specialist who wants a CT after my chest x-rays came back clear. There was a mention of possibly needing contrast injected and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has had this before? I‚Äôm a tiny bit nervous about it."
"Hi all, do any of you deal with the tightness of asthma and not feeling like a you can get a breath but your oxygen saturation is fine. No matter what I do it didn't help. Inhalers, nebulizer, allergy medication for the congestion. Did says nothing they can do. To just get an allergy test. I just want to breath normal."
"Hi all-

 I use Pro Air as my emergency inhaler, which I like, but was wondering if anyone has used Primatene Mist and if so whether they liked it and whether it can substitute as an emergency inhaler. Lately I only have asthma around 2 or 3 am when I‚Äôm sleeping but it tespinds right away to Pro Air.

I will talk to my doctor I just wanted to see your all thoughts on this since you actually use it. 

Thanks in advance!"
"I've been diagnosed with asthma since I was around 4 years old after an allergic reaction. I've had asthma ever since when around things I'm allergic to, such as animals. I take my meds to keep it under control (Spiriva Respimat, Advair, and Albuterol) but lately have been having flare ups anyway. However, when I go to the doctor they do the standard lung function blow out the candles test and my results always come back perfectly normal and healthy, as if I don't have asthma at all. Anyone else have a similar experience? I absolutely feel what I think is asthma and when I have an attack my rescue inhaler stops it. But I'm so confused that my lungs seem fine at the doctor's office."
"This week I started out with a sore throat and major congestion and runny nose, two days later I mainly feel everything in my chest. It sucks and coughing is so painful. I was doing so well with not getting sick"
"the title says it all pretty much but what seems weird to me is that.

on the august 4. i came back from other country and tested negative on the airport, 1 day later i got tested again and i was positive.

everyone says mild covid is worse than common cold but i didnt have any symptoms that were worse than common cold (btw i have asthma and im not vaccinated) it's been 7 days since i tested positive and my symptoms are almost gone im still coughing a little bit and small breathing problems but that's about it, i never had fever and i never lost my apetite, no fatige,... is this it or should i expect symptoms in a few days? i heard some people get symptoms after 14 days but what seems weird to me is that i already had some mild symptoms...

as im writing this i thought about that: is it possible that i had common cold and that were the cold symptoms and covid symptoms are still yet to come?

i also have health anxiety so if anyone knows anything about that and could educate me on it i would be very grateful and relifed. thank you."
"Hey all, I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with viral induced adult asthma courtesy of COVID, and have been put on a steroid inhaler (Fostair) to help with the perpetual feeling of breathlessness. Ive only been using it for 24 hours, but after dealing with this for 2 months, am eager for it to start working already.

Just to get a sense, how long did it take for your steroid inhalers to kick in? Salbutamol unfortunately does nothing for me as my asthma is caused by inflammation in the small airways, so I‚Äôm hoping / praying that this will help."
"Had my first asthma attack in months yesterday. I threw open the windows, it was a great kind of spring-feeling day, and I didn't think of the pollen count until I coughed up a lung and started wheezing. I'm always prepared for this though, so I have my emergency pump, prednisone, the whole job. If I ignore the still blazing fire in my airways today, the day old feeling of gargling razor blades (we all love that specific cough, right?), the worst thing is the uncontrollable shakes from the salbutamol. I can't write, I can't type, I can't hold a book steady enough to read. I can't sew, I can't embroider. I'm literally listening to the seconds tick by, waiting until I don't shake."
" Hi guys

I live in SYD and have been in lockdown for the past 2 months and maybe the next 2 months at this rate. Before lockdown, I was trying to get my fitness and cardio up by doing some HIIT (bodyweight stuff like pushups and burpees), the occasional swim, and running interval training. Mainly, I wanted to improve my own asthma due to personal commitments.

Since lockdown, I have been stuck at home without many chances to actually go for a run. So just wondering if anyone has any exercises they can recommend for some stuck at home but still wants to improve fitness, running, and cardio specifically (e.g. jump rope exercises?)

Cheers"
"Does anyone get scared when their breathing is off or do you get used to this asthma thing the longer you have it? Like I can have several off days with this air quality here in the Ohio Valley (sucks). But does it get easier dealing/ managing? I get so scared!! I just got over covid, still have slight chest congestion. Clear X-ray on the 2nd‚Ä¶ but I fear 24/7. How does this get better? I fear reading these inhalers can cause pneumonia‚Ä¶ would I survive that? I fear will winter months be easier or harder. It‚Äôs all so new and scary. I get consumed in this fear/unknown. I never knew how badly I took for granted ‚Äúbreathing‚Äú until asthma. I truly hate this!!! I also find it crazy how others symptoms can be so different from others. I never had a cough or wheezing. Just difficult breathing even sitting or laying down‚Ä¶ I notice asthma less when I‚Äôm busy and active. It just sucks!!! I hate it. Rant over I‚Äôm sorry."

"I just moved to a new apartment complex that has a sauna! Everything is newly remodeled, so no evidence of mold or anything. I've read a few places that sauna can help with asthmatic symptoms, and the few times I've tried it, I've felt really good afterward and had higher peak flow results, so I want to try to do it more often.

For the last 24 hours my asthma has been acting up and I‚Äôm not sure why. It went away for a few hours and I felt good and then it got worse once it got later in the day. It feels like my chest is tight. I‚Äôve been panicking and my anxiety is through the roof. I have more of an allergic asthma than anything. I checked my AccuWeather app and it says the air quality is fair. I have a lot of triggers and dust and dander is one of them. It says dust and dander is ‚Äúvery high‚Äù right now and it‚Äôs very humid at 88% not sure if that matters. I take an albuterol inhaler and haven‚Äôt used it yet. I don‚Äôt like to use it unless I really have too. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm wheezing just taking deep breaths and my body feels bloated. I do have my flair ups every now and then especially during the summer. I‚Äôve been stuffy in my nose all day which is normal for me but it‚Äôs clear. I have a oximeter that‚Äôs been going up and down from 99%-97% and went 96% for about a few seconds. Not sure how accurate it is but it usually stays at 98-99% on average. Any idea what could be the issue?
"I have severe asthma I am assuming since albuterol seems to be working in 10-15 mins, but it makes me numb; symbicort and advair didnt' seem to work. It seems like my lungs get irritated very easily during night time and it gives me sleeping issues. I have already tried prednisone, montelukast but that did not work.

Any other suggestions? I am sure this is some type of asthma since after I am bloated or such I hear high pitch wheezing"
Basically it's just slightly labored breathing. I've used my nebulizer and rescue inhaler. This has happened before and it took a few days to go away. Mine isn't controlled well but this isn't common. Anyone else experience this? I've had like 5 cups of coffee as well to try and open my chest up. Been about 24 hours

"I've been using NAC for around 5 months now becuase i've had quite a lot of phlegm and noticed an improvement in breathing for a while, but i felt out of the routine of taking it daily. Recently i've been coughing up small, hard, dark green bits and this morning decided to take some NAC again and want to stay on it now and not fall out of the routine. 

The bottle i have is 600mcg, but this morning i took 2 because of this problem i have (would rather stay away from antibiotics and steroids if possible, they're not good for us at all.) I'm not sure if it's just in my mind but already i'm noticing a slight improvement in my breathing and it's evening now. i'm just wondering what dosage others that take NAC are on. I need to read up on NAC and if they're are possible side effects if on a dosage too high."
"I just wanted to whine about being in a flair. I‚Äôm back to nebulizing four times a day, Breo once a day, singulair at night.  I just hate asthma.

Do I have asthma or just a fat body ex smoker who damaged lungs. I went for a run for the first time since high school and was out of breath at about 1 mile in. I quit smoking the devils lettuce a a few week ago. Have some chest tightness throughout the day but not as much phlegm. I also work as a barnacle scraper cleaning boats underwater. I‚Äôm scared I gave myself asthma. I‚Äôm trying to join the military right now too.
"Hello fellow asthmatics! 


Im 34y/o male living in the UK. 

I've had asthma all my life, its easily controlled and doesn't really cause me much grief. 5 years ago i was diagnosed with Gad ( general anxiety disorder ) i suspect ive had this for years but it was finally acknowledged. 

Now here's my issue... 

Im not allowed any medication for my GAD because the risk it could effect my asthma. Ive done my research and yes i agree there are risks but has anyone in this sub been prescribed anxiety medication?  

Im Specifically interested in Cardioselective beta blockers as they are the safest option for an asthmatic but sadly my GP wont prescribe these, which is fair enough I wouldn't want her to get in trouble ( she says she could loose her licence ) but im still not getting any help and each day really is a struggle for me.

They're happy to give me all the antiperspirant's under the sun might i add. 

Im sorry to post about anxiety here, I'd just like to know if anyone else is in the same boat.

Thanks for reading."
"Hey,

I had a pretty horrible asthma attack last night, I have a slight cold just now which likely brought it on.  I tried a million and one breathing exercises, postures and remedies during it, including my Ventolin, with only minor or very temporary relief. 

I resorted to what I usually resort to when I'm not looking to be hospitalised. 

I did some press-ups, just a few to get the blood rushing and my airways opened up almost immediately with almost all of the mucus draining away. 

Why does this work? 

I can't find anything online about this as it's all just the usual medical prevention of triggers and ""take your medication"". 

Does anybody have any insight or experience on this and perhaps any other odd remedies that work similarly?"
"I tried a lot of inhalers, breo seemed to work the best but not 100 percent.  Symbicort worked the same. Dulera didnt do squat and same with flovent so far. My only issues are randomly I feel like I'm taking shallow breaths for 30 min to an hour and it goes away. Happens randomly. Sometimes I feel like I have to force myself to take deep breaths. Idk what to do. I'd go back to breo but it costs way too much. Any advice? Thanks!"

hello everyone,

I would really appreciate it if you took the time to help me with your experience.

I am currently on the 250 dose (not sure if mg or what) of Advair (I‚Äôm sure many of you know it is an asthma steroid - this is the only medicine I have other than a rescue inhaler). I take it twice a day. With this medicine, my breathing is very good. I can run regularly without any issues. I don't have any symptoms unless I forget to take my Advair twice a day.

I am hoping to stop taking this medicine, but I don't know if it would be safe. Ideally, I would like to stop taking any medicine, but I don't know if this is an option.  

I have asked my doctor about this once, and they said that I should try not taking it for a while and using my inhaler as needed. I tried this, and I was constantly short of breath and I used my inhaler daily (this was over a year ago and I don't remember the full details of my symptoms). I didn‚Äôt try avoiding my inhaler and Advair at the same time, though. I eventually gave up and went back to Advair. I never have to take my inhaler while I am taking Advair. I won‚Äôt be able to get an appointment with my doctor for a while, so I chose to seek help on the internet.

Have any of you had a similar experience? How old were some of you when you outgrew Asthma? Has anyone outgrown it as an adult (like at age 30, for example)?

I‚Äôm hoping that I‚Äôm someone who has asthma when they are young but outgrows it when they age. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be that lucky, though. Thanks again for reading my post!"
Been on medication for TB since January and should be  finishing up my course (6 month treatment). But still kind of battle with breathing. Obviously going to bring this up to my doc at next check up but Was wondering if my asthma has compounded the affect of TB. Curious if anyone has had who can share their stories. This shit is terrifying.
I‚Äôve had asthma my whole life but mostly just exercise induced. Two years ago I had bad bronchitis and have been dealing with moderate asthma since. I take advair twice a day and rescue inhaler maybe once every few days. A year and a half ago I had a panic attack on a plane while flying because I felt trapped with my asthma. I know it‚Äôs well controlled but i‚Äôm supposed to fly in two days and i‚Äôm a nervous wreck. Anyone have any trouble flying? What do you guys do to feel better or make it through the flight?
"I've had asthma my whole life. I have allergy induced asthma and over the years I grew out of it. It got to the point where I would use my inhaler 1-2 times a year. Today I checked my self into the ER because my inhaler has not been working for more than 20 minutes. First time in a decade. I am sad about it, happens just when everything was going well for me. I know it's the smoke from the fires in the USA. Climate change is going to make a difficult life for us asthmatics. Stay strong ‚úäüèº."
I just started taking symbicort like 3 days ago and I noticed that time seems to pass by really quickly when I'm on this medication has anyone else noticed this? Also my heart rate feels a lot different
Don't try to run a trail marathon when the AQI is 170.  It won't be fun and you'll wake up the next day feeling like you got kicked in the chest.
"Recently had spirometry tests due to chest tightness and shortness of breath. My peak blow test was perfect however inflammation was found, and so my lung specialist has said it is ‚Äúmost likely asthma‚Äù. Upon talking to him, I said I get terrible hayfever and that normally makes me wheezy (as it does to my twin too) but other than this, I don‚Äôt experience anything. 

For the past month, my chest has been terribly tight with shortness of breath (oxygen always been between 97-100). I have been prescribed inhalers but they really do scare me as they make my heart rate increase and give me anxiety but I know why that is, it just doesn‚Äôt make it any less scary for me. It makes me nervous that the consultant said I ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù have asthma because it sounds like there‚Äôs no definite diagnosis, and it‚Äôs just a guess‚Ä¶

So, I‚Äôm scared that if I start inhalers, this will be for life. I feel like I may have seasonal asthma, just in the summer, so I just feel a bit lost with it. I had asthma as a child, and then lost it for an entire decade. Any tips or experiences with inhalers are so appreciated. Even if you can relate with my chest tightness which feels even tighter upon breathing in. My heart rate has been slightly elevated too (when not taking inhalers; I‚Äôve been cleared by two cardiologists, not even sure if this is anxiety over breathlessness). Thanks in advance"
Will the effect wear off over time? Do any of you guys do this?


"My doctor thinks I'm having an asthma flair as I cannot catch my breath and have felt short of breath for 2 weeks now. She prescribed 4 days of Prednisone and I'm actually terrified of these side effects. I have anxiety already, and the thought of being 'high' or out  of control terrifies me. I almost want to put up with the horrible feeling of not being able to breathe.
Does it always cause this symptoms?"
"I‚Äôve had asthma almost my whole life. As a kid it was bad, got steadily better as I got older where I hardly noticed it until obvious triggers (like allergens).

In college I started running a lot, and I that helped keep it at bay even more.

Just before covid it started coming back and in full force. To the point I now have a steroid inhaler and allergy shots.

Im running again and I feel better than a year ago but now I‚Äôm wondering - was it always this bad? Did I just not notice in college?

Does anyone know of a resource that compares normal, healthy breathing to the feeling post-inhaler of a wide open chest? Is that what breathing is always supposed to feel like or is it extreme because it‚Äôs drug induced?"
"I am thinking of buying a portable nebulizer one for my cold and cough, is it worth it ? Sometimes, I get sinus attack, so maybe I will put down some medicine in and use it but I don't get the fever that often but rarely. Still, it disrupts my mood when I'm about to give my presentations and it gets very difficult as well. So, maybe it will help for a quick relieve. I don't suffer from Asthma or anything tho."
"Hi folks, new here. 

I live in the western states and there has been a ton of smoke for several weeks from all the fires. I started having really irritated lungs and a cough. I have mild exercise induced asthma and an Albuterol inhaler for years now. 

I've never used flovent but my doctor put me on it after I went to see him with my cough not going away. I've been feeling sick and nauseous off and on for 2 weeks or so. I've been on the inhaler for 3ish weeks. I see that these can sometimes be side effects from it. 

Does anyone else have experience with flovent and having these same side effects? Trying to figure out if this is the main cause of it and how common this is. 

The inhaler is helping but I'm also worried about stopping it when the time comes if I have a rebound effect. If you've used flovent, did you experience a rebound effect upon stopping? 

I've talked with my doctor about all this of course, just looking for personal experience from others."

"I quit smoking 17 years ago, but was a heavy smoker before I quit (2-3 packs a day). I was not diagnosed with asthma until last year, 16 years later. I asked my pulmonologist and he said if his patients aren't smokers his diagnosis is asthma. If they are smokers first COPD with asthma. I asked him what mine was and he says since you quit smoking so long ago it's probably a little bit of both but mostly asthma. I'm asking this question because every few days or so I have so much phlegm in my lungs and try to cough it up. I don't know if this is also a symptom of asthma. Does anyone have any knowledge or opinions on this? When you have asthma do you cough up a lot of phlegm and how often? Thanks for reading this newbies post."

"Exactly as title says I'm in a rough place right now i'm going to keep it short.

I had asthma as I child but then it cleared up. A few days ago I started getting mild symptoms eg. coughing, wheezing, chest pain and it only got worse from there. I told my asthmatic friend my symptoms and she said it's exactly what it feels like to her, and she just told me to stay calm, breathe, etc. I can't go to a GP because they said they're not treating anyone with any covid symptoms even if you produce a negative test what is the best thing I can do right now? I'm already drinking more coffee than usual

PS I told my friend that I'll just wait it out, avoid triggers, if anything happens I'm going straight to the ER and she said that's a good plan

What else could it be? I don't have any other health conditions, no allergies, nothing. I don't have a fever or a loss of taste and smell. 

Thank you in advance"
"My doctor prescribed singulair for my uncontrolled asthma, but I read that it can cause suicidal thoughts, and that is a non starter for me due to past post partum depression. 

Any alternatives I should make sure to discuss with my doctor that doesn't have that side effect? I'm currently taking symbicort, Flonase, and Allegra. Sudafed helps me a lot as well."
"Due to work I completely forgot to take my daily Singulair last night at 10:30pm-11pm. It is 12:58pm as Im writing this now.. should i take it or wait for tonight? It‚Äôs the only asthma medication I take aside from claritin. 

Thanks in advance."
"Recently lost my mother to asthma :(. Her inhaler wasn't helping her to recover completely for about 4 days. Had a virtual appointment (due to covid) with doctor on 5th day. Doctor's medicine seem to not help her much, next day she was better but at night she seem to struggle a bit and wokeup us late when she struggled to breath. Things happened fast and within minutes she couldn't breathe completely she struggled and died.

We should've taken her to emergency but relied on my mother to tell us of she doesn't feel better then so we can take her to hospital. We shouldn't have relied on her. Unfortunately we forgot to test her oxygen levels on that day. The day before her oxygen levels were good.

Couldn't able to accept the fact that our mom is no more. I feel immense guilt that I didn't take a wise decision in time and took a risk in the fear of COVID-19 and relied completely in my mother to alert us in case she wants to go to hospital immediately. Don't know how could I recover from this. The guilty feel in me says the only justice for my mistake is death. But, having a family with kids makes me not to do so. My mother's hardwork is one of the main reasons why our family is happy today and as son I didn't do my duty to save her."

"I‚Äôve lived with asthma my hole life (my first memory is an asthma attack that had me in the hospital), but for many years I lived in somewhat denial of how bad my asthma was. I recently went in for allergy testing, and my breathing numbers were really bad, so I was put on twice-a-day Flovent HFA. After one dose, within minutes, I was amazed at how well I could breath, and now I‚Äôm determined to actually take care of my asthma symptoms, however I am having some side effects from the medication and am noticing just how often I get asthma symptoms in a day. I‚Äôm looking for advice regarding these things:

1. The steroid inhaler is majorly irritating my mouth and throat. The first time I took my inhaler, it was just itchiness, but after two days it‚Äôs now constant pain. I‚Äôve looked in my mouth, and the areas that are bothering my are really red, and the pain in my throat and roof of mouth is making it hard for me to eat. I do wash my mouth well (including gargling and teeth brushing after each dose), and I also am following the correct technique. Will this go away once I get used to it? Is there anything I can do to mitigate this? I have a spacer for my emergency use inhaler, should I use it with the Flovent HFA as well? I am also considering only taking the dose at night and not in the morning. I go back to see the doctor who prescribed it next Friday to check how the treatment is treating me.

2. Just when should I be using my emergency inhaler? I often get really mild wheezing, and I try to use it then, but this has resulted in me using it at least once a day. I know from the years where I was under the false impression that my symptoms were just normal that I can get away with not taking it under these circumstances. Should i be taking it whenever I get wheezing, or just when I need it?"

"I take symbicort two puffs twice a day. Just started yesterday. Giving me major anxiety. Any alternatives? 

Should I stop taking it?"
"Hey all,  


  
I've posted here once before, late last year or so. I have been having shortness of breath/chest tightness issues ongoing for the past 16 months or so now. I've been through all the motions test wise, seeing my primary care provider, gastroenterologist, allergist, pulmonologist, and ENT doctor. I am apparently highly allergic to pollen, weeds, grass, and dust mites after an allergy test. Allergic asthma would seem to make sense, however when I went in for my spirometry test, the pulmonologist said I had ""normal"" numbers, not indicative of someone with asthma.   


  
I then followed up with a methacholine challenge test and had zero reaction to it. My breathing numbers after the fifth and final dosage during the test were higher than my baseline numbers. The pulmonologist stated that it is ""extremely unlikely"" that I have reactive airway disease (asthma.)  


  
I have had VCD ruled out recently by an ENT after scoping me, even after exercise which is when the shortness of breath hits hardest.  


I have had an EKG, chest CT scan with the injectable dye, and echocardiogram done on my heart to rule out blood clots or heart issues.  


  
I guess my question to you guys is do any of you get relief from ICS or the like even though you may have presented with normal spirometry or methacholine test numbers? Do any of you experience asthma symptoms but don't have any of the traditional wheezing or coughing symptoms? I don't cough or wheeze at all, just shortness of breath with mucus production and chest tightness. Albuterol will take the edge off for me, just doesn't eliminate symptoms completely. I'm wondering if it's worth going on some form of ICS or the like to see if it helps anyway. I don't want to become dependent on using the albuterol for relief. Sorry for the rant."
"On occasion (like now) I‚Äôm left with no inhalers for a few days (normally 2-4) because of reasons such as not noticing how low they are until it‚Äôs too late or not having enough money to order new ones.

During the short time when I don‚Äôt have any inhalers and I become wheezy and my chest tightens, it stays like that every single day until I get new inhalers and take them.

But why is it that? I feel like after a while my body chest would untigthen on it‚Äôs own, my wheeziness would stop, etc, etc?"

Any tips or help me calm down? I can‚Äôt afford meds right now really really struggling to breathe.
"So I have asmtha, But now I've tested positive for coronavirus, in addition I have a dust mite allergy and possibly a weak immune system making me high risk, could I die?"


"I got one of those cheap manual spirometers off amazon and I am consistent at 350 L/min. I am 32 yo, female, 5'2"", 120 lbs. I do have a hard time breathing while exercising and running but I have been sedentary until recently. No other symptoms and no coughing or wheezing."
"I've discovered a new joy in my life. Before, all my favorite songs, I would want to sing with the artists, but I literally wouldnt be able to do it easily. I thought it was just cause they were professionals and I was a noob. 

Ever since I increased my dosage of steroid inhaler, I can easily sync up my words with the artist's lyrics. Maybe my voice isnt as beautiful but I can easily sing them at their pace.

Asthma control is great. My peak flows are also breaking the bar (they go to the top of the entire meter thing) :)"
My boyfriend and a few friends have asthma and I want to know more about it and what I can do to support them in an asthma attack. I saw one and they didn't have an inhaler and just didn't know what to do. It wasn't sudden but it makes me worry what to happen if it is sudden and and they don't have their inhaler.
"Until a year ago, I was taking 2x100mg Fostair a day. After a pretty serious attack, I needed to start taking more doses to keep my asthma under control. My pulmonologist told me to start taking 2x200mg a day, which is what I'm currently taking. But now my asthma is gradually slipping out of control again. The dosage doesn't suppress my symptoms for as long as it used to, sometimes no longer than 10 hours before I can feel mucus rasping in my chest or taste it on my breath. I sometimes wake up pain in the bottom of my chest, which thankfully goes away quickly. Exercise winds me faster than before, even with my bronchodilator inhaler. I still breathe fine, I don't have attacks unless triggered by one of my few allergies. All things considered, I'm probably not that bad off. However, I'm scared that I've somehow grown resistant to ICS medication, and that I'll just keep getting worse. It's probably irrational, but it's stressing me out. Has anyone experienced Fostair no longer being sufficient? I could really use some reassuring words.

I've got an appointment with my doctor on the 26th. I hope to get my asthma under control quickly."
"My wife has suffered from extremely severe, disabling asthma for the last 6 years.  She is on around 5 different asthma medications, the max allowed of every single one possible, and would still need to do her albuterol nebulizer multiple times some days.  She has been on prednisone on top of all of that for months at a time.  

On top of the asthma, she has had really bad acid reflux.  It is well known there is a connection between acid reflux and asthma, since you breathe in the acid.  We wanted to fix the acid reflux both to stop that pain and because we hoped it would help her asthma.  What we didn't know - and we don't think is well known - is that the acid reflux was a mechanical issue due to her esophagus sphincter not closing correctly due in part to a hiatal hernia.  She went in for surgery to install a medical device called a linx that closes the sphincter (thereby fixing the mechanical issue) but at the same time the surgeon fixed a 2-3 cm hiatal hernia.  

Immediately after the surgery, she felt like she could breath much much better.  We researched it, and found a study that showed that a test group of patients with severe asthma and acid reflux/GERD experienced massive improvement in their asthma symptoms after the hiatal hernia fix/esophagus fix.    She said that she feels like she can finally expel all the air in her lungs, and although she still has some asthma her symptoms are much better.  She thinks that her asthma was in part a mechanical issue, and that the hiatal hernia repair fixed that (hiatal hernia is at your diaphragm).  

I wanted to share since we really wish we had known this years ago.  If you have asthma combined with bad reflux/GERD and lifestyle changes don't fix it, then I would recommend looking into surgery."
"Dear lungs,

Why you gotta be such a bitch huh? Why you getting so emotional and worked up over every little tiny thing? No, that tiny piece of dust isnt going to destroy you, nor can it do anything. No, that piece of pollen isn't going to light you on fire. Live and let live. Just shut the fuck up and stop overreacting.  I shouldn't have to call my steroid inhaler every single day, twice a day, to police your little stupid immature bitch ass.

Dear smooth muscle,

You're even worse than the lungs. Where do I even start? Sure, lungs may be overrreacting and inflaming like an  absolute bitch, but why you gotta constrict??? Literally 90 percent of people's smooth muscles dont do anything, they just sit there. You have literally one job----to do nothing and you even failed at that. You're an absolute disgrace."

"Hi! (I hope this post is allowed)   


So I don't have asthma (s far as I know) but my sister does. I've been struggling with breathing problems (negative covid test) for months now - but it's always triggered by food, and ever the same food. Sometimes after eating, even if something I eat every day with no issues, I'll suddenly feel like I can't breathe - my nose gets congested and I can't breathe though it, and breathing through my mouth feels like I've trying to catch my breath after a sprint.   


My sister said it reminds her of her asthma. I went to see a GP but she did blood tests instead and said they were fine so I must be fine. She did listen with her stethoscope, and seemed to think it was fine...  


Does anyone here know if food could be causing asthma attacks, even if it's not obvious and consistent triggers? And will a stethoscope show up asthma?   


thanks for any info"
"I always know if I‚Äôve forgotten to take my preventer inhaler in the morning, because by before lunch I start getting light headed, tight chested and I feel really dizzy. Then like clockwork, the coughing will begins Soon after remembering taking the preventer, it all goes away even without using my rescue. (Note - I don‚Äôt ever not take my asthma meds, sometimes I just get scooped up and busy at work in the morning so I forget to do it right away).

It makes me wonder how much this medication actually does a lot more than I think. I always feel like my asthma is mild because I rarely need to use my rescue anymore, but actually could it just be that the preventer inhaler I use is just really effective at keeping it under control?

Does anybody else feel a big change when you forget to take your preventer? I know this all sounds kinda dumb and obvious, but it just blows my mind how much of our lives we might actually owe to these medications and treatment plans."
"It is massively depressing being in my youth and having summer after summer going through countless fires and terrible air quality to the point where I can't even enjoy activities that I love or be outdoors because my asthma is effected even by the slightest moderate - unhealthy metrics on the air quality scale on the respective websites that do this kind of data collection....

Now, another summer and looking at the forecasts, there is a string of days in a row of moderate air quality and now my plans feel scary to even do heavy activity outside and what not. 

It is just highly frustrating and hurting my quality of life because I literally am having to be trapped inside the house during these times and it sucks. 

My asthma isn't horrible and is pretty controlled since I exercise a lot, eat healthy, and take my preventative inhalers but I just am struggling with these limitations. 

I remember a couple summers ago I went boating while there was visible smoke outside mistakenly enough and came down with asthma attacks for like the next 2 days and having to pump myself up with albuterol every 2-4 hours and it was miserable"
"This is so weird, I just made garlic bread (I‚Äôve done it 2 times before this) and I was standing near the oven and suddenly the garlic smell became a lot and then my lungs felt kinda cold and empty (like filled with air but otherwise empty?)

Im going to use my inhaler anyway, but does anyone know if thats normal, concerning etc, or has experienced something similar?"
Still fairly new to my asthma diagnosis- I see a lot of people on here talk about being hospitalized from their asthma. When do you know you need to go to the hospital? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt that bad (knock on wood) but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd know if I got to that point!

"Recently I've been diagnosed with Asthma. It was a rather controversial diagnosis -- my Spirometry results were bad, and the bronchodilator response was negative, but the test was technically flawed, so it was disregarded in the diagnosis itself. I have some doubts about whether the diagnosis is right or not, which causes a lot of stress and anxiety. Regardless, I was at a hospital, had a CT with contrast, bronchoscopy and a ton of blood tests and it ruled out a lot of bad stuff, so doctors went with asthma diagnosis based on signs of chronic inflammation in the bronchis and a clean CT. I'm currently taking Symbicort and Montelukast and I feel better. I've been taking them for a month now, but I still get symptoms. When I first went to the ER I could barely breathe at all. Now it's like, I get hours of bad breathing and then I get some relief. My problem with it all is, after certain point I stopped really improving. It's more like, I get good and bad days and the symptoms seem steadily more or less the same. I've been taking the meds for about a month or so now.

Also, I regularly check my o2 with a Pulseoximeter. It's always normal range, but at times at night before sleep I get weird sensations in my head, like a rising pressure in my skull and tingly feeling at the top of my head - when I check the o2 it's always low when it happens. It only lasts a few seconds and if I get up it resolves immediately. Also, the o2 reading can be somewhat compromised because Pulseoximeters do need some time to show accurate reading, but I'm sure it drops because normally the value is instantly within the normal range, but when I get the sensations it can start off with even below 90% range then climb back up quickly when the symptoms resolve. I have doubts about the diagnosis and really worry about this symptom. It only happens at night and when I try to fall asleep -- when I close my eyes. Doesn't happen when I'm lying down just watching TV. Doesn't happen everyday. Just some days. Has anyone had similar experience? Should I doubt the diagnosis?"

"He has Allergic asthma / Allergic rhinitis according to the few pulmonologists we've been to. When he was around 3-4 we treated him with Flixotide and Singulair. The Singulair didn't do much. After stopping Flixotide he had a big asthma attack. Then we went to a different pulmonologist and they told us that corticosteroids would be really damaging for him in the long-run and they suggested Xyzal nasal drops. Then he had another sever asthma attack around June 2021, and we gave him Medrol. Since then he has been having wheezing sound in his chest when sleeping. 

Throughout the years we've been treating his asthma attacks with Ventolin and eventually Medrol (Once or twice a year, when the Ventolin didn't help).  

We're currently threating him mainly with Xyzal (and Ventolin whenever he has an asthma attack). We've been to a few pulmonologists in the last year and a few of them insisted on Pulmicort treatment, while the other few told us that we need to tackle the allergy (and they also told us that Pulmicort would be bad for him and is a harsh treatment for such a young child). 

I think that's pretty much all of it. Now the dilemma is what to do - Should we continue to try and tackle the allergy, or should we go for corticosteroids (Pulmicort), or is there another alternative? What about Salbutamol or will that be bad for him as well?

I also forgot to mention that Back in 2017 we did allergy tests and it said that he has allergies to Rye, Stink bugs, Hazel, Oak and Plantago, so the lady who ran the tests said that the tests were good.

I recently bought him a Peak Flow Meter (MIR SMART ONE) after reading here on this subreddit (None of my pulmonologists have ever suggested that) so I'm not sure if they're good enough to know the right treatment for my brother, especially when half of them are contradicting the other half. Now I'm posting here with the hope that someone that's a lot more knowledgeable than I am can give me some good advise, I wonder what to do next. I'm not a doctor and I'm just worried about my small brother, so all the advice/help is appreciated."
"So, the caption says it all. I had well controlled asthma and had no symptoms for almost a year. I use combination inhaler which includes beclomethasone and formoterol, 2 doses in the morning and 2 doses in the evening. I have also a rescue inhaler (salbutamol) but I didn‚Äôt need to use it until this summer.

On july I had my first asthma flare up since when I got the diagnosis. My doctor prescribed me Montelukast, and my symptoms, such as shortness of breath, went away. However, two weeks ago I got sick and had a mild flu and the familiar symptoms came back. I was adviced to take more doses of the prevention inhaler for a week. It has been now a little bit over a week, and I had maybe 3-4 days when my asthma symptoms had completely disappeared - but now they are back!

I‚Äôm so tired of these symptoms. It‚Äôs so annoying that suddenly my old medication isn‚Äôt enough, and I don‚Äôt know what has happened. I‚Äôm not sick anymore, and the flu was really really mild - only a slighlty sore throat. Has anyone had similar experiences with these random asthma flare ups? How you got symptom-free (if that‚Äôs even possible)?"

Can bisoprolol be a safer alternative to metoprolol for my asthma but be as useful for my palpitations that recently increased due to stimulant initiation for treatment of ADD.

"I‚Äôve taken it for years and Advair before that, and now suddenly I can‚Äôt take it without gagging and retching uncontrollably! It‚Äôs been like this for weeks now. 

I‚Äôve already emailed my doctor about this, but I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else? Was it only temporary? Was another medication better?"
"I've been on Xolair since 2015 for chronic urticaria and asthma. The plan was to start trying to get pregnant this fall and I just spoke to my allergist about Xolair and pregnancy. She said it is APPROVED for pregnancy but there isn't a lot of data on it. She personally has had two patients on it through pregnancy but of course the babies are still...babies. Healthy so far but that's her personal experience.

"32M, 228 pounds, 5‚Äô8‚Äù
Not very physically active
GERD, Sleep Apnea, GAD

The last two days, I‚Äôve become incredibly breathless during physically activity specifically moving furniture and walking up a very steep hill at work. The more intense the heat is, the worse the symptoms are.

I‚Äôve been largely physically inactive for two years, but I‚Äôve always really struggled with walking up steep hills even when in decent physical shape and have always struggled to run outdoors. Indoors, I‚Äôm usually okay.

When these episodes happen, I cannot talk and walk at the same time, my nose dries out, my mouth dries out, and I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe in at all. I breathe through my mouth almost like I‚Äôm gasping, but can get it better when I breathe through my nose. I then struggle to breathe for about 20-30 minutes. I am not short of breath, but I have to breathe shallow.

I have an inhaler that does seem to help. Once my heart rate hits about 120 or so, the breathlessness starts. Once my Hr returns to a normal level, I‚Äôm fine. This happens in my home as well, but not as concerning.

This is a new development as the same work hill didnt bother me just 2 months ago before the school year ended. I saw an allergist and he suspects potentially mild asthma but nothing worse. I have no allergies. 

I‚Äôm just not sure what asthma feels like, but this has been an issue for a few months."
"I'm in 1 city, my family doctor is in another city across the province. I refuse to switch family doctors right now as I'm in the middle of a health crisis and know she's reliable when it comes to paperwork and responses and prescriptions and I need the stability she offers while everything else is going to shit. Everything from every specialist gets sent to her and I just don't have the energy or desire to find a new doctor in the middle of this and change where everything goes.

That said, I need the pneumonia vaccine. I recently obtained my vaccination records from childhood and found out I am missing about half of my shots- not a surprise given my upbringing but still disappointing. Pneumonia has a history going back 3 generations in the bloodline, killing 2 people and hospitalizing 1 for a month (most recent case). I would really really like to get this vaccine.

For those without access to a family doctor: How did you get your vaccine? Everything I'm finding is for covid vaccines right now (understandably so!) but there's gotta be some people dealing with normal health issues right?

Can I just go to a walk-in clinic and get it? Do I need to call first and make an appointment? Help?"

"About me:
- new to moderate (severe?) uncontrolled asthma in the last year 
- late 20s, non smoker, history of allergies
- triggered by dust, pet dander, pollen
- Zenhale &amp; spiriva controllers and ventolin/salbutomol rescue inhaler, per respirologist &amp; family doctor
- Ontario, Canada

Housing is too expensive to buy my own place in my hometown.

I'm scared of signing a one year lease, but having asthma after moving in. I had to leave my last apartment because my apartment was making me so sick. I developed asthma, was passing out, couldn't breathe. 

As an asthmatic, how do you find apartments to live in? Does your landlord accommodate you in some way?

Is there a way to try out an apartment before you sign a one year lease? Should I resign myself to living with my parents forever (where it is clean and I have less symptoms in their home, only occasional dust)? 

What do you look for in an apartment? Tips &amp; tricks would give this girl some hope here."

"Obviously, there is no ""best"" inhaler, and I get that, but I've seen time and time again that most doctors and asthmatics first choice inhaler is flovent, and lots of people seem to like it. In my experience, flovent was pretty darn good for me as well."
"Like the title says, I‚Äôve been struggling with my breathing all spring and summer long. I‚Äôm starting to feel a little insane, so I‚Äôm wondering if this type of thing has happened to anyone else so I feel at least a little less crazy.

I‚Äôve had every test possible: breathing test, pulmonary function test, allergy prick test, sub-q test and blood test, chest x ray, chest ct scan. Nothing shows any disease or illness. My blood levels are great, my lung capacity is above average, and yet I struggle to breathe daily. 

I‚Äôm on two maintenance inhalers and have two rescue inhalers (Breo Ellipta, Spirivia, Combivent, and Albuterol). They seem to keep things at bay so that i can get a sustainable level of oxygen, but it‚Äôs far from full breath. It does seem to be connected to pollen since it gets worse when the pollen count goes up. But idk if that‚Äôs the cause or just an additional irritant.

I‚Äôve had some breathing issues in past years, but never anything like this. Anyone else have this experience? 

Thanks for reading."
"I was prescribed some pred for a flareup of wheezing (and I may have forgotten/neglected to take my advair for over a week) and my wheezing returned.

"Hi everyone,

I've had exercise-induced asthma for a while, but recently noticed some mild symptoms that made me think my asthma was getting worse (struggle with intense exercise even after a couple of puffs/some very rare breathlessness before sleep). I went to a new pulmonologist since I recently moved to a new country. My lung capacity was normal. But, he prescribed the Foster inhaler (beclometasone and formoterol) for two weeks to see if my lung function test improves with the medication. He said if it does then my lungs are likely getting worse (since the improved function test would indicate the inhaler had a positive effect). 

My question is: Is this a normal way to test if I need further treatment? I'm a little concerned about going onto an anti-inflammatory and would prefer testing my progression without taking these meds. What have been your experiences to test the progression of your exercise-induced asthma?

Many thanks!"
"Recently moved from one big city to another and my asthma has been out of control. Back in city #1 the air quality is a little better, sure, but it's still just another city with thousands of cars driving around. 

I've been taking my normal controller (Symbicort) for 3 weeks now and it feels like it's barely doing anything, and when I went back to city #1 for a few days to finish the move my symptoms disappeared again, only to come back again hard when I finished my move to city #2. 

I really thought it was due to greater air pollution, but with an AQI of like 30 or so today and my symptoms only getting worse, I started getting desperate. Something clicked and I decided to check my wall AC unit filter only to find that it was basically one giant screen of dust. Cleaned it out and cleaned the rest of the units in my apartment, and fingers crossed that this helps. The AC unit tends to blast in my face while I sleep.

Has anyone had anything similar before, does it sound like this could be the likely culprit? Any other tips for managing my new home environment? One of my roommates has a giant HEPA air filter that we just turned on this morning to try and help."
"I just noticed the directions that it must be stored upright. It‚Äôs been stored on its side for a few months. Is it going to be ok?

I also don‚Äôt want to have to buy a new one if I don‚Äôt need to, because my insurance sucks for inhalers. Thank you!"
"I‚Äôm not sure if anyone has mentioned this before.  I live in a very humid place (in summer) and we have central air conditioning.   The lower the temperature, generally, the better my asthma is.  I was still having a lot of issues and my doctor suggested getting a dehumidifier.   I said we didn‚Äôt need it because we have air conditioning but she said that air conditioning doesn‚Äôt take out the humidity very well.   I was surprised.  

So we bought a dehumidifier- they are not cheap but anything to keep the asthma at bay.   Well, low and behold, it‚Äôs made a huge difference.   I am actually sleeping way better and feel much better in general.  

I just wanted people to know that if humidity bothers you, air conditioning might not be enough."
"my doctor suggested i get the ppsv-23 vaccine since i‚Äôm about to turn 19, i‚Äôve had pneumonia 5 or 6 times so i see why i should get it but is there anyone else here who‚Äôs gotten it? is it worth getting?"

"I am 25 and had mild asthma, the alvesco preventative inhaler is what is prescribed to me and works well for 2 puffs a day when I am on it. 

however, whenever I go through an order I am in hopes that my asthma will be improved and not need this special help anymore. 

For the last 2 years, I have been good for month or 2 after running out and then notice symptoms slowly coming back and having to take my rescue until I call my healthcare provider for a new refill to pickup for Alvesco 

I was wondering if this is bad what I am doing and I should just be on it year round probably right? 

I also am working on cutting out smoking weed, I have a lot of people around me who are always bringing it around and need to learn to start saying no every time because smoke is definitely my trigger and I think giving it up would allow me to heal better."
"28M from EU here, diagnosed at 12 with allergy and sports-induced asthma. For the past few years I‚Äôve lived with a constant asthma trigger, a cat due to my SO being a big pet person, which I agreed to hoping my body would get used to it - it didn‚Äôt. 

My body has gotten used to exercise, which now thankfully no longer triggers a reaction, but as allergy asthma attack just hits different. 

My doctor has put me on the heaviest day-to-day inhaler available here, Relvar 184/22, and has regularly suggested I get rid of the cat since it is it quite literally a constant attack on my airways. 

I wake up every other night around 4 AM going down the stairs seeing spots due to oxygen shortage, using the inhaler and waiting out the attack, which usually takes around 30min. This freaked me out early on but I get weird looks every time I tell a doctor.

Since I‚Äôm approaching my 30s now I‚Äôm starting to get worried about the long term effects of allergies on asthma and I‚Äôm hoping to read some success stories in the comments afterwards.

Overall, I feel like my breathing has gotten a little bit better, but I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm just starting to get used to it and not really improving.

I still feel like I can‚Äôt fully take a deep breath and my inhalers don‚Äôt really help with that. I‚Äôm also yawning a lot more often but they usually come short of a full breath. The odd thing about it is that it really only affects me when I focus on it. Im usually fine throughout the day.

I‚Äôve also realized that my lungs hurt a bit while doing cardio, but my inhaler seems to make that feel better.

I know that the cart wasn‚Äôt fake or laced because all of my friends (4 of them) that smoked the cart had no issues at all

"Hello everyone
I accidentally have taken my medicines through a nebulizer twice without the saline. The doctor prescribed me saline to put in along the medication but I forgot to add it. Felt shakey and had rapid heart beat after usage both of the times

And no I do not have access to any doctor :("
"To explain: I'm really confused. I did see a pulmonologist but he wouldn't confirm my asthma, so I've been seeing my family doctor and she gave me daily Breo to prevent attacks.

"Long story short, as a kid, I was told I had asthma, I didn‚Äôt know if I truly did however when adults tell you that you do, you tend to believe them. I rarely ever took inhalers only when I was sick. I didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúrescue‚Äù inhaler, I didn‚Äôt take it daily, literally only when I had a cold because my parents would give it to me and say it would help me feel better.

After I turned 10, I just stopped using them completely, since then, I‚Äôve done 10km runs, competitive team sports, intense cardio and never once felt like I needed an inhale or couldn‚Äôt breathe.

So, it is time to tackle my Achilles Heel of household tasks... CLEAN THE OVEN üò±

I've been asthmatic since childhood,  and have learned many asthma hacks over the years. I do the obvious things like wear a mask, open windows, and use fans. However,  cleaning the oven remains a monster problem that I have not figured out yet. I have tried so many oven cleaners that advertise as ""asthma friendly"". I know, I know... LOL and eye roll.

"I'm mainly posting this to see if this has affected anyone else. I'm 19 and I have been asthmatic my entire life. Been hospitalised and everything. I take Montelukast and Fostair 200/6 daily to manage my symptoms. Yet... my reliever inhaler has been taken off my repeat prescription. Apparently it is now standard practice in the UK for reliever inhalers not to be repeat and to have to be specifically requested every single time you need them.

This is ridiculous to me for several reasons. 1) I'm literally never going to not be asthmatic. It's a chronic condition. 2) One inhaler lasts me about a month. I can order my preventer every month, but not my reliever?
3) I'm Welsh but I go to university in England. I have to keep switching between GPs (especially due to lockdowns) in England and Wales registering permanently and as a temporary patient to get my medication (I take other things too). Every single time I move home or back to England I have to go through everything again, make an appointment with a GP, which is often weeks away, to ask for my goddamn reliever inhaler. It's so frustrating and honestly makes me want to cry. The last time I was able to order an inhaler was in April. I'm told that the only person who I can discuss putting it back on repeat (so I can actually order it myself) is of a senior position in the practice and constantly fully-booked, so I can't get an appointment.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this at all? I'm so upset and frustrated at the ridiculous hoops I have to jump through to get the medication I need to live."
"Hi everyone.

My partner is asthmatic, and is generally Ok as long as we keep her physical activity to a reasonable level and she has her inhaler when she has an attack.

We live in a rural area, and emergency medical services are generally a 30 minutes response time if you need an ambulance.

Would it be helpful to keep emergency oxygen on-hand in case she has a severe attack? 30 minutes seems like a long time to risk waiting for medical support for a breathing issue.

It looks like the large pressurized metal canisters are regulated items, and require a prescription. However, there are small canisters (""Boost"" brand) available for purchase online.

While I'm skeptical of any health claims they stick on the bottle, oxygen is oxygen, and I would think it would work just fine in the rare event it was needed.

Thoughts?"

"Delta variant.
It's not as bad as getting the 2nd shot. But the sore throat lasted about a week and then there's... diarrhea. Like I feel fine otherwise. I wouldn't have even known I was sick except the sore throat. 
My coworker also got it too and he only experienced a sore throat, tiredness, and dizziness. After a week he was fine.
Another coworker has the Gamma variant and didn't even know he was sick until he got tested because his cousin was sick.

What's it like for people who get through each day without their lungs throwing a hissy fit for literally no reason? Those lucky people who never need to worry if they can make it from their bed to their toilet without needing to call an ambulance because they can no longer breathe effectively, speak or move...
The people who get to use their pto to relax and unwind, instead of using it to cover times of being hospitalised because their lungs were throwing a wobbly. 
What freedom it must feel like to be able to choose any country to live in, and not fear leaving the country where sunshine comes to die for fear of losing the NHS and essentially free healthcare. 
How nice it must be to not worry about making the bills each Month because of needing time off work, to actually sleep without waking up in terror feeling as though you are suffocating and to never have to hear people's stupid opinions on how you can improve your breathing (have you TRIED just breathing/sleeping/losing weight/various dumb diets?!)

Breathing is definitely something the majority of people take for granted, our bodies are programmed to breathe without us even needing to think about it or put any conscious effort in and yet again I'm struggling to achieve this basic thing. Of all the things I could be bad at, did it have to be this?

Thanks for allowing me to vent. I'm just so sick of it and my resp. Consultant saying ""I literally don't know how to help you, I've tried everything"" has left me feeling pretty hopeless. Fork you asthma. That is all."
I had a dr. app the other day and he's pretty sure I have exercise induced asthma. I have to get testing done to confirm but.... I pushed myself the other day while exercising and had a coughing fit. I felt a chest tightness afterwards. Started on Monday and is still lingering. Feels like a bag of bricks is on my chest.  I feel a little better knowing it's probably asthma but is this normal for those of you that do have asthma? Can it linger for days?  I did heart testing and all my vitals looked great.

"Two weeks ago I have been to a doctor which prescribed me a budesonide(corticosteroid) inhaler. I did not have any side  effects until about 2-3 days ago.   
Basically I have a sore throat, and my tongue hurts when I lift it up. I do seem to have a few white spots on tongue ( but I am not sure if it's oral thrush cause my tongue is not that white) I also have an increase in mucus.  
I was wondering if these are normal side effects and if anyone else experienced them.

I do have to mention I did not rinse my mouth as I was not made aware I had to do this after using the inhaler... So is this a possibility those side effects come from the inhaler?"

Ever since I was told I was a child with asthma problems and had one or two asthma attacks only before I even turned 4 years old I always wondered why I did not need an inhaler like ever in my teens or now as an adult.

my asthma starting flaring up badly about three weeks ago and i‚Äôve basically been bed/couch ridden since then because the slightest movement or talking sets me off. i‚Äôm coughing up a storm, i‚Äôm uncomfortable, i can‚Äôt have a proper conversation without running out of air. 
my doctor‚Äôs got me on so many medications and inhalers and i think i‚Äôm finally starting to feel better but i‚Äôm still so frustrated right now. i worked for an hour and a half tonight and felt so exhausted because walking feels like running a marathon. i don‚Äôt get sick leave at my job and i‚Äôve got nearly $1000 worth of debts due in the next couple of weeks so not working isn‚Äôt an option. i haven‚Äôt seen any of my friends in a fortnight because all my energy goes toward work. i just wanna live my life. i don‚Äôt even fully know what triggered the flare. 

does anyone else ever feel like this? what do you do to stay positive?"
"Hey reddit,
I was diagnosed with Asthma in around September 2019. It was originally just like a tickle that would get in my throat and a dry cough, maybe a tiny bit of wheezing and airway inflammation. This seemed like just regular asthma or the common cough variants I see on here. They prescribed me QVAR and Flovent (doubled my dosage for about the first week).       
Symptoms calmed down until around February to March. I lost the tickling feeling in my throat and developed a wet cough. Wet cough became literally my only symptom. It wasn't too bad at first, but it was impairing my abilities to exercise by around June or July, and I went to the doctor again in around December of 2020.     
They prescribed me Advair and Xopenex, as well as Xithromax and Prednisone, apparently just to clear out any buildup. I think the Xithromax and Prednisone did help a lot, it cleared out much of my symptoms and I was able to exercise and laugh almost without any symptoms for a few good months. Recently however, the wet cough has come back, and it has been hitting hard. I've used phlegm removal strategies like huff cough, which is the only reason that I can function during exercise. Despite this, my airways are just always producing mucus and I would end up having to clear my airways out again after a few hours or especially after eating some sort of fast food or sweet, sugary foods.    

In addition, I have developed a sort of nasal drip over the past couple weeks (seasonal allergies were normal for me, so I did not think much of it), and it has been exacerbating my symptoms, I think. Really, I think my asthma has been the worst controlled it has ever been, I have just used huff cough and other breathing techniques to expel mucus often, making it sort of possible to exercise.      

I am contemplating taking the Xithromax (antibiotic) again to see if it will help anything, is that safe? If it doesn't help I'm going back to the doctor. Is there any advice you guys can give me? Am I being misdiagnosed?     

TL;DR: dry cough, regular asthma or cough variant symptoms evolve into just a wet cough within around 6 months of diagnosis (QVAR, Flovent). Wet cough has been with me since around March 2020, and after being prescribed Advair and Xopenex, as well as Xithromax and Prednisone for a few days just to clear up buildup in December, 2020 I felt a few months of no symptoms coming up at all. Since around April 2021, I have been not able to function comfortably, esp. with exercising and laughing. I'm about to take Xithromax again to see if it helps, is it safe to do that? And am I being misdiagnosed? None of my prescriptions have held up long term. Is there any advice anyone can give me?"
"My oxygen levels are fine everytime i check but my throat feels closed up and it takes more effort to take deep breaths but i don't feel like it's gonna get worse than this, should i wait it up or just take my salbutamol? My doctor said ""according to necessity"" but i dont exactly know what that means here.
If it helps it's winter and cold weather tends to triggee allergies."
"Hi all, 32f recently diagnosed with adult onset asthma after a nasty bout of pneumonia. Haven‚Äôt been able to properly catch my breath since mid May, struggling with things like stairs, and talking puffs me out terribly. 

Doctor has prescribed two puffs twice daily of seretide 250/50 (250 micrograms of fluticasone propionate and 25 micrograms of salmeterol) which I‚Äôve been doing for 3 weeks with little improvement. 

All online resources I‚Äôve seen states not to exceed one puff twice a day. Should I be concerned!? 

Thanks! Any advice appreciated"
"Doctor called about the test and told me it‚Äôs very likely to be asthma. I have been suffering from long term breathlessness for a year and have been using controller 
inhaler(beige color) to cope. I have had childhood asthma and last year this issue seems to relapse. I sometimes feel really depressed not being able to do sports or even running like last time. I did not cherish the time where I can breathe properly. Now I get out of breath so easily. 

Will I have to use controller inhaler for the rest of my life? I have heard of it‚Äôs long term side effects. Now I‚Äôm just waiting for the next consultation and feeling worried for the long term. 

I have been covid vaccinated and tested so it‚Äôs rules out"
"Maybe that sounds dramatic. Maybe you understand. Before being prescribed it, I was having multiple asthma attacks a day. Using my rescue up to 4 separate times too many days. I don't think I'd have been able to survive another month. Almost every other night I was having attacks so bad I probably needed the er, but I live alone and couldn't breathe enough to call 911. Thinking back on those nights, I was so lucky I survived. It was terrifying, coughing so violently out of *literally* nowhere while not being able to bring in enough air, making me gag. Agonizing minutes passing just waiting for the rescue inhaler to work, the exhaustion, the *soreness* that comes with particularly bad attacks. Now I'm 3 doses in. There was some improvement after the first, as early as a week after the first I remember realizing I was using my rescue less. The second brought more improvement, but I was getting worried because I wasn't where I wanted to be. But I was using my rescue *maybe* once a week. This 3rd dose though. Now I can tell my shortness of breath this time is from being seriously out of shape. But I could complete a 15 minute HIIT cardio workout! Even better than the first time I tried it before developing this stupid asthma!

I have only needed my inhaler twice in the past 3 weeks. Once because the hood system went out at work filling the whole store with thick greasy smoke and I didn't get my mask on quickly enough, and the second today due to a very high heat and humidity combo. I was able to go to an amusement park with my sister and family and walk around in the heat without needing it. And the most amazing thing is that I just got my lab results back, my eosinophils are at 0!!! There's actual, tangible proof that it is working! I'm actually looking forward to my next lung appointment, my pulm is gonna be so thrilled! He was almost as frustrated as me through this whole thing. He hasn't seen the results yet as they were ordered by my hematologis who works for a different hospital group, so it's gonna be a fun little surprise for him. Or maybe he'll be expecting it. Either way, this is the first bit of good news appointment for my lungs ever. I used to leave his office crying it was so bad. I'm so happy I'll get to leave the next one with a smile."
"Hi all, 33f and it‚Äôs looking like maybe I have allergic asthma or adult onset asthma‚Ä¶either way I am new to feeling like I can‚Äôt breathe even though I know I‚Äôm getting air. It‚Äôs awful, idk how you guys deal. I‚Äôm using albuterol PRN and just started Advair a few days ago. The chest tightness is better, but I‚Äôm still feeling a big wheeze at the end of the inhale (nothing on the exhale though, strange?). I also feel EXHAUSTED‚Ä¶just sapped of energy. If standing, want to be sitting. 

Can you guys tell me like‚Ä¶what‚Äôs normal, what‚Äôs not normal, how long does it take to get relief, what kind of devices or precautions help make it better‚Ä¶? Super uncomfortable here and my anxiety is having a field day üîÑ with this. Thank you!"

"Help!!!  I only go to the office two days a week.  Each of those two days that we have returned a month ago,  I have come home feeling like crap. I think the air may be too dry as the building is a pretty controlled environment.  Any tips or suggestions to get through the day would be great.  I see my pulmonologist Aug 9th so I gotta make it these next two weeks still before he can help me.  It‚Äôs so bad by the time I get home my legs and arms feel weird from what I‚Äôm guessing is lack of oxygen or breathing too fast. I nebulize on my way to the office and at lunch.  Any ideas?  Can the office be too dry?"
"I‚Äôve got asthma as well as bad allergies to dust and pollen etc and find myself with a tight chest in the mornings before I take my inhaler. I noticed this wasn‚Äôt the case when I stayed in America for a 2 week period and had it down to the fact that the room I was in had air conditioning on all the time which had dehumidifying effects (I doubt it would be any other environmental advantages as the house I was staying in had cats which I‚Äôm also allergic to lol). 

Before I bought a dehumidifier I wanted to see if anyone here has one and if yous think it‚Äôs worth buying? Was just gonna pick up a cheap one on Amazon"
"Recently I'd been diagnosed with Asthma. It was a tricky one, because my PFT results were basically useless, because the test was technically flawed every time. I was at a hospital and had bunch of tests. Bronchoscopy revealed signs of chronic inflammation, which could be explained by asthma. With that note I was sent home with Symbicort and Montelukast prescriptions. Since I've been taking the meds I feel improvement. My major symptoms started a month ago. Since then my symptoms are better, but I still suffer from shortness of breath on a daily basis, just with a slight improvement. I've been monitoring my oxygen levels regularly as well. Most days it stays within 95-99% range. Tonight for some reason my oxygen kept dipping way below, lowest being 91%. It does come back up fairly quickly to normal range, but the dips did happen a couple of times occasionally. It really makes me anxious. That plus the fact that medication only helps a little bit. Makes me doubt their diagnosis. Of course I'm not reaching out for a diagnosis on the internet, just merely an opinion from people who experience the disease and whether they can relate to what I'm experiencing."
"Basically, why would one want to take one over the other? Are the oral forms more proactive while the inhaler is reactive, or something like that?

Disclaimer: I realize I can't consider the contributions of the online layperson to be valid medical advice, nor should anyone consider what I say as such. This decision is presumably ultimately up to the prescribing physician."
"Hi my fellow asthma friends. I was wondering if you could share how do you cope with a bad day, week of asthma... I'm exhausted mentally. I have a great pulmonologist, primary care physician and counselor that help me a lot. Plus my family. But some days, are just harder than others. What do you tell yourself when you are having a bad asthma day?"
"So, I've been having some shortness of breath for the past 2.5 months or so, and have been seeing doctors &amp; specialists to try to find out what's wrong. I went to an allergy/asthma specialist and they prescribed Montelukast for me. I haven't been diagnosed with asthma, and they didn't seem to think it was asthma based on my symptoms (shortness of breath that worsens at night, congestion in my lower throat when I wake up, and feeling like my breathing is being restricted). (sidenote: I know I haven't been diagnosed with asthma, but I'm posting on this sub because asthma is what the drug is most commonly used for, so I thought this was appropriate).

I read the side effects and researched online and I'm really nervous to start taking this, and am considering not even starting it at all. I already have bad anxiety, family history of depression, and it's honestly taken a while to get into a good spot mentally. I don't want to mess it up. 

In addition, I lose my health insurance soon and wouldn't be able to pay for this drug without my insurance (even if it works). What do you guys think? Any experiences with this drug?"
"I was just wondering when bronchial spasms come on really slowly over time and i dont catch them fast enough... my entire back will like almost lock up, not the spine but like the muscles of the spine. Then when I use my medication everything just slowly releases and then I eventualy stretch and massage it all as I can reach the muscles. Like even my ribs hurt as everything eventually lets go!

&amp;#x200B;

Is it the chest and back muscles havingto work harder because my lungs are spasiming out or it changes like the way my chest and back move while I am having a bronchial spasm?"
"Hey everyone, the wildfires have been impacting me a lot despite living far away from them. While checking out air quality sites I realized picking up some equipment of my own might be smart. Does anyone else do this? Reviews on Amazon of products do not seem promising. I'm hoping to measure both indoor and outdoor quality, and don't want anything on a subscription model."
"this iss my second post here, on my first i had just gotten diagnosed with asthma and was wondering if the doctors were right. 

it‚Äôs been a few months now and i have some questions 

i keep seeing everyone saying ur not supposed to use albuterol all the time/daily, but why? what health problems can it cause. 

i have albuterol and flovent , the albuterol works great but i have to use it a lot , like several times a day 

the flovent seems to help ? i can‚Äôt really tell, i was using it daily and then i lost it for a week and still did okay just with the albuterol. when i was using it daily it would turn my barking cough into more of a congested normal cough and i only used the albuterol like once a day. it also makes my lungs feel extremely tired towards the end of the 12 hours. 

should i go to the doctor for a different inhaler or something 

also i don‚Äôt think my asthma is allergy related but i was prescribed a high dose allergy med , should i be taking it"
I'm worried because she is too dependent on nebulizer(duolin+beudecort) and it might worsen some day and this medicine won't be as effective. When she catches cold and starts coughing it gets worse. To manage the cough local physician prescribes montair. Are these medicines good or what's the current best management for asthma and coughing ??
"I have asthma and i take a daily inhaler as well as an emergency one and my asthma is worse. I do little things and I‚Äôm suddenly out of breath passing out on the couch. For example I shower, i get out of breathe, i walk up some stairs, out of breathe. It‚Äôs super annoying and so inconvenient, i‚Äôm only 15 + i i always have this pain whenever i walk up stairs included with the loss of breathe. Any tips? i‚Äôm suffering."
"A few weeks ago, I posted asking if anyone thought asking for room accomodations because of my asthma would sound entitled (no one thought that and I appreciate everyone's comments on that post so much). My school finally got the documentation from my allergist and I have a meeting at 10AM EST. I'm a little nervous because people in my life haven't always taken my asthma seriously and I'm worried the OA will be the same. I know that's silly, but I was hoping I could get a little bit of encouragement (or advice if you've been through this).

Thanks so much!!"
"I have been on symbicort after being re-diagnosed with asthma last summer(had it as a kid and it went away)(could be related to covid). However, since I had been waking up unable to breathe, I met with my doctor who prescribed me montelukast sodium 10 mg and generic advair(Wixela 250-50). These medicines have been working great for me on the asthma front as I have not had wheezing or needed to use my rescue inhaler, but I have had burning and tingling sensations on my hands and am constantly ichy everywhere on my body. My skin has also been hot to the touch, my eyes are extremely irritated, and all over and I have been uncomfortable all day. I talked to my doctor about this and he said to first stop taking the montelukast, which I have done. However, I was just wondering if these sorts of reactions are commonplace with these two meds or am I a special case. I also presented these symptoms on symbicort but they were much weaker and more sporadic‚Ä¶ i just want to breathe and not be ichy smh"
When I'm breathing through my nose and out my mouth I'm at 99. Breathing in my mouth and it my mouth I go to 92. What's this a sign of?


"My child was diagnosed with asthma in kindergarten after getting croup multiple times a year from 1 year of age until kindergarten, where he finally got on budesonide (sp?) and then a pulmonologist has him on Flovent HFA twice at night.
I‚Äôve noticed for awhile, he always has this cough. He never says it hurts or anything but he‚Äôs self conscious of it especially out in public..


He hasn‚Äôt had an asthmatic episode in years since being on Flovent and us moving to Florida (they came to the conclusion the drastic change in weather caused episodes)

Does anyone else just have a cough?

Thanks for any input, no one else in our family has asthma. Or at least has been diagnosed with asthma."
"I‚Äôm trying to determine if I‚Äôm sick or if it‚Äôs the advair??

I started having issues with my asthma because of increased pollen a few weeks ago but I wasn‚Äôt really coughing, just shortness of breath and feeling like I couldn‚Äôt take a deep one. Talked to dr and she told me to start using advair along with singulair pills. 

Used inhaler this morning and now left side of my chest hurts a little and I‚Äôm coughing and I cannot tell if it‚Äôs the advair and this is normal or if I should call my dr tomorrow and see if it‚Äôs something else."
"I had been living an asthma attack free life for the longest time. Probably around 10 years. Then, suddenly my asthma got worse and I waited so long to increase my dosage, so it got out of control. My dosage is increased, and its getting back in control, but Im still not recovered yet.

But its crazy, because, before, I was really kicking ass in life. I'm a young dude but every day, I was pushing boundaries, chasing the money, going to school, chasing fitness etc. I was living the young adult life.

But ever since this asthma flare happened, I feel so weak. I feel that ""adult"" part of me vanished, and I'm a small vulnerable 6 year old child again. A 6 year old child in an adult body. My willpower to chase my dreams and shit went out the window. I'm not longer an adult. I'm a kid. A dependent."

"I've not been able to get out to get another. it's not really been that big of a deal over the past couple days but holy shit, tonight is the worst it's been in years. it's 11pm and I can't even begin to sleep because all of my energy is going into not dying of a damn oxygen deficiency lol"
"I‚Äôm really anxious and would love to have some reassurance/support from you. I had mild flu and since then my asthma symptoms (shortness of breath and mucus in throat) have increased, and the asthma medication haven‚Äôt helped yet properly. It would seem like an obvious asthma worsening - and I‚Äôm still scared that I have a pulmonary embolism and that I‚Äôm gonna die to it.

Is there anyone else, who suffers from health anxiety and asthma? How could I calm myself that it‚Äôs just probably my asthma and not pulmonary embolism? I‚Äôm scared to go to sleep :("

"A year ago, I had an asthma attack or so I thought but I'm still not sure. I was generating more saliva than usual and had to spit it out even when I was sleeping, was I having an asthma attack? Or was it a dust mite allergy?"
"I am struggling in the past week or so, but today is worse. And then I have the dreaded fear of covid in the back of my mind. With having asthma can covid be much worse for us? I am not vaccinated as with my other health issues it wasn't recommended yet.  But I work full time at home now for 3 years and my groceries are delivered since the pandemic started. I also mask up if I do get out (very little) and always have sanitizer and wash my hands well. But yesterday after eating I felt a irritation in my nose and down my throat on the left side and today my breathing is so off. It feels hard to inhale some but the exhale is BAD. I think I just need someone to help me feel okay? I know that sounds weird.. just scared and I hate feeling off in times like this. If covid wasn't even a thing I wouldn't be second guessing EVERYTHING. I was diagnosed with asthma back in February based on a single PFT showing mild obstruction, but I am not sure how MILD (one point off) can make my breathing feel SO bad at times. Any tips? Advice? I do have GERD and have felt some acid reflux lately.. but anything rational right now doesn't make sense to me.. I am in a fear state."
"So I've had a sort of chest tightness and thick phlegm for like 2 years now, and I'm just now going to doctors. The tightness occurs regardless of allergens, and I'v never had any wheezing/coughing. I only get the tightness on the left side of my chest, is that a common thing for asthma? or is it more likely to be a heart thing? I know a lot of the symptoms can be the same between lung and heart conditions. I've had an x-ray, and everything looks fine, just trying to figure out if I should go to a cardiologist or a pulmonologist first. Thanks."

"I finally caved and went back on the Symbicort. The doctors and insurance still haven‚Äôt worked out a way to change my prescription. 

Yesterday was the worst and all I could do was call myself names. I‚Äôm such a dumbass for quitting a medication before going on a new one. 

My lungs still hurt a lot and I‚Äôm still in duress. I feel like I‚Äôve been punched in the ribs a few times and I‚Äôm wearing a corset that‚Äôs too tight. If I‚Äôm not over it by tomorrow I‚Äôll go see a doctor. I have everything I need here, Albuteral and a nebulizer, just not sure if I need the devil pills - prednisone.

I did this to myself so I don‚Äôt need pity just wanted to share, don‚Äôt stop your medication before getting the new medication. It‚Äôs a horrible experience."
i have covid and pretty much have no other symptoms other than lung pain &amp; shortness of breath. i take my nebulizer every 6 hours and it helps a bit. My lungs were checked today and they said my oxygen levels are normal. Using an essential oil diffuser with lavender seems to help me a bit aswell. Does anyone have other tips or anything that could help? i know alot of you on here don't believe in herbal remedies or any of that stuff but i'm just trying to find relief. please be kind.
I need an actuator for this [metered albuterol inhaler](https://pharmacy.amazon.com/Albuterol-Generic-ProAir-Metered-Inhaler/dp/B084689JTB?ref=sr_1_4&amp;keywords=albuterol&amp;qid=1627423323&amp;sr=8-4) but I cannot for the life of me figure out where to get one. Any ideas?
I‚Äôm 15M and just took a peak flow test at the doctors today. When the nurse gave the tester to me and I did what I thought was correct. I got 350 and that seems low. So I googled it and it is low. I think I messed it up. I see on google you‚Äôre supposed to blow out and I what I just did was breathed out really hard. I‚Äôm wondering if that messed it up. I mean I don‚Äôt really know if I have asthma or not
"I live in the Northeast US and even here, we're being affected by the wildfire smoke. It smells like fire outside, looks hazy when it's not. I'm forever grateful we have no fires in our area and it makes me wonder how people with asthma and other breathing difficulties handle being even closer. (We actually have an air quality warning going on) It's bad enough that I left work early yesterday and am in the midst of a bit of a flare up. I've just re-started Symbicort because Flovent wasn't cutting it this time of year, I take daily Zyrtec and hydroxyzine at bedtime. I do not do a nasal spray because they don't agree with me. I've also begun wearing a mask outside to see if it helps or not and do not have any open windows. I'm supposed to do a moderate hike this weekend, but my hiking buddy is understanding about the possibility of rescheduling. 

Am I missing anything? Or is this probably as good as I'll get it for the time being?"
"I know a lot of people may be out there saying ""My preventers don't work! Help!"" and while a small subset of those statements may be true, I suspect a good amount of people aren't practicing proper inhaler technique.

For instance Are you:

1. Using a mouthpiece spacer, instead of a face mask spacer? (those are much better and more effective, hence why its recommended you switch to it ASAP.)
2. Making a tight seal around the mouthpiece of the spacer?
3. Inhaling within 3-5 seconds completely after you press your inhaler?
4. Exhaling completely before you breathe in?
5. Taking a relative constant airflow, with a constant velocity when breathing in, rather than going too fast or too slow in the beginning? (If you struggle with this or point 3, I suggest you practice when you are free with your spacer, just without actually pressing the inhaler.
6. Making sure you hold your breath after you are done inhaling for as long as possible?
7. Washing your spacers every week?
8. Replacing your spacers annually?

Im sure there are more points that I may have forgot, but I strongly suggest you watch those ""How to use an inhaler with mouthpiece spacer"" videos on youtube. They were really helpful for me. I actually just recently made the switch from no spacer to mouthpiece spacer, and it took me a while to get all these points down, hence why I am making this post."
"Hey, 26 female here. Been smoking for about 11 years. Quit cigarettes 8 days ago and not looking back. About 4 months ago I started having tightness in my chest followed by breathlessness when doing normal daily life activities. It almost came out of nowhere. Talked to my GP which gave me Salamol blue inhaler and told me to get help with anxiety. I did just as I was told. Started taking sertaline and inhaler. Inhaler doesn't relief my symptoms at all (I'm using it correct way with spacer). It feels like there's no space in my lungs. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse but the heaviness in my chest is constant 24/7. Sometimes I cough but there's no mucus although I wake up every morning with stuffed nose that goes away after leaving my bed. The breathing feels restricted both inhaling and exhaling, it's almost like there's no space to exhale and I need to force exhale which makes next breath even heavier. Last week went to urgent care as my throat and chest felt very tight but no wheezing. Oxygen levels are perfect, blood is good, no alpha 1 deficiency but doctor spotted hyperinflated lungs on x-ray. Told me it's probably COPD. That was 8 days ago. I'm crushed. Next day I felt even worse, went to urgent care again, another x-ray later another doctor tells me I don't have hyperinflated lungs and that my ribs are just small. Anxiety, he says. I threw my cigarettes away for life, but vape occasionally just to kill my withdrawals but will stop in a week or two. Currently I'm waiting for a spirometry test and cardiologist but it will probably take months and months of waiting. Everyday it feels like I'm breathless through a straw and have an elephant sitting on my chest. Waiting for diagnosis is killing me. Can someone relate to this? I'm open for conversation."


"I'm seeing a lot of people talk about exercise induced asthma on this sub, but I always thought that taking your preventers would stop all sorts of asthma right?

"I am in pretty good shape at 14, 6‚Äô6 205 and constantly working out, and I am on the varsity basketball team.  I have really never had an issue with my asthma until about January, I don‚Äôt know if this is the reason but in January I had an allergic reaction and since then I‚Äôve been very anxious whenever I eat out. Could this stress be causing my asthma to be worse.  And my asthma is really only happening at night and maybe when I do lots of cardio."
"Heya all! I was recently (last year) diagnosed with asthma at age 25 and prescribed Symbicort. It's been amazing so far, but this is the second inhaler I've gotten that's started to leak/spit out the white powder. The first time I happened I didn't know what to do, I had about 30 doses left... I didn't inhale much and rinsed my mouth out good, waited about 30 minutes to see if anything negative happened, then decided to put that one aside and get a fresh inhaler from the pharmacy. Well it's happened to me again now, nice big breath of choking powder with ~50 doses left. I can turn it upside down and shake, and a good quantity of the powder still shakes out in large-ish flakes. I only took one inhalation of that and immediately rinsed my mouth out good.

Does anyone know what's going on? I've tried looking it up but come up blank. I've been meaning to ask my pharmacist but keep forgetting (thanks ADHD). Can I keep using this one? I desperately can't afford the $140 for a new one until later this week, and don't know if I'll be able to survive until then.

Help?"
"Hey everyone, I just came back from the hospital after having severe breathing issues for a couple of days. Turns out I have asthma and this was the first time I had an asthma attack. Now I am a frequent user of basically anything except for the extremely hard drugs like heroin, meth, base coke, things like that. So I did some research and they basically discommend using anything in combination with asthma medication, but I was wondering there must be some drugs I'm still able to use without taking a big risk, because let's be honest, on google they discommend using anything at all. So to be clear is there a possibility that I can still use some drugs by maybe taking some precautions to be safe? The substances I'm interested in are weed, lsd, xtc, 2cb, coke, speed and alcohol. The medicines I got prescribed are Ventolin 100MCG/D which I can use up to 4 times a day and Fluticasone Propionate 250MCG/D which I have to take 2 times a day, morning and evening. I know I should take it slow for the first couple of weeks and I will because I'm still not feeling 100% okay, but I'm just curious because I do want to know what the risks are.
Btw I'm also a cigarette smoker, but I was already planning on quitting at the end of the month so that's not a big deal, the earlier the better."
Anyone not experience coughing w there asthma I find I always clear my throat or swallow a lot?
"Dont you just love the days your asthma decides to set off for no reason!

We're currently having a heatwave where I am, and have for 2 weeks in which I have been fine, but now, at 1am on a weekdays, my asthma decided its the best time to narrowly airways. I took my preventer inhaler and haven't done anything different!"
"I know you're all smarter than this, but I also know the temptation to just experiment freely can be really strong sometimes. My fiance's stupid drug-experimenting friend laced their weed with dmt. If you've ever heard of ayahuasca or the hallucinating ceremonies in South America, that's what I'm talking about. The reason the natives make a drink from it is because they're not stupid enough to smoke that shit. It produces a thick, extremely irritating smoke that can induce a severe asthma attack.

I know my fiance made a stupid mistake that cost him his life. I just wanted to warn any of you who might be tempted to try it. If you're the kind of person whose asthma can handle smoking weed and you do it regularly, please don't let anyone lead you to think lacing it with dmt will be okay as well. He just wanted to be normal and able to trust his body to handle a few irritants here and there, but this one was too much. Take care of yourself and just be careful. Get used to edibles and stop damaging your lungs. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled asthma has a cumulative effect on your body. Even though he was starting to manage his asthma well in the end, the years of smoking cigarettes and indulging in smoking weed didn't help him as his body succumbed to the dmt irritation."
"The doctors think that inflammatory changes in my airways led to me developing asthma.

&amp;#x200B;

I took my rescue inhaler to the pharmisist and he took one look at it and told me it need to be cleaned... no wonder it basicly wasnt working for a week.

&amp;#x200B;

So I take symbicort 2 puffs twice a day. They have upped my rescue inhalier subutamal to 4 puffs every     

4 - 6 hours as needed... now that its actually clean it makes a big difference. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am getting kind of tired of the doctors and respretory therapists not telling me what it is... they just ordered a lung CT scan and said ""inflammitory changes in the lungs""

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea what this means... I have no idea if it can go away. They are saying I ""probably had a upper respretory track infection"" ""probably sinitus"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I have allways needed my rescue puffer my entire life since I was like 12, but it was only like 2 puffs with no chamber like once a year. I am 29 now, again getting real sick and tired of the doctors not telling me wtf is even going on."
"I‚Äôm having a mild flu (not covid-19) and because of that my asthma symptoms have increased - mild shortness of breath for example. My doctor adviced me to take 3 doses of Innovair (combination inhaler) instead of two, 2 times a day. I also have used my salbumatol rescue inhaler daily. 

I don‚Äôt have problems with my heart beat with the ‚Äùnormal‚Äù doses, but today my heart beat has been over 100 all the time. I should use the increased dose for a week now. Is that high heart beat dangerous or just annoying? I‚Äôm kinda scared :("

"Some days I get these awful coughing spells in the mornings, usually before and after I shower. It's most common during the spring and fall, but it can happen any time of the year. It's been happening daily for the last couple weeks. 

20 years ago when I worked the graveyard shift and I walked home in the morning, I'd get the same coughing spells just walking down the street shortly after dawn.

There's nothing special coming up when I cough.

I don't smoke.

I don't drink very often.

I take reactine daily because I own a cat, but she's never made me cough.

What say you, Reddit?"
"With the economic collapse in my country, ventoline is short and at times unavailable. I managed to find an alternative called seraflo but I was hoping someone could tell me the difference? I used to dose ventoline twice when my asthma was acting up. Not sure how this compares, thank you."

"Hello , 
I have mild - intermittent asthma . I take advair everyday . I noticed the last week it seems after I sleep at night and I take a deep breath my throat / chest burns and my upper back if I take a deep breath and after . Idk if it‚Äôs because my breathing is shallow while I sleep I don‚Äôt know . It goes away after a whike . What could this he ?"
"I just received my second xolair injection, and I'm wondering how long they took yall to start working, and what differences you noticed. I'm also on 2 control inhalers, Singulair, and allergy medication. I am anxiously awaiting improvement in my lung function so I can begin immunotherapy, so I'm wondering what everyone else's experiences are with xolair."
Is any ones asthma getting worse because of the humidity?

"I finally decided I really do need a long term inhaler again. I haven‚Äôt used my short term inhaler at all because I haven‚Äôt needed it. Then yesterday we went to the  the farmers market, walked up a hill and I got so winded. It was awful. It wasn‚Äôt something that I can fix with constant exercise it was something that I need medicine for. 

Fast forward to last night and I started digging around the internet. I discovered the difference between Breo Ellipta and Symbicort is Fluticasone/Salmeterol and Budesonide / Formoterol.

If I can get the insurance to approve another long term inhaler that is not Budesonide / Formoterol then I will go back on them. Well I‚Äôll have to or I‚Äôll be stuck in this recliner forever. 

I‚Äôm just so mad that the insurance is still giving me grief over this. I hate it so much. I‚Äôm not rich and have to depend on my husband‚Äôs insurance. It sucks. I mean I‚Äôm thankful we have it. I‚Äôm just mad. 

Thanks for listening."
"Hi everyone. 

I recently discovered that I might have asthma (although the doctor is still unsure, my lung capacity is 70%, no allergies just shortness of breath). I was put on a treatment to see whether it‚Äôs gonna work for me or not. My treatment is Fostair inhaler, twice a day for three months before the next examination. It‚Äôs been 10 days of taking it and there are days where I breath better and there are days where I‚Äôm back to square zero, and actually have to use a reliever (blue inhaler). 

If you‚Äôre taking this or similar inhaler, how soon did you start noticing positive effects? Right away or a few weeks later? What is your experience with Fostair overall? I‚Äôm getting a bit anxious."
"I assumed I had asthma all along but because no inhaler seemed to work, my doctor thinks the high pitch exhaling that I have is called stridor. Has anybody else been diagnosed with stridor and if so how did u get it treated?"

"I seem to have a permanent chesty, productive cough (started about 3 years ago), made worse when I cough. Just wondered if anyone else experiences this?"
"I'm not completely sure, but I think this all started about the time I switched from Seretide to Flutiform. Anyone else had this?"
I've had asthma virtually all my life and I've been on the same medicines for as long as I can remember. Currently I have everything but my Advair and holy crap I feel like a fish out of water! I don't have insurance so how can I get a prescription without having to pay upfront?

"I was wondering if anyone else started experiencing sleep paralysis or really bad nightmares after they started using a preventer inhaler. 
I'm not sure if they are related but this started only after my newly diagnosed asthma."
"ive been diagnosed with cough variant asthma since i was 9, but i stopped taking my inhalers completely until i started getting bad symptoms again a few months ago and went back on my inhalers. so like, i went maybe a decade of not taking any inhalers.

im taking qvar right now and im on my second refill and it felt like after the first inhaler i was feeling great, my cough was almost completely suppressed. then i got my second refill and it just feels like i got worse, and it feels like im sucking on an empty inhaler though it says its full. now my albuterol is starting to feel like its empty despite still being on my first one. i dont taste any of the medicine going in nor do i taste it on my breath when i exhale. on the qvar i feel the air coming through the vents of the inhaler when i inhale, but it just doesnt feel like its enough medicine. 

ive primed them correctly and i make sure to reprime the albuterol after a few days of not taking it as directed. this isnt normal right? should i talk to my doctor or a pharmacist?"
"Anyone else struggling with asthma thanks to the dust? 

Funny thing is I don't remember struggling when it's around before.  That could be selective memory too...."
"Why is it that because I don't consistently wheeze ALL THE TIME, some doctors think I don't have asthma? Or that I couldn't possibly have an asthma attack? Or that I don't need treatment despite struggling to speak or walk, low peak flow (\~40% of my personal best), etc.  Or the fact I have MH issues means that all the asthma attacks are actually panic attacks in their view - despite the fact I'm not panicking (and I know the difference...lol). Or like when I was severely unwell asthma wise they were more interested in getting a COVID swab when I my head was in my lap whilst I was sitting cross legged because I was too weak to move (severe hypophosphatemia and hypokalaemia is rough af) and unable to breathe or speak or do really anything.

You guys had any weird issues getting help for your asthma?"
"Hey there,

i have wheezing nearly all the time and it doesn't go away. I used different inhalers every day in the morning and in the evening. I never had an attack or other symptoms like coughing. Just this wheezing. I smoked 2 years but it doesn't go away, even when I didn't smoke for months."
"I have relatively mild to moderate asthma. Only main symptoms are dyspnea, some wheezing and post nasal drip. Yesterday I woke up in the middle of the night without being able to breathe. It seems a big chunk of mucus/phlegm clogged my throat. I got scared because I spent a considerable amount of time trying to take a breath without being able to. After a while, I drank water and coughed enough that my throat unclogged and it was as if never had happened. 

Has something like this happened to you? What advice would you give me if something like this happens again? Any preventable measures you can recommend?"

"So I just moved to a house that doesnt have an air conditioner.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a little portable dehumidifier that I can use in my room. It was to hot to go to sleep last night so I left the exterior door off my room open and didnt realize the humidity got up to 95% at night so my dehumidifier did nothing... used my maitenence puffer after thinking to myself ""maybe I should use my rescue puffer first?"" anyways... just used my rescue puffer with the spacer and the maitience puffer again and it got better.

&amp;#x200B;

But now... the humidity is 77% outside and I dont have any options to dehumidify the rest of the house, other than closing all the windows and turning the propane furance on to get the humidity down... seeing as I dont want to be stuck in my tiny little bedroom all day what are my options?

&amp;#x200B;

I suppost I could move my portable dehumidifier upstairs to the living room and close all the windows... but it would take some time for the humidity levels to come down. Would my rescue puffer (subutumal) and maitience puffer bought me enough time to wait until the dehumidifier gets the humidity down in the living room, or am i stuck in my room for today?"
"So I was with some friends last night (we meet every few months pre covid) and after an hour or so my chest started to become really tight, had to cough that felt a bit phlegmy too. I thought it was my anxiety and costochondritis. But I think it was because I was laughing so much? 

I realized each time I see them my chest gets this way (they're really funny so we literally laugh the entire night). I just tried to relax and didn't take my Ventolin (probably should have? I have this weird anxiety where I think ""if I take a Ventolin that means my asthma is getting worse and my medicine won't work""). Anyway this morning, I took my morning fostair but I'm actually still a bit phlegmy and my chest feels slightly sore, is it from laughing? It's now made me feel anxious about any further meetups too üòû

Background, I haven't had an asthma attack since starting Xolair over a decade ago, lowest dose Fostair twice day, I take 2 puffs of Ventolin at most once a month but usually every few months, so we'll controlled. I have health anxiety and costochondritis"
"Hi,
I was recently diagnosed with Asthma and put on Fostair as preventer and Salbutamol as reliever. I take Fostair as perscribed in the morning and in the evening, however I noticed that I'm taking my Salbutamol inhaler about twice a day, sometimes more often, depending on what I'm doing (mostly during exercise and when I notice a wheeze coming on). 
What's weird is that I do sometimes get symptoms  seemingly out of nowhere. I have no allergies that I know of. 
Has anyone here experienced the same?"
"I went to an asthma specialist last month and she switched me over to a preventative asthma inhaler, and I have not used any rescue medication for a month now! I am extremely grateful to be able to breathe and work out without any attacks :D"
"I had really bad asthma growing up and over time i learned what to avoid to not have an attack, sports, and just being outside in general. Ive moved to only needing my rescue mabey once a year. And havent had a major attack since i was younger. 
Ohhh boy am i stupid. 
I went home for lunch to let the dogs out to and back i had the windows down in my car and even played with the dogs in the back yard for a bit. While driving home i noticed the haze in the distance and didnt think any thing of it. I got back to work and about 15 mins later it started, i though oh im just congested let cough it out. Nothing came out, then the difficultly breathing started. Like a moron üôÑ  i had my rescue inhaler at home. So i ran back home while trying to keep my breath even and not panic. Got home and took it, it worked for about 30 mins then my lungs decided to say meh fuck you. 
Cue to my husband taking me to a urgent care to get a breathing treatment. Only to find out they dont do that anymore because of covid. So on to the er for a breathing treatment.... 
We get there and they treat me for an anxiety attack, and will see if i need a breathing treatment. So finally after a hour they get me it and you know what i can breathe again. 
It was a weird episode, even with my nose and lung clear it felt like i wasnt getting oxygen to my lungs. Eventhough i knew i was, it was like only 3/4 of it was being retained. And that my lungs couldnt fully expand untill after the treatment. 
So i get to have a nice bill since i threw away my old machine, and get to make a doc apt to get a new one. Wild fire haze is no joke, i will definitely be wearing a mask when i go out side now till it out of my area. 
So guys learn from me, even if your an adult and havent had an full on attack in a long time, keep your machines and emergency inhalers up to date. And this had nothing to do with covid, vaccinated and test was neg."
"Hi, I just got diagnosed with asthma (had it for awhile but finally got to the doctor) and they prescribed me a powder inhaler and a rescue inhaler. I'm confused of the point of the powder inhaler. He said it will help me over time breathe better and not have to use the rescue as much, but doesn't that mean I'd have to stay on the powder inhaler forever? Also, I'm scared the medicine could lower my immune system and curious about other experiences.

"I just had to go to the hospital today from an asthma attack does anyone have any tips for calming down asthma I use inhaler/nebulizer but it‚Äôs not really working for me and I don‚Äôt want to go back to the hospital (I‚Äôm seeing a asthma specialist soon but in the mean time idk what to do, asking for a friend üò≠)"

"22 M 
I take my brown steroid inhaler once on a morning and once on a night. It‚Äôs usually fine during the day and sometimes flares up a little on a night. However. This past week I‚Äôve had quite a lot of coughing spells and my chest seems tight quite abit. This week in the UK has been really hot. Could this hot weather have something to do with it maybe ? 
Also I tested negative for COVID on Tuesday so I know it‚Äôs not that"
"I have had asthma since I was a child and over the years it has fluctuated in severity. I can usually control using Breo, Singulair and a rescue inhaler. My asthma started to get worse in October 2020 and in November I was diagnosed with Covid. I went into isolation but found my breathing to be shallow and painful. I was down for two weeks and finally started to get better.

What I have noticed since the is that my lungs are always sore and breathing is always more difficult. I have asthma that keeps me awake nearly every night although I am taking the same medicines. I had hoped this would go away, but it‚Äôs been nearly 8 months and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be getting better. I get winded doing just about anything. I‚Äôm 6 feet and weigh 200 pounds so I could lose some weight I don‚Äôt think my weight has that much to do with my trouble breathing.

Has anyone else experienced breathing issues out of the ordinary since contracting Covid?"
"Hi everybody, has anyone looked into stem cell treatment for asthma? It looks really promising! Let me know your thoughts!"
"I have to use my Ventolin fairly often compared to in the past due to various reasons, but my question is mainly should I be worrying if I have to use it maybe 3-4 times a day? I also use Symbicort at morning and night (usually), which tends to help maintain my symptoms. Whenever I use the Ventolin it stops my attacks, but it is more often than I‚Äôm used too. Anyone have experience with this?"
"[This is my spacer](https://imgur.com/a/vPRzjIX). I tried for several minutes to press and pop the little tabs to get the end off. No luck. 

A little googling brought up [this video](https://youtu.be/0hn0xkEA6a8) on how to clean what appears to be the same spacer. But I've messed around with it a lot now, and nothing at that end twists (except the flipcap itself). 

Help? Most of the results when I searched for how to take it apart actually didn't cover taking it apart at all, and only talked about how to use dish soap to clean it."



"I've been on my nebulizer ever four hours for the past 24 hours due to an asthma flare up. For some reason, for about an hour or two after taking my nebulizer, I've had a stutter and speech in general is just difficult. Has anyone else had this problem before?"


"Hi, quick question to anyone who developed tachycardia after using symbicort, how long did it take for the symptoms to go away after you stoped using it?  I was only on it for 10 days, but my heart rate is doing all kinds of scary crazy things now.  Now last puff was Saturday morning."
I think it's because I'm sleeping really really well these days. I'm so happy. Feel like I'm 16 again.
Am I supposed to take 1 or 2 puffs of albuterol for each dosage??
"First time doing it this evening

On average what numbers are a good or bad reading? I blew 250 this evening.


Do you guys have any tips?"
"I‚Äôve been having a really bad asthma flare up over the last week and finally went to emergency last night when my cough got worse, I was struggling to breathe and getting minimal to no relief from my inhalers. I got given some airway opening drugs and now my breathing is much better but this cough is still hanging around and driving me mad. Emergency doc said it probably won‚Äôt be gone for another week.
Does anyone have any tips on if and how to relieve this at least a little bit? I can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôm going insane."

"Hello folks! I've known my husband for about 12 years years, been together for almost 7 years. I've always known he's had ""very bad"" asthma, but our living conditions have changed recently and it's aggravated his asthma so badly, I'm struggling to understand.

I have asthma too (according to my doctor when I was 7), but it's pretty mild. I have a light pain in my chest fairly constantly, my lung capacity is trash, and I get tired easily. I can't talk and walk at the same time; if I do it for too long, my breathing becomes super labored and audible. Phone calls while walking quickly are pretty much impossible; no one can understand what I say I'm between my huffing and wheezing. But I don't use any medications - I've had distinct asthma attacks maybe twice ever, and both times I just went outside and sat, and did some controlled breathing with fresh air. It hurt and I cried, but after a few minutes, I got myself back up and functioning.

But according to my husband, his asthma is much worse, and I just don't understand. He's able to exhale for much longer than I am, so I figured he must have great lung capacity? But he uses up his albuterol sulfate inhalers too quickly. With some irritants at home and a relatively sedentary l lifestyle (Covid - he was very active prior), he's using up an entire inhaler thing within two weeks, but he can only pick up refills once a month. So now with our current situation, he's trying so many things to supposedly help. ""Breathe easy"" tea, a canister of 95% oxygen to breathe from, a peppermint oil + menthol supplement. The tea didn't seem to help much last year, and the other two things mentioned haven't arrived yet, but he's also ordered other things to try.

I do most of our research and finances, so I'm trying to find a way to help him. **So I guess what I'm asking is actually two things - how can I understand my husband's asthma better, and how can I help him?**"
"I just want to know, if anyone else has been on a high dose of ICS, have you all had experience with this? How are your bones and eyes doing?"
"Hi Everyone, 

Mild asthma here. Most times an infrequent rescue inhaler and allergy meds are fine for my symptoms. 

My area is under a smoke warning for the next 48 hours. I'm not familiar with handling this as where I live doesn't often get warnings like this.

Other than staying inside, living in AC, 2 a day inhalers (what I need to manage symptoms right now) and staying very on top of allergy meds- do you all have any suggestions to make this next little bit survivable? Currently contending with significantly congested sinuses even after allergy meds. Was considering something like mucinex to help but not even sure it would be effective. Wondering at what point I should stop self managing and go to a doctor for more ideas.

Thanks!"
"Hi everyone, 
I just got diagnosed with mild asthma today. I have trouble breathing on walks, doing physical exercise outside, or when the air is really humid, but nothing that would take me to the hospital. I usually just rest for a bit and it goes back to normal. My doctor recommended I just use salbutamol as needed, and if it gets worse to come back and see him. Does anybody have any thoughts or recommendations?"
"Are you all ""going back to normal"", or are you continuing to be cautious? If anyone has resources about how covid and the delta variant might affect asthmatics, that would be greatly appreciated! I've been extremely careful this entire pandemic, and am a bit devastated to hear about the delta variant potentially being able to breakthrough vaccinated folks.

&amp;#x200B;

ALso, I'm very confused about one thing... If an asthmatic were to get covid, would they probably have similar symptoms as a very bad flu/cold right? I guess it depends on what level of asthma you have... My asthma only occurs when I get a cold/flu which sometimes turns into bronchitis... with an extremely loud cough and lingers for a month even after the sickness is over. I never use an inhaler unless I'm sick, but I've been told I've had asthma my entire life."

Is this still gunk from that or is this just something with asthma? I am still new to asthma and was just diagnosed in Feb hence my quitting time.

"I got diagnosed with non-allergic non-esoniphilic asthma back in April.

But that's just some background, I'm here to ask, am I the only one who notices an improvement in symptoms while lifting weights? I've noticed while lifting weights my nose breathing improves and I feel much more open in my lungs and significantly less symptomatic. I can't find anything about this online, just about exercise causing asthma symptoms not relieving them. Does this sound like something that is experienced in asthma or is it just me?"

I'm trying to return to work in a hospital but a problem is having to use hand sanitizer after touching every surface (20+ times in a hour) will have been coughing and vomiting.

I am attempting to get a desk job, so I don't think that would require as much hand washing at all compared to floor nursing. Occupational health is arguing with me though that they can't accommodate that. I have a asthma clinic referral in, just waiting for help to control the severity of it.

I am also proposing if I have to wash my hands more than a few times per hour I can just use hand soap unscented. It doesn't aerosolize as much at all, very tolerable.

Anyone have any advice?"

"I've been on ventolin for about 15 months now with success, but I just got a refill and it somehow got switched to the Cipla generic of proventil.  I've heard a lot about different inhalers working differently for people, and to be honest I have a lot of health anxiety so taking a ""new"" drug from a manufacturer I'm not familiar with does scare me a bit (even though I know that's not logical).

I have found that elevated ozone levels are a big trigger for me. I have my office at home and keep the central air/air filtration going all the time.

Being in that state for about 5 hours, I searched for home remedies that can cure asthma. I read that consuming caffeine can reduce the cause, so I took two tea bags of green tea and dipped it in boiling hot water in a cup, and after drinking that, I actually got a significant relief and I was completely fine within an hour. I don't know if this works for everyone but this was really astonishing for me to see that green tea can drastically improve my condition."

" So a little backstory im M16 265lbs. And this recent spring break I went on a trip to Arkansas for about a week and on the last day I woke up sick because I left the fan on and fell asleep in a wet shirt. I had first thought it was covid because I couldn't taste anything that morning, but after taking a hot shower I could smell the soap so that was a relief. Long story short as we went to the airport and took the plane back to Georgia I ended up in the hospital because it progressively got worse to where even standing took all my energy so I ended up in the hospital after falling down the stairs from exhaustion. Turns out I've had asthma all my life the cold just triggered an attack. So after a week in the hospital, I left with about 10 steroid pills a Qvar pump, and albuterol. 

The thing is non of that helped I felt the same ever since I left the hospital and that's about 50%of my breath and stamina from before. I play sports, so I thought it would be better, but schools coming around and it feels worse like I can't run 20 yds without having to take a minute break. I know im overweight and that's a big factor but still, this feels much different than just being out of shape I literally can get no oxygen when exercising. The Only exercise I can do is weight lifting.

&amp;#x200B;

All I need to know is that is this normal and if it's not how can I fix it in a relatively short time cause other people I now have asthma and they can still play sports fine.

&amp;#x200B;

ps. I've already lost about 15lbs and sorry for the bad grammar I was rushing typing this."
"Close to a year now I have had certain symptoms, like a constant, odd feeling in my chest.. it could be described as a tightness, combined with the constant slight urge to cough, without actively doing it a whole lot. 

I have read that the symptoms of asthma include chest tightness, but I don't really have anyone I could ask.. is that a feeling you have all the time, or only before or during attacks or in high intensity situations? 

My doctor said it \*could\* be asthma and prescribed me a long-term asthma medication, however this feeling in my chest does never really go away, it's always there in varying intensities. Is that something that still fits to asthma, does it feel like that to you as well?

Thank you!!!"
"Greetings!

I would like to share the story of my health issues for the past 4 years. My problems started 4 years ago at age 38. I used to be a cigarette smoker earlier in life, not very heavy, and stopped completely by age 34 or so. However, I used to smoke cannabis almost every evening at that time and I think my current condition has something to do with it. It was always uncomfortable to smoke for my throat and lungs, however I never had any longer lasting issues at all. I used just a simple short pipe to smoke weed and later I have realized it was quite dirty as I wasn't very good about cleaning it at all. After one session, it felt somewhat worse that usual. The next day I started feeling some tightness and wheezing. This was going on for some time (I have significantly reduced my smoking as it didn't feel right), and after a few weeks I eventually caught a cold that developed into really bad bronchitis. And this bronchitis just would go away. Even after the worst of it subsided, I was still coughing up phlegm every 5 minutes or so. At this point I have stopped any smoking forever. Eventually I went to see a pulmonologist. My PFT was very good. I had an X-ray, later a CT as well and all allegedly looked good. I even had a bronchoscopy about a year after my first problems and all I was told is that my bronchis looked very irritated. I was tested for all kinds of disease like Valley fever but nothing. The diagnosis I got at some point was Reactive Airway Disease. After this first bout, it eventually subsided after almost a year. I felt great for about year and a half. I thought I was cured, but then in December 2019 I caught a cold again and developed the same symptoms all over again - chest pain and coughing up mucus constantly. I started to see a new pulmonologist, but really didn't like her take, she was quite dismissive of my issues and was claiming it is just allergies. My issues subsided after a few months and I felt a lot better, however, in September 2020 it started again, this time without a trigger of a cold or a acute respiratory disease. It is a bit different in that I have a lot less mucus and I don't really cough at all, just a constant chest tightness and chest congestion, scratchy chest and throat and some mucus in my throat as well. Wheezing and rattling at night. What's worse is that for last few months I have felt quite fatigued every day and have had almost constant headaches. Kind of like a low-key flu or cold feeling for months in addition to the chest problems. As far as prescriptions - I tried a lot of different inhalers - Flovent HFA, Symbicort, even Albuterol nebulizer - I feel like nothing was helping at all. Maybe the steroid inhalers were actually making me feel worse. Also I was prescribed Flonase and Montelukast. I don't really get short of breath at all, I can exercise and run just fine. It actually feels very good going for a hike in clean air, however it is very very hot in the summer where I live so there has not been much of that lately. I do not believe I have/had Covid at any point - I'm fully vaccinated since April and I have been isolating really well since March 2020 (I work from home and have been just around immediate family).

I kind of lost hope to get help from the doctors. I don't even have a real diagnosis after all these years. It feels like I have some kind of chronic bronchitis or COPD, but I still hope it is perhaps something less bad and potentially curable or manageable. Maybe adult onset asthma? The only diagnosis I ever got was Reactive Airway Disease which as I understand is kind of non-diagnosis. I'm really scared this will progress further and I'll start having some real breathing issues on top of present problems. I feel like crap every day and the fatigue/headache has been a real problem doing my day job as well lately. I would be very thankful if someone could give me some insight if they experienced similar symptoms or are familiar with cases like this or have any idea what this could be. Or how to find some real medical help (I live in Phoenix, Arizona area BTW). I'm kind of losing hope that I'll ever feel better again.

Thank you very much in advance for your replies!"
"so I was recently diagnosed with asthma a few days ago and currently taking asmanex everyday, I have noticed my sleep has been very bad, can‚Äôt seem to stay asleep for more than a couple of hours a night is this part of asthma or what ?"
Does anyone just get so tired in the heat- get loss of breath or really wheezy? I take my daily and emergency inhaler as needed but I feel like I don‚Äôt know anyone else who is effected by the temperature?? Is this in my head?
"Hi y‚Äôall. I had bad asthma as a child and used an inhaler and a nebulizer. I ‚Äúgrew out of it‚Äù (I.e. no longer needed those things) but still had it in the background, primarily after exercising. Cut to now, I‚Äôm 27F and have been wheezing a lit breathing and realized my asthma is bothersome again. Just left a workout because I was panicking because I couldn‚Äôt breathe and was wheezing and I could feel myself getting out of control. Does anyone have any tips on how to mitigate panic when you have the beginning symptoms of your asthma kicking in?"
"I‚Äôve been off the Symbicort for about five days now. 

The headaches stopped. I did go through a weird emotional roller coaster I didn‚Äôt expect. Now I‚Äôm trying to walk without getting winded. This is next to impossible. I don‚Äôt have a peak flow monitor anymore but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs around 380 or less. 

I‚Äôm not in distress I just can‚Äôt be active if that makes sense. 

I called the doctors office again and I‚Äôm still waiting for the insurance to approve the Breo Ellipta. If they don‚Äôt I‚Äôll ask for Trelegy. 

I hate not being able to take my five mile walk to the beach and back through the woods. It keeps me in shape and light hearted. üòä

Wish me luck I could use it this week. Thanks"
"I‚Äôve had asthma since I was 8 I‚Äôm now 21F. It was moderate/typical symptoms from there on out. I went through a phase when I was 17 where I had severe attacks consistently for a couple months but it was parallel to when I figured out that I was extremely iron deficient. Since then I‚Äôve been better my iron levels are up and have only had two attacks in the last four years. I haven‚Äôt made any life style changes, I was actually way more active back then. I‚Äôm not sure if this sort of thing just disappears over time ..?"
"Hi all, I am currently recovering from a hospital stay last week due to a severe asthma attack. I‚Äôm no stranger to them but this was arguably one of the worst ones I have experienced. Since I‚Äôve come home I‚Äôve been exhausted (to be expected) but I‚Äôve felt so emotional and borderline depressed. The thought of replying to messages feels overwhelming and going back to work fills me with dread, despite the fact I love my job. I‚Äôm on no new meds just a long course of Prednisone, Montelukast and my inhalers (nothing new) but I‚Äôve never felt this emotional upon being discharged before. I wondered if anyone else has experienced this?"

"So this may be asthma tangent because it's technically more allergy related, but I've had allergy induced asthma all my life and its been bad. 

So as a a brief intro if you didn't see the thread- dude keeps 4 beehives in his yard, has done so for 6 years. Neighbors moved in and didnt notice, and have a son who's allergic to bee stings. They expect him to get rid of the bees. And the thread, in my experience, is overwhelmed with people calling him an asshole.

I guarantee that not a single person who's talking about 'imagine if the kid dies because of you!' would be singing the same song if the post was altered a bit and it was someone as highly allergic as I am being forced to share public space with someone who has a dog. In fact, I have a handful of heavily down voted comments saying things like 'You can't put bees on a leash like a dog' and 'nobody is THAT allergic to dogs', when I myself had an ambulance ride a couple years ago because my sister had been out shopping with a friend who has a dog (no contact herself!) a few hours before we were both at our moms house. She was in the house with me for FIVE MINUTES, and in that time I had locked up and realized my inhaler wasn't clearing it out. Do I fault my sister? Her friend? Not at all. I'm in charge of making sure I'm not around any allergen triggers, not my family. And in the scenario of that post, the family that moved in dropped the ball HARD and moved in next door to thousands of their kids death triggers. That is not his fault and he should not be punished or held liable. Its absolutely disgusting how many people give a shit about popular allergies but don't hold the same energy for those of us allergic to shit that isn't as common."
I don‚Äôt want to ruin my lungs with secondhandsmoke and get more health problems with my lungs. I‚Äôm guessing you guys just bought homes in good neighborhoods and high income areas which tend to not have smokers?
"I'm just writing this post to see if I can help anyone else out there suffering. For the last 3 years I had chronic asthma symptoms so bad from chest to nostrils and no steroids, inhalers could reduce symptoms. It become so bad i wasn't able to sleep or hardly smell because the inflammation was so bad. I did peak flow tests and told my lungs were good, and it must be allergies. Test after test and getting passed from GPs to hospitals they couldn't work it out. So I started doing my own research and treatment. One day I took fish oils containing evening primrose oil, grapefruit seed extract, and probiotics and got the biggest reaction that I was almost bedbound. I now know this was due to bacteria dying off in the stomach and gut area and called a herxermier reaction. Doctors still didn't believe me. Eventually I convinced one doctor to take me seriously and I came across a bacteria called Helicobacter Pylori, which the person that found it won a Nobel prize, causes a variety of symptoms. I am now treating it and my asthma symptoms have almost diminished. I wonder how many others out there that have this but have just been told its adult onset asthma or anxiety like they tried to tell me. I acknowledge there is a lot of other types of asthmas reacting to environments etc. that are unrelated to this. However if anyone seems to have anything similar might be worth a shot. I have to say the asthma was so bad started affecting my mental health and day to day life."

"Is this my asthma? I'm a little concerned, I have nothing left to vomit. I'm just left with my anterior chest feeling like it's on fire, my breathing is fine and no coughing anymore. Just an occasional dry heave.

The initial coughs were deep, and then it just was dry heaving and vomiting. Doctors said my asthma (diagnosed May 2021) is bronchial, I'm on singulair 10mg, advair 2 puff twice daily, and a bunch of antihistamines.

I'm also possible mast cell disorder or some syndrome potentially caused by my newly diagnosed endometriosis (they think its severe and causing systemic inflammation).

I have a referral to an asthma clinic, no appointment set yet."

"My doctor diagnosed me as asthmatic a couple of months ago now and told to take the brown steroid inhaler once on a morning and once on a night since may now. The past couple days I‚Äôve had a small cough and my chest has felt abit tighter than usual. Could this be my asthma starting up ? With covid going around I seen asthma and COVID both have the same symptoms but I‚Äôm not entirely sure on what all asthma symptoms are. Is coughing a symptom of asthma?
Thanks"
"Hi There. I‚Äôm 35 F. I was diagnosed with asthma and allergies as a child, primarily exercise induced. My biggest symptom was coughing. When I was a young kid I would do nebulizers multiple times a day and also use a albuteral before physical activities. I also had sinus surgery at age six to enlarge the opening of my sinuses and enable them to drain better. This improved my life but I still have chronic sinus issues and year round allergies. I take zyrtec every day and have taken allergy medication daily since childhood. 

As I got older I ‚Äúgrew out of‚Äù the worst of it, but I continued to struggle with bad coughing any time I would get sick, and find exercise very hard to tolerate.  Today I have several albuteral inhalers around but don‚Äôt typically use them, even before exercise, because I forget to do it and I have a fairly sedentary lifestyle.  But at the height of COVID I realized that my asthma probably is affecting my life more than I realized when I found myself breathless at the top of one flight of stairs. I‚Äôve never had what I would identify as a conventional ‚Äúasthma attack‚Äù but I realized that I think my asthma does limit my daily activities somewhat and resolved to finally see a doctor about this and also my allergies and sinuses.

So I went to the doctor just over a month ago. I got signed up for allergy testing and am going to be starting immunotherapy next week for that. At first he didn‚Äôt seem concerned about my asthma but once I gave him more history he said he wanted to go ahead and test my lung function to make sure that they were in decent enough shape to handle allergy testing, since asthma often has an allergic trigger.  My lunch function came back close to 80% with the test they had me do in his office - I think some form of spirometry. He came in the room and said this is definitely asthma and although it isn‚Äôt super severe it isn‚Äôt normal either. 

He gave me enough samples of breo ellipta to try for the month and said we would re test at my follow up appointment. Well we didn‚Äôt re-test. He did ask me if I thought the inhaler had helped and I said it seemed like it because I was able to climb a different flight of stairs chasing after my kid and didn‚Äôt feel nearly so breathless a few weeks into taking the meds. So he prescribed breo ellipta to me. I discovered I can‚Äôt afford that medication when I went to get it, though, and so I didn‚Äôt fill it. 

I was planning to call him back to ask about switching to something with a generic, but before I could do that I got a message from the pharmacy that I had a new prescription for the Airduo Digihaler. Breo Ellipta is now showing as ‚Äúdiscontinued‚Äù.  That was much more affordable so I did fill that one and have been taking it for like three days.

But the more I read about these medications the more I am not at all sure that this is appropriate for me. They seem to be helping my daily lung function but these combined steroids also seem to be recommended only for more severe cases? Do I need to see a specialist or something or should I just go with it for a while and see how I feel?"
Just wondering why it's considered a bad thing.
"Hi, I wondered how people with asthma are dealing with working in an office these days.

I am 53 and have been working from home since March of last year.  Our unit was told we are going back 25% of the time next month.

I am concerned about going back as I have a chronic cough, especially in the early morning, and have been hassled about it before.  I get that it is annoying to others.  Aside from taking my medication and consulting my doctor if it is getting worse, I don‚Äôt have control over it.  I have allergies and work in an old building and my symptoms are worse at the office than at home.

I am fully vaccinated but I am concerned others might give me a hard time.

My boss is meeting with us individually this week to discuss our telework schedule.  I am willing to go back but if my presence is going to be a problem, I would like to ask if I can work from home as an ADA accommodation.

What are your experiences with asthma in the workplace?  I still have 14 years to go until I retire and don‚Äôt want to change jobs at this point as I have great benefits and am single.

Thank you."
"Can anyone explain why I keep having this feeling of breathing in cold air while also having a constant feeling of it being really cold inside my chest, icy almost? Asthma has not been very well controlled and I started a new maintenance inhaler four days ago, but this is really starting to bother me. Will it go away once new inhaler really kicks in? Thanks for any help."
"Hey guys. I've had asthma since I was a kid. I used to be constantly struggling to breathe growing up until about college. Then I started smoking once the asthma went away (weed mainly) and it came back full force. I have since quit (about two years smoke free).

For the first time in a while, I find it mostly controlled. My peak flows stay around 350-400, even when experiencing symptoms (slight chest tightness or a slight wheeze). It drops below that maybe once every month or two.

The issue is that I cannot handle the slightest symptoms. Minor wheezing (that does not impact my ability to breathe well) and minor chest tightness (that doesn't cause a dip in peak flow) bother me so much. Generally speaking, I'm sure I would be fine to just ride it out until my next maintenance dosage most of the time, but I enjoy feeling my lungs completely clear. I cannot concentrate or do anything with any symptoms present. This has led to me using my rescue inhaler once or twice daily to clear minor issues.

I am trying to lose weight and get my GERD under control to see if that will stop the minor issues each day, but otherwise, what can I do instead of using my rescue medication? I know that it is not good to use it daily. There are many days where I don't use it at all, but there are some weeks where I have to take one puff every day for some reason (usually after walking up stairs).

What are some ways I can relieve symptoms? I will likely discuss it with my doctor at my yearly (in a month) and see what he thinks. But I'd like ideas for now."
"I‚Äôve had asthma for about seven years now and it‚Äôs pretty manageable. I‚Äôll have periods of time when I really need my rescue inhaler and then stretches of time when I don‚Äôt need to use it. 

Lately, in the last couple of months, I‚Äôve had new symptoms. I‚Äôll eat a meal and about twenty minutes later I‚Äôll fall into this coughing fit that gets so bad that I end up vomiting. Most of what I vomit is mucus. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a certain food. I am suspecting that rice is somehow a culprit maybe? 

Afterwards I‚Äôll drink some hot tea and feel better. But it‚Äôs been happening more and more often that I‚Äôm a bit concerned. 

I also haven‚Äôt had COVID. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm uninsured at the moment and don‚Äôt feel like paying an arm and a leg at the doctor."

"I tried smoking a cart yesterday and my asthma seems to be acting up a little, like I  can‚Äôt really get a deep breath in. Any advice?"
"Had a flair up today, went to Wolfson and had got the same nebulizer treatment I‚Äôve been getting since an infant when I go to the ER. Felt the usual Jitters and my watch showed my heart rate at 111-100. They also gave me the liquid steroids and a nice slushy to wash it down. About 3 hours later and I can still feel my pulse through my chest. Is this normal? How do I lower it? I‚Äôve been laying in bed and no change."
"When I was a kid I had what I'd consider mild to moderate asthma and used a maintenance inhaler (I think it was Advair) in addition to a rescue inhaler. I outgrew the need for an inhaler and my asthma only bothered me if I was around smoke or other heavy air pollution. Fast forward to now and I'm 29 and I've had a cough since March. At first it wasn't too bad, I just thought it was seasonal allergies, but it has persisted and gotten worse. Especially after showers I would end up on the floor gasping for breath or throwing¬†up. My doctor tried a couple of allergy meds but nothing helped. I also got tested for Covid and that was negative (plus I'm fully vaccinated). So about a month ago it struck me that I have asthma. He seemed a little skeptical that after all these years I'd be having an asthma flare up but conceded to let me try an Albuterol inhaler 4 times a day for a weekend. It definitely helped significantly. No more collapsing or throwing up. When I reported back he agreed to give me Flovent as a maintenance inhaler. That's not going so well. I'm not collapsing but I'm still having these big gasping coughs where it feels like I'm taking my last breath before I cough. The Albuterol 4 times a day definitely helped more than Flovent twice a day. Anyway, I guess I'm just wondering if any of this sounds normal or about right for asthma and if I should push for him to try a different inhaler or go to a pulmonologist or what? I greatly appreciate any help this sub can offer."
"Can't breathe stomach and gutts feel like fool of air.
Once in a while I have to take a very deep breath or yawn to take in some air while yawning I feel like my airways open up and I can feel comfortable taking in a breath.
I don't think I have a lack of air while doing everyday things but I do feel uncomfortable and feel as I am drowning until I yawn or take a breath"
I don‚Äôt see my pulmonologist until the end of August.  Are your specialists advising you to still mask after being vaccinated?  Thanks y‚Äôall!
I am new to the asthma scene (38 yr old). I am resistant to be on ADVAIR daily (prob because Im scared of ICS). Has anyone been able to get off their ICS once starting it? Or it this forever thing?

"A week or so ago, I had an appointment about asthma management. After a breathing test, I got good results.


Before the appointment, I looked into the side effects of montelukast and found out that in some cases it causes depression. I felt that I had experiences a very low mood pretty often. I asked my doctor about the side effects, and she said that it can cause mood swings. This applied more to what I was feeling than depression did.


Because of my good results, she let me stop taking montelukast. I am so much happier. I used to be very reactive and bad moods seemed to outweigh good ones by a lot, but this has changed. I feel ten times more calm overall. My breathing stayed fine after this shift."
"It should be ventolin.

Personally, along with pro air (actually even more so than pro air), I find Proventil HFA and generic albuterol sulfate to be EXTREMELY shitty."
"Nonasthmatic here, but I could use advice if you have any. I live in the PNW and it is wildfire season. Never been a huge issue for me, but this summer I‚Äôm living somewhere without AC and I do not know what to do about the issues I‚Äôm having with breathing. It‚Äôs hot as hell up here rn with record-breaking heat waves AND fires/smokiness, windows have to be left open at night. Are there semi-inexpensive air filters that y‚Äôall recommend? Is getting a temporary inhaler a thing? 

I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm scared, my head hurts my chest is so tight and I‚Äôve gotten a bit too dizzy when standing up, almost to the point of blacking out. (The anxiety now from realizing what the problem is is also def exacerbating it). Any advice would be appreciated"
"Hello! I've been a lurker in this group for quite a while since my oldest son (9) was diagnosed with asthma a couple of years ago. There's no history of asthma in my family so all this has been totally new for us. We recently changed pulmonologist since our healthcare provider is offering a special program for kids with chronic conditions. We had the first appointment today with the new pulmonologist and he changed his inhaler and prescribed Montelukast. I have read from people with different side effects in this group and I'm worried as I feel is difficult to track all these possible side effects and know if/when I should have him stop taking it. I have basically two questions, do you have any ideas on how to track his symptoms? Anyone who took this s a child and now doesn't need it anymore? (This second question comes from the fact that I don't consider his asthma severe at all and I'm afraid I'll make him dependent of this drug). Thank you!"
"After a reaction last week and another today, I think I have suddenly developed this. Fortunately I already have an appointment scheduled with my immunologist next week, so I will be addressing it with her then, but would love to hear from people who have experience dealing with this. 

Did yours start all of a sudden? 

What kind of reaction do you have? 

How long does the reaction last?

Anything you can do to help feel better once you are reacting? 

I really appreciate it!"

"I‚Äôve noticed the last year or so when I start trying to take the brown inhaler (clenil modulite?) I experience heart palpitations when lying down and it seems to coincide with brief periods of trying to take the medication which leads me to stop. I also have anxiety which I know for a fact is a massive influence on how extreme my palpitations get. I‚Äôve had blood work and ecg done multiple times and all is good, just wondering what to feel/do from here?"
"Does anyone else have a raspy and cruddy voice while taking their maintenance inhalers? It almost feels like my vocal cords are tighter too. I take Trelegy right now but have the same experience with Symbicort. 

I didn't put two and two together until a few months ago when I ran out of Symbicort and my voice went back to normal. Decided to try something different and the doc recommended Trelegy. 

I do gargle and rinse after each time."
"Aside from it being more difficult to breathe, is there any danger to exercising in high heat conditions (100 degree heat index)?"
"I posted here a couple weeks ago when my asthma started going out of control. Since then, I've spoken with a specialist, started a new inhaler he prescribed me with an areochamber, and I have a physical appointment within the week to do further testing with him.

But I've been so anxious and upset for days, and I'd like to hear from people who have already walked in these shoes: if it turns out that I get diagnosed with moderate persistent asthma, or even some type of severe asthma...will I ever get my normal life back?

I've spent the last three weeks hiding in doors, sitting in the air conditioning, barely exerting myself, surrounded by inhalers and lozenges and hot tea and tissues. If I get into the right meds for me, will my life go back to normal? Will I be able to hike again, swim again, work out again? Will I go back to feeling fine, instead of actively feeling 'off' or sick every minute of the day?

I'm scared üòû"
"its about 91-94% average and it doesnt get to 100% no matter how i fast breathe. Thats enough to have servere brain fog.

i have asthma since i was kid and i didnt noticed that my lungs are weak now, maybe?

Should I worry?"

"Hey guys, I've been taking montelukast for about 8 months with little to no problems. My doctor said that because my asthma is under control I could stop taking it. I didnt take it one day and I started to feel asthma-y. I usually take it at night but I took some yesterday morning and since then I've been having heart arrythmia. It will happen once every 30 minutes or so. Is this normal? Hope y'all are doing well."

"How do you all deal with asthma attacks. I get very panicky and everything feels so insignificant. It seems like I am going to die everytime and I cry which makes it worse. 
How do you all keep your calm?"

Recently got a peak flow meter and my average is around 350. What‚Äôs yours?
What do you guys think?
"Some context: I live in an extreme humidity area and have both moderate/severe asthma as well as Vocal Chord Dysfunction, two things that can sometimes go hand in hand. What are ways you all exercise that doesn‚Äôt cause any flare ups? Do corticosteroids help? I‚Äôve resisted due to the bone issues they can cause."
"I‚Äôm assuming my asthma is badly managed as I have chest tightness, coughing and tiredness every single day. I have to take my rescue inhaler 4+ times a day. Has anyone had covid on this sub? I‚Äôm terrified of catching it with the state of my lungs. Thanks in advance!"
"I found out from my respiratory therapist today I likely have asthma and that is why I have been using my rescue puffer more recently (very humid and rainy) and its suppost to be very humid and rainny for a week.

Just wondering what other people with asthma do when its so humid outside... I just got a dehumidifier but it is only powerful enough to do my bedroom... should I look into a very strong unit that will do the entire 1 floor of the house?"

So I finally got one of those off Amazon. And I am wondering how do I know my numbers are good or bad for me? This thing didn‚Äôt come with a chart on how to read them just how to use it. I‚Äôm so new to all that and just want to understand it. Thanks in advance!!
"I've been sick for 4 days, and I got positive covid results today. My question is, how have you coped with asthma and covid? Any weird, non-cdc described effects? I know the cdc listed symptoms like the back of my hand, but my chest is burning right now, has been all day, but I'm not really coughing? I get REALLY out of breath if I just get off/on the couch, or walk up the stairs. My asthma is well controlled normally."
"I was thinking about the meds I got in the 60‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Quadrinal‚Ä¶ Theophylline and Ephedrine in a pink liquid (yuck). Talk about jacking up your heart rate. Amusingly enough it actually offset my ADHD (mostly). Then later straight theophylline pills.

I went through my youth either wheezing or jazzed up."
"Hi, I hope this isn‚Äôt breaking any rules (I haven‚Äôt found rules other than the ones that appear when I make a post)

Here‚Äôs some background for my questions:

I‚Äôm 21 years old and I‚Äôve had asthma since birth. I also used to be really sickly as a kid, like caught the flu every year, got colds and fevers easily, etc. 

My attacks are mostly triggered by season changes, humidity(?) and hot weather (makes me feel like i‚Äôm suffocating), and I‚Äôve also heard that I cough pretty bad in my sleep at times.

Anyways, at some point between 5th grade and 8th grade, my mom stopped ‚Äúbelieving‚Äù that I have asthma (she‚Äôs still in denial to this day but it comes and goes). Every time I said I can‚Äôt breathe/used my inhaler in front of her she‚Äôd get mad and tell me that I don‚Äôt have anything. My sister joined in on it too as an opportunity to insult me and call me a faker.

This (is probably what) subconsciously led me to not use my inhaler like, ever, out of shame and feeling like I‚Äôm fishing for attention, or that everyone is looking at me and judging me ‚Äî until I was around 20 years old. 

So my questions are these:
1. I‚Äôve been using Symbicort for immediate relief recently, but I‚Äôve noticed that whenever I use it, immediately (like a minute later) my heart starts racing and palpitating. It really incapacitates me in my daily life, so I can‚Äôt really go on like this. 

My question is has anyone else experienced this? Is this something that happens? If so, did you switch to another inhaler/did you find out why it happens?

I take Attent 20mg (it says mixed amphetamine salts) for ADHD each morning if it helps

2. Could the years that I‚Äôve barely used my inhaler despite still having asthma worsened it? Or prevent my lungs from maturing well? I‚Äôve recently heard that when left untreated asthma can lead to COPD and it really scared me üòìüòû 

3. What does an ‚Äúuncontrolled asthma‚Äù diagnosis mean? How can you tell if it‚Äôs uncontrolled? And what does uncontrolled mean in that context?

I know this isn‚Äôt an ask a doctor subreddit, but I really appreciate any answers possible. I don‚Äôt really know other people with asthma and as I‚Äôve said I don‚Äôt really have anybody at home to turn to about this, and my appointment with a pulmonologist is still months away :("
"Hey everyone, over the last months I have been trying to identify the reasons for my asthma attacks. I tried to keep a list on what the weather is and how my asthma is on that day, but there is definitely more than just the weather that triggers my attacks. Do you guys have any experience with trying to identify your own triggers? Can you share what works for you and how you found out? I really feel like its time to not just watch helplessly but to try and regain some control."
"Is it just having heavy breathing / a hard time breathing, or is it not being able to breath at all?"
"I‚Äôve spent the better part of six months trying to fix leg cramps, joint pain, and I never felt fully satisfied with this medication. I have to use my rescue inhaler a lot more. It‚Äôs like inhaling some crazy chemicals that just make me sick. 

So I‚Äôll use my nebulizer and fight with the insurance to get a different long term inhaler and if there is none then so be it. I‚Äôve lived with asthma my whole life and managed before long term inhalers were around. 

The side effects are too much. My tongue is swollen again which means I‚Äôm on the verge of thrush. I just had it last month. I‚Äôm over it. Oh and I live the anti inflammatory low fodmaps diet to keep good microbioms on board to keep thrush down. 

I‚Äôm just over it. 

Thanks for listening. üòíüòä

Thanks just ranting more then anything."
"Hey everyone! Sorry for the long post, there‚Äôs a TL;DR at the end. 

I‚Äôm 24 F and for the past year I‚Äôve been having this weird breathing thing. It‚Äôs similar to what some people have posted about but I wanted to detail exactly what‚Äôs going on &amp; hopefully get some advice. 

Starting around last July I started having trouble drawing a full breath. It isn‚Äôt necessarily hard or painful to breathe but it feels like I can‚Äôt reach the bottom of my lungs. Every few breaths will feel normal but the majority will be ‚Äústuck‚Äù. It‚Äôs like I have to yawn but can‚Äôt. It eventually passes but it can last hours to days. 

I‚Äôve never had seasonal allergies before so I‚Äôm not sure but it could be related to that. It started last summer and I also had pretty bad post-nasal drip at the time. I had never experienced that either but it hasn‚Äôt been an issue since. 

The breathing issue got better but still happened occasionally until maybe a month or so ago when it started to become more noticeable again. I guess pollen is pretty bad where I live, we‚Äôre in a bad drought and it gets super dusty and windy. I have dry, itchy eyes sometimes but the breathing thing happens more often than other allergy-like symptoms. 

It seems to happen *regularly* but also *randomly.* Today it hit hard on my way home from an appointment, and I‚Äôve been breathless and kinda lightheaded ever since. I spend a lot of time outside and it doesn‚Äôt ALWAYS happen.  I‚Äôm currently taking notes on when it does happen to see if it‚Äôs a pattern before I go to a doctor but I don‚Äôt have much yet. However, I have noticed that just in general I feel out of breath and tired over the last few days.

It‚Äôs not *painful* to breath but sometimes my heart/chest does feel kinda ‚Äúheavy‚Äù and tight especially when I hit that point the air in my lungs stops and catches. I‚Äôve had heart palpitations, gotten lightheaded easily, and have been terrible at running my whole life but just kinda assumed it was my own fault. 

I can road bike and do yoga just fine, I do a lot of hiking and tend to struggle with uphill but nothing crazy. However I can‚Äôt really hold a conversation while doing even just a light jog. So I do get out of breath way quicker and more intensely than a lot of people despite regular exercise.

**TL;DR: I regularly feel like I can‚Äôt take in a full breath for hours or days, but I don‚Äôt know what exactly it‚Äôs tied to. It‚Äôs been happening on and off for a year and I *think* it happens more in the summer months. Never had allergies before but pollen is suuuper bad where I live. I get out of breath and lightheaded pretty easily and always have.**

What do you guys think? I guess I‚Äôm wondering what else it could be. I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs cancer or a heart thing, obviously.

Any advice for how to approach this with a doctor and what to do until I can get an appointment is appreciated!!"

That feeling when Forest fire smoke is rolling into town and your inhaler is pretty much empty and you can‚Äôt see your doctor until next week
"I went off Montelukast 2 days ago because I think it was making me depressed and my asthma has been worse. 

I took my albuterol before exercising but my chest still felt tight so I took 2 more later and feel much better. 

However I‚Äôm wondering what to do now. Will my asthma get bad again after my albuterol wears off? I don‚Äôt have a doctor right now but will be getting one in a few weeks. 

I‚Äôm on 220 Flovent and I take it twice a day. Should I start taking double at a time? Should I go back on monkelukast until I sort it out? I don‚Äôt know for sure it was the cause of my depression."
"How common is it for breathlessness to be the only symptom of asthma? I get out of breath with minimal exertion, and even when I am at rest, I don't think I am breathing as easily as I should. But I do not wheeze, cough or have tightness in my chest. My doctor believes I have asthma, but I have been using an accuhaler for the last month now and it hasn't helped. So I am starting to query whether I really have asthma, especially due to my lack of symptoms."
"Got out of the hospital for the second time on Saturday. I still need duoneb every 4 hours, I‚Äôm on 50 mg of prednisone a day, and I‚Äôm exhausted from sitting in a car while my husband drives for 45 minutes. I‚Äôm waking up at 60% of my best peak flow if I sleep 6 hours instead of waking up for a neb.

I see my doctor Friday. I‚Äôm supposed to go back to work full time walking 3-5 miles per day Monday. I‚Äôll be better by then, right? This is the longest and worst flare I‚Äôve ever had - BiPap, ICU consult, FOUR HOURS of continuous nebs, it has not been pretty, and I‚Äôm too sick to be home and not sick enough to be in the hospital."
"I haven't found a solid answer to this, but I feel like when I take corticosteroids (like Flovent), I get sick all the time. 

Is this the case for anyone else? My doctor wants me to try Alvesco but I'm scared of getting frequent colds again."
"Hi guys! Those of you guys who run, how do you do it??? 

I'm feeling fine these days and having almost no asthma symptoms but the other day I started running in the morning after doing some walking in the park, and mannn i felt like my chest was gonna explode from the pressure/pain. 

The next day, I started running very lightly but when I stopped, my chest started hurting again. 

I haven't been a runner like ever (I'm 21F) and so how should I go about it?"
"I've been put on Singulair a little over a month ago and I have to say, literally a day after taking it I was able to breathe more clearly thank I've ever been able to breathe before, I was incredibly impressed. I've used my rescue inhaler only once since taking it and that was during strenuous exercise.   
The problem I'm having here is nightmares. I keep having these incredibly vivid mild nightmares that involved my youngest child falling from a dangerous height of some sort and me struggling to save him. Like to the point I wake up gasping and fall out of bed panicked. Should I consider stopping this or is this a fairly normal consequence? I'm going to switch to taking the pill in the AM to see if it helps at night because the dreams are really vivid and freak me out."
"read a lot of scary stuff about terbutaline, i don't even feel safe using it anymore but google is probably overreacting with the side effects as usual, right?

how bad is terbutaline compared to other asthma medications? thanks!"
"I wrote in this sub a couple weeks ago as I currently am waiting to start on biologic therapy for my Eosinophilic asthma. I am currently going through a flare up which is being mildly controlled by steroids but only just. I‚Äôm kind of in the grey area of needing hospital treatment and managing. My main issue is, as always, coughing fits and shortness of breath. The last 24 hours I‚Äôve noticed stabbing pains in both lungs front and back. In all my years of asthma I don‚Äôt ever remember this being such a overwhelming symptom. Does anyone have experience with this/ways to ease the pain?"
Anyone here used corticosteroid medications and been diagnosed with Cushing's Syndrome or other conditions as a result?
"Does anyone know of a good free app to keep a peak flow diary? I‚Äôm in the UK and have recently been diagnosed so want to track my peak flow. All the apps showing as ‚Äòfree‚Äô on the App Store end up just being a free trial and then asking for payment to keep using them.

Thanks in advance :)"
"I have always had Asthma. My first attack was when I was around 4, but luckily it was controlled for most of my life. Life happens and I stopped caring about my health, including my Asthma. I basically abused my inhaler without seeing a doctor for a long time. A week ago I saw a specialist and after tests he prescribed Advair. I haven't used my inhaler since. It's amazing, even my allergies have cleared up and I can exercise without any symptoms of Asthma. Unless you have Asthma then you won't understand what a relief it is. Which is why I wanted to share my story on this subreddit. If you have to constantly use your inhaler please visit a doctor."
"Lately I‚Äôve been having to take my inhaler and breathing treatments more often than usual. It‚Äôs worse at night, I had to take my breathing treatment 5x (I only do it for about 15 sec because I don‚Äôt like the shakes feeling and it 15sec does the job) I recently had a bad sinus infection about 2 weeks ago that put me in the hospital for a couple hours, but all they did was give me steroids. The prednisone helped but it was only for 6 days. Can you become dependent on prednisone? Anyone else experiencing this? Having to take their inhaler a lot lately? Thanks!"
"I recently was not able to control my asthma, so I tried switching from my current, brand new, face mask spacer to one of my dad's old mouthpiece spacers, and VOILA! The medicine reaches my lungs so much more effectively! I followed the exact technique in the instructions of the face mask spacer, but it literally doesn't work. The way I found out was when I got an asthma attack, I normally take albuterol by mouth, but I did an experiment where I tried albuterol once with the face mask spacer, and once with the mouthpiece spacer. The albuterol worked for 4 hours with the mouthpiece spacer (2 puffs of albuterl) and the albuterol worked like 1 hour with the facemask spacer (that too very weakly ""worked"")."
"Hi. I‚Äôm 25 y.o. I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with asthma for the first time. It‚Äôs so confusing and I‚Äôm anxious. 

I‚Äôve been coughing for 8 damn months since I got COVID. I obviously visited doctors and they suspected the GERD (acid reflux) because my cough is getting much worse right after I eat anything. I got the therapy but it didn‚Äôt help. Doctors said they don‚Äôt know what else can trigger my cough then. Cause this is my only symptom along with feeling a lot of mucus/phlegm in my throat that never ever gets out no matter how hard I tried. It‚Äôs just there deep down all the time.

So I‚Äôve been struggling all these months and today I went to another doctor and he said it‚Äôs probably asthma. I would never suggest it because it doesn‚Äôt fit to those asthma symptoms I googled. I don‚Äôt have shortness of breath, or wheezing, or dizziness, I don‚Äôt get up at night, I don‚Äôt feel like I can‚Äôt breath. I just have a stupid cough, that becomes worse after taking food, plus there‚Äôs mucus, plus the feel of tightness and tension in my chest. 

Anyway, I can‚Äôt believe I have this. What if the doc is wrong? Have you heard COVID triggering asthma in people who never ever had it or any other respiratory problems? This is so random and unexpected :(

What would you recommend to read about asthma? Any tips? What is the good a reliable source of info about it in English? Cause my country‚Äôs healthcare sucks and they have a lot of false information, our organisations don‚Äôt follow international standards or even WHO recommendations. Always creating our own ridiculous stuff with false guidelines.

Btw, the doc prescribed me Symbicort (budesonide + formoterol); Prednisolonum for 9 days god knows why; and Montelukast for 1-3 months‚Ä¶Is it fine? Cause our docs love to improvise with useless medication that are not recommended by anyone in the world, so I gotta check it‚Ä¶

Am I going to take it forever? Will I not be able to live without it? Do I have a disability or something now?:( 
Do these inhalers cause addiction or not?"
"Hello everyone (back again),

I've been conducting an experiment across the last week after scoring no higher than 510 with [this Pinnacle PFM](https://www.numed.co.uk/products/pinnacle-peak-flow-meter). Being a fit 22-year old man with no breathing issues in my entire life, I thought this was odd - so I went and purchased [this Medi brand PFM from Boots](https://medicareplus.co.uk/product/medi-peak-flow-meter/). This one cost me considerably more than the Pinnacle PFM. Across the week, I score between 490 and 510 with the Pinnacle PFM. In contrast, I have scored anywhere from 580 to 620 with the Medi PFM. My technique does not change.

My question to the denizens of this subreddit is this: why in heck is this happening? To be absolutely thorough, I bought a second Pinnacle PFM and tested that to see if I had a faulty PFM. Nope. Same low results. Personally, the Pinnacle PFM seems far cheaper, less robust and less well-designed than the Medi PFM. The Medi one seems better designed, ergonomic and accurate. 

Looking at the two, I can see that the Pinnacle PFM has a detachable mouthpiece that slots on. The distance from the opening to the interior of the PFM would therefore seem to be greater than with the Medi PFM - which has a fixed mouthpiece and is one single unit. 

Any thoughts/opinions would be most welcome. I want to have as much ammunition as possible in case the military medical personnel come back and question my lower PFM results (which I had to submit). Thank you."

"First night attack. I'm thankfull my freind woke me up, he said ""bro, you sound like a panting dog"" and then I got my i hailer and only a bit ago I started breathing right. It was scary..."
"I‚Äôve been really depressed and suicidal lately due to a lot of things. I‚Äôve been alone shielding while I wait for my vaccine, my asthma gets triggered every time I go out in the humidity, I have really bad gerd which is making eating difficult, etc. I‚Äôve been super irritable as well in general. 

Being depressed and irritable isn‚Äôt that different but I‚Äôve been feeling very suicidal lately which is new. However I‚Äôve also never been chronically ill in a pandemic before.

I‚Äôm moving in a few weeks to a drier climate and a place where I‚Äôll have better access to medical care. I‚Äôm not sure if I should go off my montelukast or wait. 

I‚Äôm also on Flovent and Claritin and my asthma is fairly controlled compared to what it used to be. I just take albuterol when I work out to help my endurance. 

Obviously suicide is a big deal but I know I‚Äôll feel better when I move and I‚Äôm not alone anymore. I‚Äôm worried if I go off I‚Äôll have an asthma attack by myself. Or do you think it wouldn‚Äôt cause an attack? I‚Äôve never really had one that bad but I struggled with feeling short of breath when I was unmedicated. Now I‚Äôm blowing over what I should be blowing.

Thoughts?"

"Anyone able to breath completely fine through their nose, but not their mouth? 

I‚Äôve had a constant high pitched whistle when inhaling through my mouth the past 4 months that I can‚Äôt get rid of, as well as shortness of breath and cough to clear mucus. Been doing 1000 tests and meds to figure out what‚Äôs happening, but the nose thing confuses me."

"Would it be a good idea to go for a run during record breaking heat wave? (Red alert for today and for the whole week)

For health context I‚Äôm required to use Symbicort daily, I‚Äôm in fairly okay shape and in my mid 20s."

"So, we \*think\* I have had asthma my entire life.  I just don't have normal symptoms like wheezing and coughing.  Just a long history of being sick \*a lot\*.  So I was only diagnosed a few years ago, and only put on maintenance inhalers about a year ago.  I try to ask questions with my drs, and google as needed, but I feel lost and like I know nothing about my condition or how it works.    


Lately, probably from the humidity and rain kicking crud up, I've been having more issues making it through the day without a rescue inhaler use, but I was \*mostly\* getting along ok, until July 2nd.  I got to work and our fryers were smoking...  My breathing started to suffer, but on top of this, I started to feel weak and kinda, idk, out of it.  I moved to a position in the back, used rescue, I saw after a bit that the smoke seemed to be in order, so I thought I was going to get through and be ok.  


Then some idiot decided they needed to start spraying oven cleaner.   I felt like I was going to faint.  I managed to tell a co that I had to leave right now, and basically just made it to my car and passed out for an hour.  When I was able to wake up enough I headed home, where I passed out for 5 more hours.  My mom sent my stepdad out to pound on the door about 3 hours in, and they were getting ready to call the police for a well check.  


I spent all weekend just using rescue, thinking I'd get better, and I didn't.   It hurt really bad to inhale, and I'd have some coughing fits as well.  Dr's were closed for the 4th so they got me in on Tuesday and started on steroids.  I was told I should be good to return today, but I went to wait for my son's bus and I already need my inhaler, and I'm just back to feeling like I can't inhale and a small cough here or there.  


So far, I'm super used to feeling like I can't inhale, like I'm suffocating.  My major symptoms during rough patches have only really been; I can't breathe, coughing fits, and spasms.  I actually had to explain my spasms to the hospital last time because they thought I was laughing, it was like, my diaphragm or something.   I can't remember anything like this though.  I passed out, fatigue has been pretty normal, but I like, crashed hard, and I've been on steroids since Tuesday and I'm only feeling a tiny bit better.  


I don't know what to do, or what's normal.  I've already been off work 10 days.  I guess any advice would be appreciated.  Is it normal to need a couple weeks or more?  

Last year I did have a really bad time where I was sick for over a month, but they'd thought it was strep, and didn't realize it was an URI until I wasn't getting better, it took a few rounds of steroids and an antibiotic before we got it all figured out.  This time I'm not sick, and I'm straight onto steroids, so Idk if I should compare them.  
I'm not sure if it's time to call the dr again.  Maybe I'm just in denial that I'm \*this\* bad, that an attack can throw me into a rut for weeks on end.  I am slightly better, so I'm showing progress I think, but I'm supposed to be good enough to get back to it, and I'm not.

"My wonderful husband wants to move to Wyoming. To be more exact he wants to move to the middle of no where. We‚Äôve had a rough go for the last ten years. Anyway I‚Äôm really worried because the area he wants to live in is covered in snow 9 months out of the year. 

The air just changed in our house a few degrees and I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I thought I was having a small asthma attack. As soon as we closed all the windows and turned on the dehumidifiers I was able to breathe again. (I love our dehumidifier). 

My biggest concern is moving will take away my freedom and I‚Äôll be stuck inside all the time. My lungs can‚Äôt stand the cold. Anyone have any ideas on how to deal with the cold and asthma?

Hi all‚Ä¶I‚Äôve had cough-variant asthma since childhood and since hitting my twenties it has all but disappeared. I maybe see it every few years when I get a bad cold.

";tldr constant breathlessness is making it impossible to school or work, but my doctors say it‚Äôs not my asthma causing it. What do I do? Does anyone know what else it could be?

Quick context: Back in 2018, I (23F) had a sudden attack out of nowhere and was subsequently diagnosed with asthma following a positive spirometry and methacholine challenge test. Before this attack, my only symptom was a persistent cough. Was given an inhaler and remained stable for two years with nothing but a cough. 

Fast forward to 2021: I feel awful. I‚Äôm constantly breathless and my chest is always tight and I can‚Äôt even eat or shower without getting out of breath. I‚Äôve lost almost 10 pounds in three months because I can‚Äôt get through a meal without the breathlessness kicking in. My inhalers (Symbicort and Spiriva) aren‚Äôt helping. I‚Äôve had to drop out of college because I can‚Äôt get through a day without feeling horribly breathless all the time. 

Despite all this, my tests are actually good. FEV1 is around 85%, chest X-Rays and CTs are clear, oxygen levels are fine. I had one round of Bronchial Thermoplasty done and during the endoscopy they found only minimal inflammation. The only test that‚Äôs coming up abnormal is a super high IgE reading. 

Because my tests have been largely good, one of my doctors has started to insist that my breathlessness is psychological. For context, I have a history of depression and anxiety back in my early teens, but have been in recovery for years now. I even checked with psychiatrist of 10 years for her opinion, and she insists my mental health is fine - I‚Äôm not having anxiety attacks or hyperventilating or anything. But my doctors are refusing to take my psychiatrist‚Äôs testimony into account. One is adamant it‚Äôs all in my head, the other just shrugs and says all she can do is increase my inhaler dose (tried it, didn‚Äôt work).

So what the heck do I do now? Does anyone have any experience with this? Would especially like to hear from someone who has comorbid conditions (COPD etc). What could this be if it‚Äôs not asthma?

Additional info: I‚Äôve never smoked, and never had covid (my country is very safe, and I‚Äôve repeatedly tested negative and have since been vaccinated). 

Thanks in advance!"
"I‚Äôm on Breo 200/25. It costs me $60/month which I can handle but I‚Äôm wondering if there is a once a day inhaler that I could use that would cost less. I have tried Google, no luck and I will ask my plum, but she is not super helpful."
"I have suspected cough variant asthma. I have a dry cough that is mostly pathetic and sounds kinda like when you fake a cough, but I‚Äôve had it for years. Occasionally I go into a coughing fit but I always just blamed it on choking on my own spit or something stupid. When I did vigorous uphill hiking it becomes painful to breath and I cough more forcefully. 

I went to see my GP and she gave me a rescue inhaler just in case and a referral for a pulmonologist, but that appointment isn‚Äôt until October. 

Basically I wanted to know if this sound like cough variant to anyone here, also when do I use the inhaler bedsides hiking. Do I use it with my constant random coughs? They aren‚Äôt forceful or really that annoying. Do I use it when I have a random coughing fit. They don‚Äôt usually last long enough for me to be even grab my inhaler. 

Any tips and ideas are welcome. Thanks"

He sleeps and then coughs and wakes up and let‚Äôs put a few huge coughs with wheezing on the inhale and goes back to sleep peacefully. As a parent I‚Äôm just scared. One doctor says Post Nasal Drip, one says RSCV, one says Asthma with an asthma attack, and the other says asthma from a viral infection‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
"i know that chest pain and tightness is normal with asthma (got diagnosed in my early teens), but in the past few months i‚Äôve felt intense heaviness and tightness in my chest and actually around my heart. i also have anxiety so it‚Äôs very scary because i always jump to the worst conclusions. my mom suggested that the stress of school may have been causing the chest pain, but school is over and the pain/heaviness and discomfort is still so bad every day, even if i‚Äôm in a good mood. can anyone relate to this? if so, is there anything that you did to help it?
i believe i may just need to start taking my 4 times a day inhaler again. maybe that would help a lot, lol. this just feels different than before"
"Currently taking 10mg Singulair but it's never really done much. I know my doctor will just want to put me on more meds and I do not like taking them.

Currently taking -

Vitamin D3
Vitamin B Complex
Pumpkin seed oil
Milk thistle
Apple cider vinegar tablets
Folic acid
Singulair 
Fish oil

Most are just suggested amount"
I cant sleep properly for the past nights because ive been cougving at night. i also cough in the morninh but it is tolerable. i also experience itchy skin. could it be asthma? somethimes antihistamine is not working
"My life for the past 2.5 years:

Me: My cough won't go away

Doctor: Here breath some steroids

Me: *coughing intensifies*

Doctor: MOAR STEROIDS! INCREASE DOSAGE!!

Me: *COUGHING INTENSIFIES*

Doctor: OK, here are some different steroids

Me: *coughing intensifies*

Doctor: Uh...antibiotics?

Me: *did not work*

Doctor: MOAR STEROIDZ NOW CONSUME WITH WATER!!!

Me: *Worked for about a month*

Doctor: Breath this totally different steroid

Me: *coughing intensifies*

Me: Imma stop taking preventers

Me: *Coughing does down*

Me: *coughing intensifies*

Doctors: Have I ever told you about this thing called STEROIDZ??"
"15F here. Apologies for format, I‚Äôm on mobile.

I developed asthma at 10. It runs in my family on both sides I believe. I live in London where there‚Äôs a fair bit of pollution, and my house also has a mold problem. I was diagnosed at 13 due to doctors repeatedly telling me I was fine for 3 and a half years.

I developed epilepsy at 11. It runs in my dad‚Äôs family as well. I was diagnosed at 12 after having seizures left right and centre for months.

I would say that epilepsy is my ‚Äòmain‚Äô (for lack of a better word) problem. Epilepsy can come with co-morbidities, like ADHD and autism. I have epilepsy, asthma and a heart murmur. My cousin has asthma, dyslexia and fortunately he outgrew his epilepsy. 

Are there any other asthmatics here who also have epilepsy? Also, if there are any epileptics who have tonic-clonic seizures, have you woken up in an asthma attack because it‚Äôs like a sheer workout? I definitely have."

"Im having one rn, and I just started."
"I have allergies. Have tried many different ones Claritin, Allegra, Zyrtec, Benadryl and etc. But antihistamine does nothing to help my chest and breathing."

Is this normal? My daughter just started taking budenoside respules 2x daily via nebulizer and i notice it is sometimes foaming when we mix it with albuterol (doctor approved).
"Thinking about getting a humidifier, i have heard it‚Äôs not good for asthma though how right is this? it‚Äôs just i get allot of sore throats, i get them so easy.. and often and sometimes i can get post nasal drip which can be annoying. I just want to try a humidifier and see if it could be the air that‚Äôs causing i when i sleep maybe."
"Hi,   


Recently looking into speaking to multiple doctors in regards to a cough I have everyday of my life for the last 10+ years. Asthma doctors back then told me I need to pursue allergy shots, but the idea of a shot every week for years seemed, and still seems impossible to me.   


Just curious, anyone else with asthma have a cough that's been present everyday for over a decade?"
"Hello guys! I am on formoterol budesonide combination 400/12 dose twice a day for months and wanted to know if this a high dose, if it is should I review it with my doctor? 

I've been recently diagnosed with asthma and generally I feel fine as long as I take my inhaler and singulair daily. Never had an asthma attack and I am in mild category"
I just read that they can reduce the likelihood of thrush. I'm aware of Fostair but are there any other dry powder inhalers I should know about? I want to talk to my Doctor about it. Thanks
"Since I started taking asthma inhalers 10 years ago, I've had a problem with oral thrush. As soon as it goes away it's back because my asthma inhaler - Sirdupla 25/250, is the cause. Even inhalers with less steroid still caused thrush - even the lowest one I was first prescribed. As luck would have it, I tried another that didn't cause thrush - Fostair, but then had a bad reaction  - to it - fast heart and itching (go figure :-( These are the things I've tried:

1) Spacer (clean it every week) - Helps but doesn't eliminate it

2) Washing mouth out after using inhaler - Helps but doesn't eliminate

3) Using Daktarin Oral Gel (helps, but it feels like I'm taking it constantly and comes back very quickly)

4) Brushing my tongue (once the tooth brush has been used for a week, it isn't as effective)

5) Using mouthwash - made it worse.

6) Reducing eating sugary food - helps but doesn't eliminate

7) Making sure I'm really relaxed when taking the medication so it predominantly stays in my lungs - helps but doesn't eliminate

8) Brushing my teeth before hand so my mouth is super clean  - helps but doesn't eliminate

9) Using Ventolin a lot (so not recommended as a solution, but when my asthma was bad and I was constantly taking this, my oral thrush basically disappeared which was amazing!)

10) Using Canesten Oral tablet because it works fast to eliminate thrush - but then it comes back just as quickly, because I have to take my inhaler every day.

I can't take probiotics because I'm dairy allergic. 

These are the solutions I was thinking of:

1) Buying a spacer for every day and only using it twice (morning and afternoon) and then washing it.

2) Changing my tooth products weekly.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any ideas, I'd be really grateful because I don't know what to do :-( Thanks!"

"I just started swimming as a way to get exercise since I can't exercise outside due to allergies and because I heard it's supposed to help with asthma.

I am enjoying it a lot but afterwards my lungs are just tired and hurt a little. So my question to you is does anyone else do this? Is it a good sign that I am coughing up mucus and that my lungs are done for a day or two? Or should I try to swim really slow? Am I hurting myself longterm?

Any other tips?

Thank you!"
I just wanted to do some reseasrch on asthma attacks since I am writing a book and one of my characters is prone to them. So my character is out on vacation and has no inhaler with them. Is it possible for it to just stop by itself?
"In the hospital for the second time in two weeks, the major danger appears to have passed but I‚Äôm crashing hard at the slightest provocation so they want me here until I‚Äôm less brittle and stable on oral steroids (which, they haven‚Äôt even tried, and none of the evidence suggests IV is any better than oral afaik).

My asthma is triggered by viruses and irritants like smoke and perfume. There‚Äôs a great big sign on my door saying no perfumes or cleaning products. Twice in a 12 hour period, I‚Äôve had someone come in, say they saw the sign so they‚Äôll be fast because they‚Äôre wearing perfume, and leave me gasping for air. I can‚Äôt go home until I stop having shit like this happen, and nothing the hospital is doing is preventing this - their solution is for me to wear a procedure mask any time someone is in the room, which doesnMt address the time it takes to dissipate and doesn‚Äôt work spectacularly any way.

I talked to the charge nurse. She says it‚Äôs too hard to monitor everybody and ‚Äúshe‚Äôs aware of the complaint.‚Äù The replacement for this morning‚Äôs fragranced nurse asked me if I work from home, because I have to understand I canmt control people like this out in public - which is why I wonMt be out in public until I‚Äôm less brittle. This time last month, the nurse this morning wouldn‚Äôt have bothered me. Right now I‚Äôm on a hair trigger which is WHY I‚ÄôM IN THE HOSPITAL.

What am I missing? What else can I do? I‚Äôm feeling humiliated and defeated and I am so sick of not breathing."
"My Symbicort was between 0-20 on the counter when it stopped helping me, so I got a new one.

But I decided to investigate and break open the old one, and there's at least a teaspoon of powder still in there! 

I think it was jammed somehow. Does anyone know how to un-jam it in the future? I dont have insurance, so these are expensive and I dont want to waste any of the puffs"
I might be subject to mixing the vaccines. Would love any feedback from people who‚Äôve done this!

"i wondering if here are asthma patients that have had corona and notice positive effects of their asthma puffers.

Its looks like this medication is perfect for fighting corona. There was recently a dutch article written about how remarkably few asthmatics end up in ic with corona. https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5193704/corona-astma-covid-19-risicopatienten-rivm-longartsen

""During the first wave, we have only seen one asthma patient in the ICU in our hospital, and during the second wave also one so far. That's relatively little when you see how common asthma is in the Netherlands,"" says Gert-Jan Braunstahl, a pulmonologist at Franciscus Gasthuis &amp; Vlietland in Rotterdam. He is considered the expert on asthma in the Netherlands.

He treats dozens of patients with (severe) asthma. Some 15 to 20 of his patients became infected with the coronavirus in the past six months. ""Two people had to be hospitalized, but in most of my asthma patients this corona infection had a mild course. They had mild symptoms like colds, headaches and feeling fluish.""

Other pulmonologists this picture as well. among pulmonologists there is a perception that asthmatics are relatively less often hospitalized because of corona,"" says Leon van den Toorn, president of the Dutch Association of Physicians for Pulmonary Diseases and Tuberculosis (NVALT).

And other countries are also drawing the same conclusions. ""Despite warnings that asthmatics would be at higher risk, they are underrepresented in death rates,"" the New York Times wrote in May. An earlier study published in medical journal The Lancet also showed this. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/coronavirus-asthma-risk.html#:~:text=Despite%20warnings%20that%20asthmatics%20were%

https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2213-2600%2820%2930167-3

Puffers may have protective effect ""The inhalers, or puffers that asthmatics use, often contain steroids. These have an anti-inflammatory effect,"" says Braunstahl.

ps, sorry, English is not my first language"
"I have poorly mis managed cough variant asthma, but I know my triggers and work around them. However, once a year I get a simple viral cold and it always sends me into a nightmare of a time with my asthma. 

I got sick on Sunday. By Monday I felt like death, but was still able to sleep it off. Tuesday and Wednesday roll around and I can't go 2 minutes without a severe coughing attack. I'm taking *everything* I can think of to stop this cough.  Tessalon pearls, mucinex,  my rescue inhaler, hydrocodone (cause narcotics can ease coughs, right? Right?), baclofen (grasping at straws here....muscle relaxer...bronchodation...idk man it was a though), humidifier next to my bed, hot showers, Vicksburg vapor rub, tea/water/bubble water, cough drops anything! I am not getting more than an hour or two of sleep at a time. By Wednesday I try to go to urgent care but I get turned away for not having an appointment. 

I manage to get in with my PCP Thursday, cause at this point I'm using my rescue inhaler every 2 hours (shame on me, I know).  My O2 was in the 80s when I was getting roomed, but I had just walked 10 feet like a normal person and hacked up a lung, but by the time my doc had come in it was back to like 98%. I tell her everything, including how I'm coughing so violently I'm vomiting, losing my voice, getting dizzy, having hot and cold flashes (no fever though) and can't say more than 4 words before coughing. I tell her I *know* this is cough variant asthma.

She listens to me reenact someone with TB dying of the plague, listens to my lungs (no wheezing), gets a chest x-ray (no pneumonia) an covid swab (negative). I beg her for steroids, and she refuses due to my mental health issues. I keep begging and she finally gives me an inhaled steroid but absolutely refuses anything else. She throws a Zpack at me because ""they can sometimes reduce inflammation."" 

Now it's 3am, I can't sleep, my head is throbbing, I've puked up 2 dinners and a round of meds, can't lay flat and still sucking on my rescue inhaler like it's my favorite dick. 

I personally think I should go to the ED, but as a very fat, woman with documented mental health issues and a non typical presentation....I'm wondering if it is worth it??

Tl;Dr help. I'm a fat cough variant asthmatic in crisis getting no support from my health care team. What should I do?"
"I've had asthma since I was 4.5 years old. It's been well controlled since I was an adolescent. I'm 22 now and my asthma is all of a sudden awful. It started in March, I was in urgent care one night and the ER the next day. I started seeing a pulmonologist/allergist in May. They ruled out allergies, changed my daily inhaler to Breo, and but me back on Singulair. I saw him again in June and was getting better, but he brought up me potentially having vocal cord dysfunction on top of my asthma. He said we would see how the next three months go and then potentially test me for it.

Then a few weeks ago I noticed that my voice was cracking a lot and was very raspy, along with constantly feeling discomfort in my throat. I messaged my pulmonologist and he said it's probably VCD and started me on Pepcid. 

Now I'm having the issue where I try to go to bed and I'm feeling a little short of breath. I only get a few hours of sleep in before I wake up each night not able to breathe. Luckily each time so far my rescue inhaler and the breathing exercises have helped, but I'm so frustrated. Thr lack of sleep is causing my migraines to get flare up as well and I'm afraid it's going to start affecting my school on top of everything else. It's also just really scary waking up not able to take a full breathe. 

I plan on calling my pulmonologist tomorrow but he's usually booked out 3 months in advance so I don't know if I'll be able to see him before my September appointment."
Has anyone had this test and had a horrible experience? They used it on me yesterday to diagnose me with asthma and I was in the ER 11 hours later unable to breathe. First ever asthma attack. They gave me the nebulizer and I left the hospital with a lower oxygen level then quen I got there and they refused to do anything. It's the next night and I'm still struggling horribly. I can barely breathe but I dont want to go hack because they wont help me. My inhaler doesn't work at ALL. I dont know what to do
"I (26F) have apparently had asthma for years according to tests, but never experienced any symptoms, even during wildfire season. A few months ago I had an attack, and now I use a preventer inhaler 2x daily and it seems like the asthma is relatively well-controlled unless I go near something triggering. But something that I find really upsetting is that I seem to start wheezing when doing exercise that increases my heart rate significantly like rock climbing. I went climbing today after months of not climbing, and I felt really good at first, until I started having a wheeze. I took my reliever inhaler and stopped climbing, it took about half an hour to feel pretty normal again. I did take 2 puffs of my reliever inhaler before climbing as well but the wheezing still happened. I did go biking yesterday without taking a reliever before and I was totally ok, but I was more careful while biking to not get my heart rate too high. My heart was pumping hard while I was climbing, and I didn‚Äôt notice how hard it was pumping until I started wheezing. 

So my question is first of all, is this normal to wheeze even after a reliever prior to exercise if it‚Äôs an exercise you haven‚Äôt done in a while, or should I be concerned about this? 

My second question is for those of you who have improved been able to reduce your exercise-related symptoms by increasing exercise slowly, at what point do you stop exercising if you start having symptoms? Any tips for increasing my fitness level while dealing with this? 

Thanks"
"I‚Äôm on 220 Flovent HFA inhaler I take in the morning and evenings. Cleaning instructions specifically say not to remove the canister and only clean the mouthpiece with a cotton swab. 

Even cleaning regularly about half way through (60/120) it almost always just stops spraying nearly as much and by the end of the inhaler my asthma is bad until I get the new inhaler - then it takes another week to even out - then a week later the inhaler is weak again and the asthma starts getting worse again. Ugh. 

Does anyone have this issue? Or have found anyway to help it?"
"I have an inhaler that I'd like to give someone (**for temporary use**) that's expired on **June 21**. It still has ""**173**"" pumps. Seeing as how we're now in **July 21**, is it safe to give for **temporary** use? Or is it not safe at all and I should throw it away now and buy a brand new one?"
I get cold-induced asthma episodes perhaps for a few days or weeks during the cold months of the year and when I exercise outdoors. The rest of the year I do fine except for some allergies and I also don't exercise much. Do I need to be evaluated by a doctor and perhaps take daily inhalers or meds?

"Hello!

I've been having a not great time lately thanks to other health issues that resulted in me going in and out of the ER for a week. Each time I went the triage nurse seemed shocked I'd never gone to the ER for my asthma, given I've had it for years. 

I never went to the ER for asthma before because I'd just keep using my emergency inhaler until it worked, even if it took hours- because isn't that what an emergency inhaler is? But no, apparently I should've gone to the hospital on those occasions??? I always assumed you only went to the ER if you had an attack and didn't have your inhaler on you.

When are you supposed to go to the ER for your asthma?"
"I am 26, have had asthma my whole life. It‚Äôs currently very well maintained due to medication (singular daily, pulmicort 180mcg once per day). I exercise regularly and haven‚Äôt had to use a rescue inhaler in probably 8-10 months.

I am going to Southern Utah  in August (fully vaccinated). I am worried about the altitude and dry heat. Elevation where I‚Äôm staying is around 3,000- I will also be traveling to a part of Arizona that hits about 4,000. 

Should I be worried about altitude sickness and it impacting with my lungs? Anyone whose been to these areas please let me know, thank you!

Side note: I am traveling from the northeast, summers are super humid where I am now."
"Hello everyone, I had asthma since I was a child and it suddenly stopped when I reached puberty. Stopped using any medication for it as the doctor suggested. I‚Äôm 22 now and I just got into cross fit. Whenever I train hard I get milf difficulty breathing and the doctor said it may be exercise induced asthma and prescribed me Ventolin before training.

I‚Äôve read a lot about it and some studies suggest that it may increase my symptoms if I stopped after regular use. Is this correct? The tightness happens when I over exercise only and my asthma symptoms been gone for too long and I don‚Äôt want them back."
"Would like to know people's experiences with these medications as far as efficacy and side effects.

Also, does anyone know if they've ever been compared head to head in clinical trials? They've been around for awhile so I would assume so, but having difficulty finding comparisons."
"Hello y'all! Long time asthmatic here, I have been on formotherol budesonide (200/6) combo for ages, pretty much since times pre-teen now. Up til last year I have had my asthma under control and was generally active. I was successfully doing couch to 5k, HIIT routines, cycling and weight lifting as well as a lot of walking. I had my moments of asthma flaring up but it was not much in comparison to this year.

Starting this year I went thru covid and that was the second least pleasant thing just after pneumonia. My cardio took a turn for worse but I started getting better during late winter / early spring. However, end of May I started getting really bad asthma attacks. I know it's a particularly bad year for allergies in UK, but I haven't had this many issues for ages. I've got my meds changed to Fostair (200/6) and they have helped a lot, but last night I got a pretty nasty asthma attack (not as bad as the one before I changed to Fostair though)

I was wondering if anyone experienced a similar thing and their asthma got worse after covid infection? Or is that just a particularly bad allergy season?

Cheers x"
"Has anyone gained weight from their inhaler? I‚Äôm working out and getting over 10K steps a day, but I am picking up weight. Any advice? I do work sedentary, but I stay moving and I also use a mini pedal bike under my desk and chase around my threes year old. I‚Äôve added some cardio and full body workout as well. Just not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I used to eat exactly what I am now and not gain‚Ä¶ I drink plenty of water so I have no idea. I only eat a light lunch and sometimes I don‚Äôt, but I will eat supper. Help!?!"
"I'm trying to get accommodation for work, I've been off 7 months and I've been given a 2 week deadline to come back or be terminated.

I've got a lot wrong with my body but the main things that effect work are poor activity tolerance (easily fall into shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, fever, severe pain). But being sedentary I can maintain a certain tolerance with still occasionally shitty symptoms.

I am diagnosed with asthma (among other things) but haven't had a general practioner until now. I am a RN and what I'd like to seek for now at least is a desk position. Getting into the hospital for my labs and diagnostic imaging can lead to me running out of breath, sanitizer can cause coughing/dry heaving. I'd just like to go be tucked away in an office.

I take advair and singulair, as well as antihistamines. I use my PRN ventolin just having to go to the grocery store or going into appointments. I try to do my laundry but I get short of breath bringing it up the stairs. Sometimes I walk around my block and it ends in vomiting. So I'm going to ask for no-minimal lifting and minimal walking (under 15 mins). 

I have a pretty strong union, I just know this is a bit to ask for."
"My son has had asthma all of hi life, so I'm not new to the game. I've always had a tendency to get bad respiratory infections, that would last a month or so.   I got COVID for the entire month of December, but didn't have insurance.  Used a nebulizer daily which I'm sure kept me out of the hospital.  After I got better I was still super tired, and out of breath.  They did an Echo, and a chest X-ray.  Both fine.  PFT was ok, but showed I had an overreactive airway, so Dr said I have Asthma.

He put me on SymbiCort twice a day, and Albuterol as needed.  I haven't really needed it since going on Symbicort.

But  it keeps me up half the night.  True, I am no longer coughing all morning, but still....does the insomnia get better?"
"I‚Äôve been using Bricanyl Tubuhaler for about 19 years, had an accident on my bicycle and was in the hospital and the doctor there asked what asthma medication I was taking. I showed him my Bricanyl and he prescribed me Symbicort lol  Tubuhaler instead saying to use that one. He was in a rush and didn‚Äôt explain why and left. 

They both look almost identical except one base is blue and other is red (and different labels).

Been taking the Symbicort since, but have no clue why I got switched."

"I have asthma, but not the ""normal"" asthma symptoms. I feel lightheaded, out of breath/fast heart rate (usually 120+) during an asthma attack, rarely have wheezing or coughing, pulse ox is normal during attacks. Anyways sometimes during these attacks I feel a very sharp pain when breathing in and it may last just 30 seconds or a few minutes, it feels like it's at the bottom of my lungs. I have moderate asthma where I can't fully breathe out according to the pulmonologist. I should be on asthma meds (Arnuity/Ventolin) but due to metabolic issues I can't safely metabolize a lot of drugs (vertigo, etc waiting to see endocrinologist, may be my thyroid). I am wondering if those sharp leg cramp like pain in my lungs are normal during an attack and if it's  normal to feel faint all the time? Like I feel like I'm a feather and can't really feel my weight at all, feels way worse when doing exercise like oxygen isn't getting to my brain, I see blue (about to pass out) at times during these asthma attacks. Also can you have an asthma attack with symptoms but have a normal 98/99 blood oxygen? Local hospitals kept thinking it was ""anxiety"" when I'd feel faint and see blue/ air felt thin but looking back it was probably my undiagnosed asthma. Last question, is it worthwhile to get a medical bracelet/necklace for asthma? The local hospitals are all idiots thinking everything is ""anxiety"" and I don't want to have my asthma kill me if it ever causes a severe asthma attack with high heart rate/seeing blue/ feeling faint."
"Just took an asthma diagnostic test at the hospital this morning. They gave me medicine to make me short of breath and found that I do have asthma. Doctor gave me lots of inhaler puffs after and told me to drink a coffee because caffeine kills the medicine. Finished a large coffee and used my inhaler a few more times. It is still kicking my butt. Coughing so hard I gag (peed myself a little once I coughed so hard) does anyone have any advice? They gave me no advice and taught me nothing about asthma before sending me home. Can I use the inhaler too much? Can you overdose on an inhaler? Should I keep using it till I stop coughing and wheezing?? He said I was in the safe zone before I left so I'm not gonna go back and don't feel it's bad enough to need to go back just very uncomfortable. 

Any advice? D: pls help?"
"15F here. Apologies for format, I‚Äôm on mobile.
See, I have pretty bad hay fever. It‚Äôs been partially okay recently with my antihistamines, even though they don‚Äôt stop the symptoms completely. 

The pollen count where I live today was very high.

When I was in biology class, we were using microscopes to see the stomata in leaves. For some reason, we had to use nail polish. I then started to have an asthma attack and sat outside with my inhaler for a little while until I felt ready to come back inside.

I was wondering, is it possible that the nail polish triggered an asthma attack, or was it just the pollen?"
"Its only in the front of my lung/chest area 

Its not pain
Its not shortness of breath 
Not a tightening feeling 
Its not congestion 
No coughing
Not acid Reflux 

Its just discomfort, but I cant put a name to the sensation. I hope others can relate

I would try to describe the feeling as... 
I guess inflammation, but idek what inflammation feels like. Its almost like a burning sensation, but its not burning, thats just the only word I could think of."

"Recently, I have showed symptoms of asthma.. But I'm not sure whether it is asthma. I might go to the doctor tomorrow or on Saturday so for now I'm making a post here lmao.

The symptoms I'm experiencing right now:

1. Shortness of breath and often hyperventilating
2. Fast heartbeat
3. Chest tightness
4. Sneezing and a bit of mucus
5. Dry coughing from time to time

The reason why I'm not sure that this could be asthma is because I have carpal tunnel syndrome. I have been diagnosed with it a month ago and it was almost gone. When I started hyperventilating, my carpal tunnel started flaring up really bad. My arms and hands would go numb. My legs also went numb when I have a hard time breathing. Now I'm not saying that this is is heart failure but my calves have also been swollen now for 3 days. I'm not sure if this is supposed to happen if you have asthma. I'm also experiencing pains and needles on my chest so I'm starting to get worried. Has anyone here who have asthma experienced this?"
"Hello everyone,

I am writing here to hear your opinions and experiences on living with asthma.

First, I would like to tell you my history and how I am diagnosed: Around 10 years ago, I needed a chest x-ray for an official document and my doctor told me I should visit pulmonologist after seeing the x-rays because there is a problem on my right lung. I've just ignore his warnings until a month ago and decided to give a visit to a specialist. He asked for another x-ray and after that to be sure the pulmonary function test. After I failed on the test he suggested that I should buy a peak flow meter and record the measuring. So I did what he asked for, at first I was getting 200 L/min until I learn how to blow then my recordings were around 350 L/min. When I showed the table of my recordings, he said they are not good and prescribe me a inhaler (Foster) and said that I should use it and see if there is any change such as before exercise. I use it and didn't notice any change. Either I do not know how is normal breathing or it does't helping me or my asthma is not that severe.

And now I will explain why I am here to ask your help, as a scientist I love to find the bottom of the problem. I live without any problem related to my breathing until now.  Yes maybe I was always puffed after climbing the stairs or after a run but hey I am not an active person and it might be the reason. When I was 9, I got very pneumonia but it was treated well. Side note to that, when I was reading old medical books from 90s to learn more about asthma and lung diseases, I found interesting fact: a small red rash appear under right eye is a sign of pneumonia. I've always had this rash. When I consult to a dermatologist about it, they always said it is because of stress. I do not have any one in my family with an asthma so I have to eliminate genetic factors. My mom was a cleaning addict, which I now in some cases can be the reason of child asthma. Plus one of the student flats I've lived had a mold problem, which is very recent though. Other than the ones I wrote here I can't think any other reason for my asthma. It would be very nice to hear your opinions.

I am an expert on material characterization using variety of equipment and some are same as the ones in hospitals. I decided on my free time to learn how to read medical x-ray scans for fun since I have ""experience"" with them on another level and shouldn't be that hard to figure out but to me all looks same. I added mine so an expert can explain it to me."

"Hi,

I would like to share my story about experience with covid19 and asthma.

 It started out that I was a normal healthy person who had never had asthma and no one in the family had ever had hereditary asthma. Then I got covid in 2020 about May it was symptoms of intestinal flu which lasted 8 days with it also unbearable headaches. After the symptoms disappeared, I started to breathe harder and I experienced asthma attacks. I went to an allergist and I was prescribed Dasselt 5mg and he gave me ventolin, the symptoms improved a bit but it was terrible when I exercised so it happened that I had an asthma attack the same morning or at bedtime.

 I was recently vaccinated with the first dose of pfizer it's been 5 weeks and the asthma symptoms have disappeared, I've discontinued allergy medications and I'm back in normal life as before. Now, I have no chance of getting into an asthma attack. The glory of the vaccine."
"I always get phlegm when I laugh too much, sometimes with coughing too. Does this happen to everyone else or am I just dying?"
"I have had asthma for as long as I can remember and i have to take my albuterol + qvar everyday or else I wil wheeze for the entire day. Today, completely out of the blue, my inhalers just straight up aren‚Äôt working and ive been wheezing and short of breath all day. Help?"
"I was allergy-tested for the COVID Vaccine (Pfizer) a month ago with no immediate reaction and was cleared for the vaccine, but several weeks later noticed that the spot I was tested on created a large dark spot (which I shrugged off as discoloration from the chemicals).

After receiving the first shot of Pfizer, I experienced asthma attacks for about three days straight, starting two days after the first shot.

My allergy doc just informed me that the discolored spot is actually a delayed allergic reaction, and to prepare for the second dose with a litany of prednisone.... and I'm not sure how I feel about that. 

Has anyone else experienced asthma after their first dose? How did it go for the second?"
"Hey all, this ended up a bit longer than I intended.

  
So let me start off by saying I‚Äôm in my late twenties with history of smoking cigarettes (quit 5 years ago), smoking cannabis (quit when I started having symptoms) and a family history of asthma. Last year on October 2nd, I started experiencing incredibly sudden shortness of breath, fast heart rate, sweating, tiredness, brain fog, and a bit of nausea. It happened in the evening as I was washing a few pots and pans by hand. it lasted all into the next day, and from there on out about 2.5 weeks. it was very scary and I had never experienced anything like it. I continued to have these shortness of breath symptoms for weeks at a time (minus the sweating and nausea) with maybe a week break in between where I felt ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I have never had a day like I did on October 2nd, so while I‚Äôm happy about that, I still can‚Äôt breathe like I used to.

Fast forward to this year, I got a diagnosis of asthma even though my breathing tests were fairly ok (I mainly attribute that to having a good breathing day where I could breathe well that day). I don‚Äôt wheeze, I don‚Äôt cough. I just cannot take deep breaths for hours, sometimes days at a time. I also yawn excessively during these episodes. Sleeping will give me temporary relief but a lot of the time my shortness of breath will come back within the hour of waking up. Sometimes it will be the same as it was before I slept, sometimes it will be a bit better. 

i have suspected GERD and am on medication for that. I am also taking Albuterol inhaler. i recently became pregnant and so my pulmonologist switched me from Breo back to Flovent and I am back to being miserable. I used to only have episodes two to three days a month while on Breo but they were never awful. 

Since switching back to Flovent twice a day, Im having more frequent shortness of breath. I feel like Flovent does not work well with me but my pulmonologist said he was taking me off of Breo because there is no research on taking it while pregnant. He did however mention that if the benefits outweigh the risks he would put me back on Breo, but the risks are unknown? I have no idea. I‚Äôm going to message him again asking what the risks are but it makes me nervous going back to a medication he took me off of because in the message he wrote to me he specifically said it was unsafe for pregnancy.

This kind of turned into a bit of a vent, sorry about that. I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone had very sudden symptoms randomly one day with absolute zero warning like I did. Lots of healthcare professionals have tried brushing this off as anxiety since I used to be on anxiety medication because of post-partum anxiety, but I haven‚Äôt felt anxious in a few years and I have a pretty stress free life."

"I am super frustrated. I‚Äôm also seeing a doctor at my primary care practice tomorrow morning, so looking for reassurance more than medical advice.

I made a pie (sat down to make filling and used pre-made crust from when I‚Äôd initially intended to bake before landing in the hospital) and I made a batch of jam (basically, sit at the stove and stir for 10 minutes, get my husband to fill jars and wipe rims). That‚Äôs it.

My peak flow went from 440 to 370 (pb 590, so that‚Äôs a significant drop). I‚Äôm two hours out from my next nebulizer treatment, and I‚Äôm supposed to go back to work where I have to walk 3+ miles a day and deal with often-smoky or fragranced people on Wednesday, and I just don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs happening. Also, I still can‚Äôt talk, and do you know how fun it is to parent a toddler with no voice?

Somebody please remind me this is normal for recovery from a severe flare? I‚Äôve had four days inpatient, one day of BiPap, three doses of IV solumedrol plus one dose of IM plus prednisone, two rounds of magnesium sulfate, three hours of continuous nebulizers (four if you count taking my rescue inhaler twice and getting a nebulizer in the ambulance within the space of an hour), and nebulizers every 4-6 hours for over a week and I‚Äôm still not better yet but also not bad enough to go back in. This SUCKS."


"I have had asthma my whole life but have had a poor education on asthma and how to live with it. My county is having record high temps this summer with awful pollen, and I'm struggling worse than I have in years. 

I have two inhalers, a stronger one I can only use twice a day, and a 'maintenance' one for four hour intervals. I've had to max out my dose.

For the last 5 or 6 hours I've had shortness of breath, a lump in the throat, feeling like I can't get a full breath. Taking my inhalers only helped a bit, maybe 20%. Should I go to the hospital? Or is this normal? Please help"
"Hi everyone, like the title says, i am a college student. My current area of research could be helpful to people with asthma. I have asthma and have already spoken to a few others with asthma. What i have found is that our experiences vary greatly in things such as severity, triggers and the ways we deal with it. I would like to speak with as many people as i can to get a broader picture. If anyone would be willing to help out and give me a brief interview, please dm me or respond to this post. Thanks!"
"I've not dealt with this before, some of my windows were open because of my portable air conditioners. I've since sealed them all, I got more smoke exposed with that. We're in a heat wave and lots of fires are going on.

The smoke that's gotten in has my lungs burning, I take advair in the AM, with singulair, and antihistamines. I am starting to cough a bit, my chest feels tight, the front of my neck hurts too.

I know it's not an asthma attack, the lungs are just irritated. I'm not sure how to manage this, I don't think my house is well insulated enough for the smoke. It feels like more is getting in, I'm a northerner so it's decent enough to hold out the cold but not effective right now.

Any tips for staying out of the smoke? Temporary insulation?"
"What the title says. I am a petty obese 14 year old so I convinced myself it‚Äôs just fat and if I were to lose weight and increase my stamina I would feel better and while I haven‚Äôt yet done that, my symptoms seem to align with asthma. I‚Äôve had a cough for like 2 years now and I assumed it was due to my coka cola addiction which got me fat in the first place but I‚Äôve been free of any soft drinks for 6months and I still have it. It‚Äôs gotten worse recently, I‚Äôve used my dad‚Äôs inhaler for relief but only rarely, now it happens daily. Today, I began wheezing and i could not stop exhaling. I could only breathe in for half a second before being forced to exhale. I tried to relax my breathing, drank honey and coffee. Nothing. Then finally I asked my dad for a puff and felt better. I saw someone describe asthma as breathing through a straw while jogging and that‚Äôs how I feel. I wake up at night to cough and can only get relief with the inhaler. Do I have asthma?"
"I've been struggling with migraines at the moment, and last night I realised that it's been almost a month since I had my daily inhaler. Yep, not a proud moment but that's fine. I didn't have any issues while not on my inhaler (probably because I've been pretty much bed ridden), but I've found that today I'm coughing a lot. There's movement in my chest, but I haven't been able to actually get anything out yet.

Does anyone else find they get a little worse before they get better?"
"I live in Bogota, and the air pollution really affects my asthma, although I am not that affected by its altitude (2,500 mts msl).

What about you?"

Even before I knew I had asthma, I always got so freaking uncomfortable when people talked about lungs, when I saw lungs pics during biology lessons and related stuff. I just don‚Äôt want people to talk about lungs at all, or show me something about lungs. The moment I see lungs I get uncomfortable. Especially when it‚Äôs about diseases. My mom says my asthma could be the reason.

Anyone else ever experienced the same thing?"

"Howdy! Childhood asthmatic, haven't had an attack in 17 years...until today, when I landed in the ER. 

We are looking after a friend's home while they are away, and the trigger is definitely somewhere in the bedroom. I haven't had any trouble elsewhere in the house. I have washed all the sheets, locked the feather duvet and pillows in a closet (and had another asthma attack doing that), but I'm worried that when I go to bed tonight I'll have another attack. How do I go about figuring out what is triggering it (besides burying my face in different things in the bedroom until I start wheezing)?  


(Yes, I am setting up an alternate sleeping spot in case the bedroom doesn't work out.)"
"I‚Äôm looking at needing to go back for more medical attention today after a week of flare that had me inpatient Tuesday-Friday - my sats are okay, but my peak flow is dropping (currently 62% of best, 20 minutes after a duoneb, and this time yesterday it was 76% of best 20 minutes after a duoneb) and not responding to treatments as effectively. The problem is that I cough a lot with asthma attacks and I‚Äôm sitting here like the Little Mermaid with legs - I can barely croak anything out. I can text my husband or use the weird pidgin sign we‚Äôve developed because this loss of voice happens with every bad flare so he can talk for me, but we have an asthmatic three year old that no urgent care/ER wants to have running around underfoot and no good childcare options without driving half an hour. I can write, but that‚Äôs slow and my hands hurt.

1. What‚Äôs my best bet here for communicating with doctors?

2. What can I do to get my voice back faster?

3. What can I do to not lose my voice in the first place?"
"So I smoke, (pls don‚Äôt come at me haha) as you can read I have a pink inhaler (my friends call it fake asthma since it‚Äôs apparently very weak?) but I‚Äôm alright with that.
so I have 2 questions 

1. Is the pink inhaler the weakest one and does it even work?
- I always feel weird when someone asks to see my inhaler and then scoffs when they see the color... like okay

2. Should I use the inhaler after I smoke or try to wait with the inhaler?
-When I smoked yesterday I had difficulty breathing for around an hour and I never bring the inhaler with me because I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a reliever. It honestly was a difficult task. (I haven‚Äôt visited my GP or what their called in a very long time aka since feb)



I don‚Äôt mean to offend anyone by these statements above it‚Äôs what others always call me.. so if anyone also feels or gets treated this way.. how do you deal with it?"
"I've been taking a low maitinence dose of symbicort for a very long time, which manages my asthma really well. However, in recent years I was still having breathing difficulties to a degree because my nose was constantly blocked and my upper airways felt restricted in a way which made it difficult to get air in. So I recently started using rhinocort nasal spray (budesonide) and its made a huge improvement in my beathing and asthma in general. It was as if the symbicort was opening up my chest really well, but needed something extra for my upper airway. So yeah, just wanted to recommend this if anyone was experiencing similar problems"
"14yo male. About a month ago, While playing soccer, I got super tired after about a minute of running. Like extremely tired. I had never been tired that fast. I then had trouble breathing, my chest hurt so bad and felt like throwing up. It went away after half an hour or so. A few days later I realized my breathing wasn‚Äôt normal. Like I couldn‚Äôt breath when I thought about it. After some research I found out I have been hyperventilating ever since? Like when I think about my breathing. Should I be worried about having asthma? I don‚Äôt have any symptoms like wheezing or coughing. My chest hasn‚Äôt hurt since. Just hyperventilation. Should I  my parents and go see a doctor? Thanks!"

Im 35/M and ive had these sensations for about 2 years now."

"Switch over to an adult spacer with a face mask! I recently switched from my teddy bear yellow childhood spacer to this spacer:

"My kid needed a breathing treatment when she was a kid, short term. We‚Äôve used this nebulizer 3 times in that span. We have some tubes still in packaging, some masks, as well as lots of plastic vials with albuterol sulfate (expired Sep 18).

"I just commented this and am just going to paste it here as a post in case the guy who I commented it to isnt on. 

Hi I just want to thank everyone who has replied to me so much if you see this I love you. I wanted to say though. It's currently 4:30am I woke up because I couldn't breathe and the inhaler has helped a bit, I still feel a bit breathless and am coughing a lot. The inhaler helped in the sense of making me not feeling like I'm dying and can't breathe anymor to now just feeling breathless. Am I having an asthma attack? Is this bad or what is going on. What should I do?"
"I would consider my asthma pretty well controlled, these past few days I've experienced chest tightness and a tiny bit of shortness of breath that my xoponex isnt taking care of.  It hasn't gotten worse at all,  no wheeze or cough really. Just a forceful cough to try and clear up that tightness. Anyone ever have similar."
"2 months ago my dr told me he would be switching me from advair to wixela, also said they are pretty much the same but a different ingredient. But my mom is still on advair, has anyone else had to switch because of this? Its been working for me but I'm just curious"


"I have asthma that only happens a little bit of the time at around the same time every year at the summer (it's definetly something to do with hay-fever) Today I've just been feeling so wheezy, breathless and have done the spacer and inhaler thing 4 times today. I did it about 3 times yesterday. I got the inhaler last year so could it be out of date or something?

In the past I've had proper attacks before and had to go to hospital. Last year I was officially diagnosed with asthma in the covid unit did the inhaler once and never felt bad again (until this year) I've probably done the inhaler about 10 times in the past 3ish days and it helps for about an hour and then I feel bad again.

I just feel shit and I don't know why it's like it this year. Literally I've probably had like 3 inhalers in the past 5 years since I was first hospitalised and I've probably used them like twice in total (right up until now)

Also is my technique alright? I basically do the spacer, breathe in all the gas slowly and hold my breath for 10 seconds before I let it out. I do this twice.

This is far from the worst I have ever felt, it's just consistently bad even after doing the inhaler. Is that normal? How many times should I have to do the inhaler?"
"I'm seeing a pulmonogist soon for possible Asthma. I've been told by an Urgent Care doctor that she thinks I have Asthma. So right now I'm just waiting for my appointment couple of weeks to see the doctor. 

What symptoms did you guys have? I've been experiencing shortness of breath, chest tightness, persistent wheezing cough,  symptoms worse after exercise and at night. Certain triggers like for some reason Coke Cola makes me breathing worse. 

I bought one of those peak meter things, I'm not sure if I used it right cause after calculation it said i was at 49 percent but maybe I didnt use it right?

Its just frustrating waiting until my appointment to get a diagnosis."

"Hey, my wife is dealing with sudden asthma (had it as a kid and it came back) and one of the suggestions online is to get a pillow cover, but I've also heard mixed reviews on different filling being an issue for people with Asthma.

Is it reasonable to think two puffs of the OTC stuff is equivalent to the prescription stuff?"
"My first post on here, and sorry it‚Äôs a long one. I‚Äôm a 28 y/o Male, and I‚Äôve suffered with asthma for most of my life. I am also a sufferer of hay fever and have noticed, especially this year, my hay fever has been very bad (I live in the UK).
Last weekend, I noticed that I started to develop a tight chest. It then started to develop into a almost ‚Äúpounding sensation/flutters‚Äù as if I could feel my heart beat across my chest/shoulders, and my breathing felt just a little bit laboured. I‚Äôve had these symptoms, on and off, since Saturday. I‚Äôve had no pain and it hasn‚Äôt stopped or prevented me from working or go about my daily routine. But I‚Äôm just slightly concerned as to whether asthma/hay fever can cause this?

Back in October last year, I stopped using both my Seretide and Salbutamol completely, as my asthma has always been very well controlled and has never caused me any really problems. When I‚Äôve had my asthma checks annually, I have always been told my asthma is almost non-existent and extremely well managed.
However, I‚Äôve found since Saturday I‚Äôve been taking my inhalers to combat these symptoms which I believe could be more prominent due to my hay fever being quite severe this year; normally my hay fever is fairly minimal.

I‚Äôve spoken to my GP about my symptoms and he didn‚Äôt see any real concern and believes it could be asthma related. However, I‚Äôm just a bit anxious as to why I developed these symptoms suddenly and why it has been so prolonged? I do notice a difference when I take my inhalers (which I am now doing twice daily, with both my Seretide and Salbutamol). I‚Äôve also suffered with anxiety/panic attacks in the past and since these symptoms started, I have felt quite on edge. I suppose I‚Äôm just after a bit of clarification that I‚Äôm not the only person who has found their asthma flare up this year/Summer and that the symptoms I‚Äôm experiencing are maybe asthma and anxiety related?

Sorry for the long read, but TIA."
I'm in the US. Looking for the cheapest place online to buy nebulizer tubing and mouthpieces. Anyone have a good place? It really adds up. Thanks!
"I posted just a few days ago, and hinted in this direction, but thought I'd be more direct.

I'm not a professional athlete, nor an amateur. I'm not even particularly enthusiastic about my fitness, but I keep it up for general health reasons. I have a lot of questions around my exercise induced asthma and really can't find too many answers. 

Even though I take my two puffs before a work out, and that keeps my wheezing at bay, I've always felt like something is holding me back.  Sometimes during a work out it feels like there's a noticeable (but manageable) bit of obstruction in my breathing - not quite full on wheezing (and that's even with the rescue inhaler 20/30 minutes earlier).

I wonder is it my overall asthma condition, or something completely different. Right now I do HIIT on the indoor bike every other day for 30 minutes, and maybe swap in a 4-5K on road a few times a month. (and just to be clear I think my performance is way below my peers, like bottom 10% after doing this for a few years)

For those of you with regular cardio routines/sports, do you feel your medicated asthma is 100% a non-issue, or does it still impact your performance in some way? It's like the rescue medication keeps me from wheezing, but after that baseline is reached there's still a range of breathing performance where I may have a ways to go. 

TLDR: I'm not as good as I think I should be on the exercise bike. Could it be my ""controlled"" asthma and are there other actions to help besides the pretreatment with rescue inhaler?"
"I‚Äôm going to go my doctor of course.

To start with I‚Äôm not diagnosed with asthma, and I‚Äôve never been assessed for it, however I have wondered if I have it for most of my life.

I had an in home sleep study last night and one of the pieces of equipment was a pulse oximeter , an expensive medical grade one ($1000 when I looked it up) so it‚Äôs accurate.

I noticed that my o2 saturation hovered around 92-93% most of the time I was awake and was a bit alarmed when I read that this is kind of considered a cut off for hypoxia and definitely not normal.

I never feel I can take a satisfying breath, and I often have to lie down to breathe properly and feel dizzy. However I‚Äôve never been GASPING for breath so I thought that excluded asthma. It doesn‚Äôt feel like an emergency I just have to sit down after exercise and I can‚Äôt catch my breath ever which can make me really anxious and foggy too.
 
I have to split up my sentences to get my breath and I‚Äôve only recently realised that I do this. I sigh a lot and yawn a lot and I‚Äôm always tired (hence why I got a sleep study). The weirdest thing is when I woke up and looked at the monitor it was 97, but within minutes it had gone down to 92-93 range again. 

I‚Äôve ALWAYS felt like I need to sleep to get my breath back but I don‚Äôt understand why. When I‚Äôm awake I do stop breathing sometimes subconsciously so I wonder if it‚Äôs related. I also yawn and sigh all the time. Lying down didn‚Äôt increase my o2 but sleep did.

Could my breathing be dysfunctional and I‚Äôm hypoventilating? I‚Äôve never heard of that though 

Sorry if wrong sub couldn‚Äôt find a general one about breathing and I‚Äôm wanting to get to the bottom of this."
"Hey everyone,

My first (and likely only) post on here, as I was given instructions by my doctor to use the [asthma.org.uk](https://asthma.org.uk) guide regarding the peak flow diary I have to fill in. I am doing so as part of a military medical procedure. It has to be done for 7 days. Note I've had no problems with cardio or running in the past, and exercise regularly. My brother had childhood asthma but I have had no such problems at any point in my life. I have also done the Wim Hof Method on and off for the past few years, so I thought my lung capacity was pretty solid. I'm never out of breath, wheezy or cough a lot.

This was until I checked out what the 'normal' score for a 22 year-old male is supposed to be - at the 560-570 mark. I'm 60-70 away from that, and this has me worried for my future career in the armed forces. I'm not sure if my lungs are under-capacity for someone my age and if this could be a problem for my application, or if I'm just using the peak flow meter wrong and screwing up the technique, or if my lung capacity has gone down a bit since I haven't done the Wim Hof Method in about a year. What do you people think?

Thank you in advance."
"I've had some weird breathing issues since the beginning of last year. Long story short my doctor is trying to cancel out asthma as a possibility by prescribing me albuterol hfa with a spacer for 2 weeks. At first I didn't notice much of a difference, but now (3 days later), I almost don't need it anymore, and the year and a half long breathing issue is almost non existent.  


Honest question, can albuterol hfa ""cure"" or heal lung related issues that aren't related to asthma?   
For example: Say I actually ended up having a bacterial infection, could albuterol hfa have killed off the bacteria as an unintended side effect?"

This one?  


I recently discovered that using a spacer is really good for my asthma, so I went back to the spacers I had. My Aerochamber Plus Z Stat spacer didn't work for me, but the aerochamber MAX that I had worked. I just wanted to buy an extra one for safety, in case this one stopped working. My two questions are:  


1. Do they sell Aerochamber MAX still?
2. Why don't my old spacers work anymore?"
"Has anyone here experienced their asthma worsening really badly after stopping hormonal contraception? I have had mild asthma my whole life with flare-ups that happened maybe once very 3 or so years. I stopped taking birth control pills back in Sept of 2020 after being on them for \~ 4 years. Shortly after, my asthma went haywire and I've been struggling with my asthma since October of 2020 with multiple urgent care and doctor visits -- it has \*never\* been like this and it was very sudden. I've been analyzing what could have triggered this and I've been wondering if my hormonal drop could've contributed to my worsening asthma among the TONS of other symptoms I got after stopping the pill. Any experience would be appreciated."
I'm doing this in hopes of resolving some symptoms of stress
I was thinkin they got all these disposable vapes and i feel like they could be real useful if somebody made one into an albuterol vape. Seems like an interesting idea.

I know this sounds weird and I've had asthma since age 6 but it came back at age 21. I'm 22 and only had 2 inhalers my whole life because this is new to me. I am almost out of hits on my inhaler how do I go about getting a new one? Does my pharmacy have it after I got prescribed albuderal? Or do I have to make a qhole new appointment?
Have you any experience with it vaccine?
Do u think u got hit harder by the virus then normal people without asthma? How was it during the peek of the virus were u struggling to breathe? After recovery do u still suffer from symptoms? Or would u say having asthma wasnt a factor in worse symptoms?
"hi my fellow asthmatics! I just got put on a 5 day 40mg prednisone burst (started yesterday and last day will be saturday).

I have a concert that I am attending tomorrow and I was wondering if I will be able to drink at the concert? Obviously not planning to blackout but was curious to hear your opinion. thanks!"
"Just wondering. This includes getting the inhaler, shaking, putting it in spacer, breathing, and then putting inhaler back, and gargling."
"How often do you guys sterilize your nebulizers cups? 

I wash mine with warm soapy water after each use, but rarely sanitize. Am I putting myself up at risk of infection?"
How accurate are those things at home? Sometimes I get paranoid and when I feel like my breathing is off I‚Äôll check it as we should right? Sometimes just sitting here I will see it get to 95% but even at 97 I am worried. Are these things accurate at all? When I was in the hospital it was always at 100. I take Flovent and had to use albuterol once today. The heat here is getting to me where I live. I also want to mention is it normal for oxygen to lower when you are laying down from sitting/standing? Thanks I‚Äôm advance!
"Hey guys so last week I started a new job and so I'm dealing with alot of new triggers from that. I'm highly sensitive to smoke and to fragrance. The smoke hasn't been bad as there's 1 smoker and we don't sit close to each other. The fragrance, however, has been a real problem as you guys know people love to drench themselves in perfume and cologne. I was wondering, what are some suggestions you guys have for dealing with this?,"

I had asthma when I was little (26 now) but lately I'd been having attacks again so I went to see my GP and he told me my lungs weren't doing well and I had to get a puffer and see if I need to take daily medication. Now that I've been using the puffer for a few days I realize how difficult breathing has been for me for a while. What are some tips you can give me to help me handle my asthma?
I just started using Trelegy today and I just want to know people‚Äôs experience with it
"I only managed to sleep for 2 hours My bronchial tubes feel like they are inflamed, and fairly closed up. My chest feels tight, and slightly painful about a 0.75 out of 10. I'm coughing up a lot of clear mucus. I generally feel some what panicked, and unwell. I have used my salbutamol inhaler a total of twice within a 4 hours span with a total of 4 puffs. I have also taken a 200 mg ibuprofen tablet, and applied a significant amount of Vicks vaporub to the center of my chest."
"I was doing my lung function test and while I was listing off all my medication and the RT was really surprised to hear that I make Theophylline? According to him it's a older type of medicine?

I was just curious to see if anyone else takes this and if it is that rare to prescribe it."
"Curious - what time of day do you take Trelegy or any other maintenance inhaler?

I was previously on Breo and noticed I would get foggy headed around 7pm every day. I was taking Breo at 4pm. I switched to taking Breo at 8pm and didn‚Äôt seem to have the foggy head anymore. Then I switched to Trelegy and even though I‚Äôm taking it at night like I was with Breo, I‚Äôm getting foggy headed mid-day. I know Trelegy has different medications so I‚Äôm curious if there‚Äôs any best practices for when to take it.

TL;DR: Has anyone noticed that taking the maintenance inhaler at a certain time of day is better than other times of day? Curious about others experiences. TIA!"
"If so, what is your experience with it?  Has it helped your asthma? TIA"
"I just got out of the doctor's office and I'm feeling pretty frustrated. I recently came to the realization that hyperventilating while going on mild hikes was NOT normal and wanted to talk to my doctor because it's interfering with my ability to stay active and healthy. 
My PC could NOT get past my weight gain (15 lbs in 6-8 months from a sedentary covid life, coupled with working full-time and taking 8-10 credits a semester), and even when I tried telling her this was an issue that existed prior to weight gain, she wouldn't listen. Just because the threshold moved doesn't mean that the problem didn't exist. She said we'll do a follow up, but it's purely for monitoring the weight gain and she didn't mention the asthma again.
I've made an appointment with a specialist but I'm SO frustrated, she's never dismissed something like this before."
"My asthma is out of control and while I have plenty of sick time, my work‚Äôs policy is that every time you call out sick is an event and your fourth event is a write up. Two more after that and you‚Äôre fired. The only reason I didn‚Äôt hit that last year was covid changing some of the rules, but as restrictions are lifting I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs going to become an issue. Has anybody gone on intermittent FMLA for asthma? Is that something that would help me here? I don‚Äôt need more time off than I can accrue, I just need to be able to use it.

Also, if anybody has any experience with Fasenra or Nucala or any other end of the line therapies, I‚Äôd appreciate hearing about it. My blood tests are borderline and my asthma is mostly related to viral infections, but I do have environmental allergies and at this point we‚Äôre getting desperate - I‚Äôve maxed out other meds (highest dose of Symbicort and extra pulmicort when I have any exposure to triggers, plus Singulair and Zyrtec and I was worse on Breo, Advair, and Dulera, I‚Äôve tried Spiriva with no reduction in flares), and I‚Äôm still about to start my second prednisone burst for the month of June. You know how they say asthma kills people? I‚Äôm getting scared that I‚Äôm one of those people."
"I had a bad attack on Sunday probably induced by high pollen, ended up in A&amp;E. nebuliser stabilised me, I‚Äôm a bit touchy now and my chest hurts. They‚Äôve given me a 5 day course of steroids but I‚Äôm a bit worried to take them due to their side effects re mental health. Does anyone have any experiences of these they can share? 
I was diagnosed with Asthma around a year ago, after initially getting covid. I‚Äôve never had such a long attack and it‚Äôs all quite new to me still. 

Thanks in advance :)"
"For a bit of background info - I had asthma as a child that hasn‚Äôt been an issue since I was 12, I‚Äôm 27 now and have been suffering with a tight chest for a month and last night had to go to urgent care for a chest examination after contacting 111 (uk non emergency line). The doctor told me it was likely asthma back again or flaring up and prescribed steroid tablets to take for 6 days, and a ventolin inhaler which he told me to ignore what it said on the packaging and to take it as follows: day 1 - 6 puffs 6 times a day, day 2 - 5 puffs 5 times a day, day 3 - 4 puffs 4 times a day, day 4 - 3 puffs 3 times a day, day 5 - 2 puffs when needed.... so I read the instructions which completely goes against what he told me but did 6 puffs and my heart felt really loud kind of like palpating and I was really shakey... should I continue with what he said or could it be dangerous ?"
"Hey everyone, so I'm thinking I have Asthma. All the symptoms are there and it's causing me a lot of suffering. I just started a new job, so getting health insurance all set up was a pain, and the soonest I can get to the Dr is next Tuesday. What are some good tips to tie me over until I can get looked at professionally. Anything to help me sleep is a huge plus."

"Fellow asthma sufferers.  My asthma is ""under control"" now, however, I have to take the following everyday:

Montelukast

Cetirizine

Trelegy

Fluticasone Spray

Azelastine Spray

&amp;#x200B;

It's annoying to have to take so many things.  Can Medrol or Prednisone be used instead of having to take this cocktail everyday?

&amp;#x200B;

I do have an appointment next month and will ask about it also

Thanks"
"I have been smoking weed for almost everyday over the past couple years (taking breaks sometimes) and have recently suspected asthma symptoms like difficulty inhaling (almost like I can't yawn), heard wheezing a couple of times and am experiencing on and off shortness of breath throughout the day. I was wondering if this sounds like asthma. I started feeling the symptoms a lot more over the past couple of days, but they were mild before that."
"so my doctor thinks I have RAD (reactive airway disease) so I decided to see an allergist; I've been taking zyrtec, alvesco, symbicort, and literally none of this crap is working. The only symptom I get is chest tightness and wheezing. What would u recommend trying next? They don't have any idea what is triggering it :/."

"[New England, USA] I work in a school, year round. It's been hot and humid for a few weeks, and I've noticed that about halfway through the day I start to sound husky. They've been running the vents in the morning ""when it's cooler out"" and then turning on the AC around 1. It's been sort of tolerable, but today it was already 75¬∞F when I left my house at 5:15am and the humidity was already getting up near 60. 

I've been here for 30 minutes and I can tell I'm going to need to use my rescue inhaler to make it through the day. 

I don't want it to be like this all summer, but are my hands tied up just live with using my inhaler when it's hot and humid out? What are my options? Speak with facilities or my doctor? Or something else? Any sort of desktop device or something?"
"I've had lifelong asthma and mine has been acting up as of late and on top of that I've started a pretty rigorous (to me) exercise regime. I'm at a point where in the middle of my cardio, even after my pre-workout-two-puffs, I'm starting to feel a little tightness.  My yearly physical is a few months away. So I'm wondering is it just your regular practitioner who sets up your asthma action plan or can I make an appointment with a specialist to really nail down the action plan? And what kind of doctor does this?"
"I‚Äôve only been diagnosed with asthma for less than a year and have managed to avoid needing the rescue one much. Partially because I wasn‚Äôt going out much with lockdowns and partially since the one time I used it it messed with my voice for a few days (professional singer here). The last weeks here have been insanely high pollen count, and I‚Äôve now had two asthma attacks which needed the rescue inhaler in a week. Is that normal? Or should I chat to my lung doctor? I‚Äôm also on a daily preventative one (which I upped to twice a day since this pollen started). My asthma is allergy/exercise induced. Thanks! Definitely still learning my way through this!"
"So to keep my asthma in check, I have to have two different humidifiers, an air purifier, my room can't go below a certain temperature, and air fresheners, essential oils, and perfumes/body sprays are big triggers. 

Do you think it would be reasonable for me to request a private room of some kind? I know this is silly, but I don't want to sound entitled. I thought maybe getting some outside opinions would be helpful."
"Has anyone gotten Covid since getting both of their vaccines? I have the moderna vaccine and have pretty severe asthma and since the delta variant has been spreading like wild fire I‚Äôm a bit scared. I‚Äôm still very safe and don‚Äôt go out much, but my parents own a small business and are around a lot of people. Has anyone the has asthma gotten Covid and had the vaccine? I‚Äôm really scared since I‚Äôve never seen a person with asthma and the vaccine get Covid but I was wondering if anyone has any articles or stories that can help me understand the process a bit more!! Anything is helpful!!"
"Hi all,

I was under the impression that steroids were not good to use long term. But a doctor put me on Pulmicort after I had pneumonia when I was a kid (I already had asthma before the pneumonia, it just made it worse). I‚Äôm 19 now. I talked to my pcp about it and she said I shouldn‚Äôt stop taking it if it‚Äôs working. Am I wrong about steroids being risky long term? Thanks!"
"Hi all, I'm currently job hunting and have my first interview tomorrow for a supermarket, 11-20 hours a week (I have a good feeling about it). Previously this year I worked in a pub but not for very long (literally 4 weeks?), I ended up actually getting fired by my SUPER toxic bosses but I was \*this\* close to quitting anyway. My asthma was the reason they sacked me - I had a sudden onset SEVERE asthma attack and got sent home by the senior member of staff who was on hand, ended up having to go on a twice-daily steroid inhaler as a result. My two bosses decided it was ""unacceptable"" for me to ""take off without telling anyone just because you have a little cough"" (even after the member of staff who sent me home told them everything), ""a bit rude"" I didn't tell them I was on steroids when they hired me (even though it was AFTER the attack that I was on steroids) and then have ""the audacity"" to get vaccinated, so I lost the job. I know it's illegal for them to fire me over my asthma but I'm so bloody over it and was literally going to hand in my notice that day anyway, the job was so flawed in so many ways. Don't really have the energy to fight it.

However, the crap experience I had at the very short-lived pub stint has made me worried that if I did have another asthma attack at a new job, I wouldn't be properly supported and it would put my health (and customers'/other staff members) at risk, but I'm nervous about asking. I'm not really sure if having a health condition like asthma would get me a little bit of extra help, for example having a manager who understands how serious an asthma attack can be and let me go home if I need to. I'm also kind of worried that an employer will hear the word ""asthma"" and decide to hire someone else over me. I don't need masses of support, it just worries me I'll have someone who doesn't understand the severity of an attack if I did have another one whilst I was working. 

Does anyone have experiences of informing their employer about their asthma? Is there anything in the law about support for employees who have health conditions such as asthma and if they can receive any support or just have a bit more empathy?"
"As the title says... I am 36 years old... This has been pretty difficult. I run a lot(ran I guess). Pre-covid, I completed my first marathon. 3.5 hours, not too shabby. Now I can't play with my kids for 5 minutes without difficulty breathing. Doctor gave me Albuterol inhaler but it was almost 4 weeks before they could get me in for a spirometry and the symptoms just got worse and worse. Got the spirometry results and I guess it's asthma. Anyways the doctor prescribed budesonide. I'm using it twice per day for about 10 days and the results a pretty good I guess but how long does it take to feel normal. Is asthma all the time? My symptoms have been 24/7 for easily a month now.. will I ever be able to run again."
"this might be way longer than it needs to be, but i like to explain things in full depth to the best of my ability. my mom has horrid allergies and asthma, and growing up i realized i took her genetics with the allergy half, but never noticed any breathing problems. here and there every few years i would get an upper respiratory infection and i would be put on a nebulizer to help with difficulty breathing and given a temporary inhaler, but i wouldn‚Äôt really use it because the infection would go away within a couple days. this has happened maybe two or three times my whole life. when i was about fourteen or fifteen, i was super depressed and i picked up smoking marijuana, at first, it was an occasional treat, but over the past year since quarantine started, i‚Äôve been a very regular user. never smoke cigarettes, but i do vape nicotine, like very regularly. you could say i have a dependency. not as bad as some, but not the best either. and i‚Äôve kept up these habits for about three or four years now without an issue at all (a couple coughs here and there, mucusy throat from the vape occasionally)

but this weekend. god this weekend has been quite awful. three nights ago, i was coughing a bit, but it wasn‚Äôt painful, more like i had to clear my throat. but it became more and more consistent throughout the night to the point where i was wheezing and it was unbearable. the wheezing and coughing was non stop and i had to call out of work for the entire weekend. today, it wasn‚Äôt any better so my dad drove me to urgent care. they listened to my breathing with a stethoscope. immediately, the doctor told me ‚Äúthat‚Äôs asthma. you have asthma. it‚Äôs not an infection (like i previously assumed)‚Äù they let me use their nebulizer and it was AMAZING the wheezing totally went away within the five minutes i was using it. but i don‚Äôt own my own nebulizer. it‚Äôs been a few hours and the inhaler i‚Äôve been given by my pharmacy isn‚Äôt helping as much at all. i don‚Äôt have a prescription for the abuterol sulfate liquid either, as i‚Äôve only been given the inhaler and a weeks worth of prednisone. 

does anyone have any advice? i can‚Äôt go to a doctor for another two weeks and the wheezing is killing me. i don‚Äôt have access to the nebulizer."
"Hi folks- having some major asthma problems over the past year. I‚Äôm 36, dx at 15, historically didn‚Äôt need a maintenance inhaler and only used my rescue inhaler during spring and fall when my allergies were bad or I was sick. 

Last summer I started needing it to use albuterol every day so I got oral steroids. Still didn‚Äôt get better, second round of steroids, found a new doc, started a maintenance inhaler (Flovent) which helped a bit but not much. Flovent still left me feeling breathless so my primary doc sent me to an allergy and asthma specialist who prescribed Symbicort which gave me thrush almost immediately. Thrush treatment tore up my stomach so the allergy doc switched me to Breo which has no also given me thrush- and I‚Äôm still breathless much of the time. Symbicort helped the most but continuing it was untenable with the cycle of thrush/stomach problems from treating thrush. 

What do I do?? Any tried and true thrush cures so I can keep using inhalers that actually help?

Thanks!!"
"I have been dealing with asthma since i was super young, im 16 now and i still deal with it. I normally have a nose full of mucus and i sneeze a lot. I have also noticed that i have a really hard time breathing in old indoor places or if a run a lot. I have tried changing around my diet and exercising almost everyday, these things didnt make it worse but didnt make it any better ether. What else can i do to make it better?"
"I've been on Advair pretty much ever since it was introduced on the market (250/50 Diskus) and I'm looking to get off corticosteroids and try a different control method. I think the only other option is a leukotriene modifier, like Singulair. 

Just wondering if any long-term Advair users have switched to an LM instead and how did it go? 

Also curious if anyone has been able to totally ditch their control med altogether? I read some studies that came out (specifically about corticosteroid control meds) that said in the long run they didn't offer any better quality of life than using short term control inhalers (like Albuterol). I don't know if my asthma is mild enough for that but I'm really tired of the side effects of corticosteroids."
About 6 months ago I was formally diagnosed and put on Advair and it‚Äôs done wonders. Had symptoms for years and all went away. But my 6 month prescription is out this month and I‚Äôm now wondering if I need to go back and renew the prescription at the doc or is it a short term medication and it‚Äôll be fixed for a while? It‚Äôs the 100/50 dose. Thank you.
"Anyone have any suggestions on methods or technique to improve breath capacity?  
I would like to learn how to sing. But I know I do not have the breath capacity to really start without building it up.   
I have heard from someone that panting like a dog can work. But they did not say much else."
"I keep telling my doctor my asthma is out of control and ruining my life. He put me on a pill that didn't really help and caused really scary breaks in reality, aggression, suicidal behavior and thoughts. I'm tethered to my salbutimol and I can't live my life. It's been like this since I was a kid. Everyone said it would go away. It got worse. 

I have to call an ambulance every time my inhaler runs out. Every 6 months to a year, my backup plans fail and I'm left crying in a fucking ambulance. It just happened again. I'm shaking from the drugs and my nose is bleeding and I'm just so sick of living like this. 

What do I do?? My doctor seems to shrug it off like he doesn't understand this thing has not killed me but it runs my whole life. Everything I do is strategically planned to not piss off my lungs. I take the salbutimol admittedly far too often but the alternative is... just don't breathe? I'm sick of pestering the poor paramedics. Im sick of saying I can't do this I can't do that. I just want to be normal. Seriously, please, I'm losing my mind and I don't know what to do."
"So I took a puff of my inhaler a few minutes ago and a couple minutes later- not thinking- I had a couple sips of water. I heard you‚Äôre not supposed to do that, so should I be worried? I know that I‚Äôm probably being overly paranoid but I wanted to make sure ."
"I‚Äôm looking for some advice, fellow wheezy people.

In the last week of may, I left work in an ambulance with an asthma attack that I couldn‚Äôt fix with my rescue. I had never been that bad before, my whole body was tingling, I felt exhausted, had wheezes when I was breathing, the works. Got some duoneb and a lot of steroids and was ok, then saw my primary doctor who put me on advair and scheduled a PFT. 

The results of the PFT came back today, and my doctor says that they don‚Äôt show I have asthma and she wants me to stop taking the advair to see how things go. I‚Äôm pretty bad off without it and I can usually mark exactly 12 hours between doses because I start getting tight in my chest and coughing a lot. Any ideas everyone? Has anyone else had something like this happen? I‚Äôm averaging about 5 rescue uses per week right now and I don‚Äôt think stopping the advair is a great idea."
"I hated using the red inhalers because they would always stop working almost halfway through. Saw that post and so much later on, same bs with my inhaler. Took a q-tip and the build up came off and it works!!! Feeling kinda dumb for throwing away so many half used containers.
To op that posted that advice, you‚Äôve literally saved my life!"
"I used to have really bad asthma when I was a kid like under 10 years old (I‚Äôm 19 and otherwise healthy guy). I would have to get hospitalized a lot for it whether it be from cats or cold weather or sickness but for some reason as I got older it didn‚Äôt really affect me as much, I would get a little wheezy if I was running and my chest would get a little tight if I was around animals for a while but that‚Äôs about it. Lately since a couple weeks of moving into my new apartment and for the last 2 months my chest has been tight and I‚Äôve been focused on my breathing constantly I also have bad anxiety and I‚Äôve been getting lightheaded when at work. I‚Äôve been very worried that my asthma will / is getting worse. If I cough my lungs will sounded irritated but I don‚Äôt have the urge to cough very often. I was going to the gym before and playing basketball outside but have been too worried to do those things again. Is the odds of my asthma getting back to that point pretty low? And is it common for kids with severe asthma to get better when they get older?"
"My doctor recently prescribed me singulair for my asthma &amp; allergies. I'm a bit nervous to take it, what are the experiences of those who have taken it and was it effective?"
"i‚Äôve been going to the doctor on and off since december for wheezing, heart pain, brown/dark phlegm, fatigue, shortness of breath, etc. 

i vape (3 days clean, wish me luck ^-^) and smoke weed (daily) , so i was surprised when my chest x-ray came back clear.

i did the lil test where u breathe into a big tube and it was confusing. i couldn‚Äôt exhale for very long but after my doctor came in said i did great and that i have some type of functioning daily asthma ? idk what she said exactly 

but now i use albuterol and flovent , the albuterol helps immensely, before i got the flovent i was using the albuterol every 4 hours. the flovent makes it to where i only need the albuterol like once a day. 

does this actually sound like asthma ? i assumed i was developing copd or something (which is a reach considering i‚Äôm 18)

also i‚Äôm pretty sure i haven‚Äôt had covid ? i‚Äôve been tested whenever i had scares before i was vaccinated and it was always negative , same for whoever was getting tested with me at the time. 

also, i was left with only my flovent for a couple days and i started to feel like i couldn‚Äôt breathe"
"I've had my IQAir unit for close to a decade now, and even got it on sale for $800USD. The problem is IQAir now seems to be producing their pre-filters on the cheap. The most recent pre-filter, and a replacement pre-filter that IQAir sent me have both produced significant chemically irritating odors that filled my house, and caused me to have a significant asthma attack. The point of an air purifier is to clean my air not produce chemical odors to exacerbate my asthma. The chemical odor makes even less sense when you take into consideration that the IQAir air purifier unit comes with a carbon filter to remove odors...The very not helpful support representative even told me that running my IQAir air purifier in a garage till the chemical odor ceased was a good fix to my problem...Again this is an air purifier I'm taking about. I would never want my IQAir unit in any area that is dirty since I keep this unit in my bedroom where I sleep which is a hypoallergenic environment, and not a garage. 

TL;DR I am need assistance finding the best air purifier on the market since IQAir is now probably about to fold, and likely go bankrupt, or at the very least no longer produce air purifiers. I have a decent budget for air purifiers, but I would prefer to not go over $900USD. I might go over $900USD if the filters for the best air purifier were not excessively expensive."
"So, I normally get Ventolin but was given a generic one recently. The generic one doesn‚Äôt seem to work for me as well as Ventolin does. I‚Äôve been pushing my doctor to give me Ventolin again and she has been really dismissive saying that they‚Äôre basically the same thing.

"Probably a lot of you guys have to endure this current heat wave in Europe so I am opening this post for everything related to it.

I'll go first. It sucks, my breathing was really great I was feeling amazing I just finished my 2 weeks after 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine and now this heat wave came. As temperatures started rising I started feeling worse every day. Last night I could barely sleep as both heat and asthma kept waking me up. I am constantly in air conditioning but I don't keep it too cool nor do I sit directly under it so in my room it is about 27 degrees celsius. I have awful cramps in my abdomen and in my legs and arms. I can't eat. I am really tired and all I can do is just lay all day. On top of the heat there is Saharan sand and little particles in air, so at night I can't even open window to let any fresh air. I'll have to sleep under AC this night as it is barely livable for me at the moment.

Now you go. Open your chest (hehe), complain. Or just write any advice. Post memes. Whatever you like. And remember, this shall pass too and we'll survive just like everything else.

Sending love to all my asthmatics that are struggling and those who are not. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª

My advice is: take your therapy, use your peak flow meters, relax and rest , don't exercise too much, take in a lot of fluids (specially those sports drinks with electrolytes), eat fruits and veggies, if you can don't leave AC rooms, don't be in sun, sleep if you feel like it, and most important don't stress too much."
"So my asthmatic husband (19M also not really my husband yet) woke having trouble breathing and he can‚Äôt find the mouthpiece/medicine cup to his nebulizer. So he asked for my defuser I was pulling out of storage for the bugs. So after I clean and sterilize it (so it doesn‚Äôt spread germs) I hand it to him and he sit on the couch using it with his Medicine. I (24m)have work endured asthma so Unless you are making me run a mile I am fine. So I don‚Äôt really know if this can work, I ask him if I should take him to urgent care or the er. He goes ‚Äúno they well just put me on a nebulizer then when I am sleepy from the medicine tell me I am full of shit because I am supposed to feel hyper.‚Äù I am like yeah the nebulizer part is kinda the point so you can breath and he like nah this is fine. So fast forward 6 hrs of work later I came home to a still wheezing partner and again the argument of nebulizer vs defuser continues I am trying to do some research so I have an excuse and a research paper  so I can drag him too a doctor but my search came up nothing and now we arrive at the question of can a defuser work as a nebulizer for asthma

Tl;dr does a defuser work as a nebulizer because husband refuses to go to doctor"
"My doctor recently put me on Spiriva in addition to my advair and albuterol, nebulizer and singulair. Anyone have success with Spiriva? Is there a noticeable difference over time? Side effects? I‚Äôm 27, and the same doctor has been treating my asthma since I was diagnosed at 3. I‚Äôve been well controlled with advair and albuterol for the last 15ish years besides having exercise induced attacks, which I explained to him and he decided to add Spiriva. He gave me about 5mos worth of samples to try out. Just wondering if anyone else has noticed a positive change with it."
"i am a 17 y/o M ive been smoking weed for a while now (couple of years) the first time i smoked i wasnt any older than 12, but i didnt start smoking everyday untill my freshmen year of high school plus ive had my fair share of counterfeit carts, but last December a few days before my birthday i had taken a bong rip and layed in my bed, out of no where i got this twitching pain in my side, i though it was just a side effect of the big rip i took, i took a 4 month tolerance break but it never stopped,  about a month or 2 ago it finally stopped but i have a severe pain in my left lung, sometimes it feels like it is growling almost, i know it sounds dumb, when i lay down i feel both of my sides rumbling almost, i have been coughing up black mucus but that is just my body clearing out my lungs, doing activity doesnt really make it worse, only sometimes when i bend over or relax in a seat. Ive been to multiple doctors none of them have been able to diagnose me i feel like they dont take me serious, one said it was a muscle strain, one said it could be my stomach ulcers, and one said it could be the lining of my lung, they all gave me Ibuprofen or antibiotics, none of them have worked. I recently tried smoking again but the pain i get when i do is unbearable. I just want to sit and hold my side while it aches the whole time, when i wake up in the morning i feel like i almost cant catch my breath, if i take deep breaths in and out i get super light headed or my body starts to kinda shake with a deep breath, i also get random shocking pains in my heart, ive had a EKG recently and i do have an irregular heart beat, also i had a pretty serious lung infection 2 years back that im pretty sure was covid but before we even knew about it every since my rig cage has been very tender and hurts to push down on. Im just trying to find some help or advice anyway possible because the doctors around my area havent helped at all. (Plus my dad recently got fired so i cant take anymore hospital trips)"
"Had a severe attack and ended up fainting. I think I was out for around 3-5 minutes. Last time this happened I rushed to a doctor and they said I was fine after freaking out about a heart attack. I'm younger so I'm not worried about that. 
I'm nervous this time though because I woke up due to the fact that it felt like my body was shaking uncontrollably. I was home alone so I can't be positive but does this happen to anyone else? 
Also would go see a doctor, but lost my job and my health insurance so I'd rather get some feedback before racing over there to put myself in even more debt."
"So I‚Äôd been given the general and then intubated for the procedure with a breathing tube down my throat and they did their thing and I was breathing fine. Then afterwards they removed the tube. I wake up really groggy and gasping for breath, can‚Äôt talk, can‚Äôt sit up, panicking. It takes a while for me to work out it‚Äôs a major asthma attack and longer still for me to tell them that because they are thinking I‚Äôm just doing usual general wake up stuff with a sore throat. Argh!!  
All fine now, but yeah make sure (unlike me) that you have an asthma plan just in case even if, like me, you usually only get mild and easily controlled asthma. I‚Äôve had generals before and haven‚Äôt had this so hopefully it was a freak occurrence.  Next time I‚Äôll use my asthma preventer 3 times a day for a week beforehand. I usually only use it if there are bushfires or something major happening with the air."

"My sibling ordered too much albuterol awhile back. his son has outgrown the use of the albuterol solution (that you put into a machine). Does anyone know a place who could use this medicine? i'll donate it for free and drive within my state. I am in CT/MA often. It's prob. $100s of dollars but it is expired. medicine doesn't really have an expiration date. if you know of a place who will take the donation, pls let me know."
"I feel it particular when breathing out, towards the end of the breath. It almost feels like something is in there, kind of like how one can get mucus in the throat - but in the lungs of course. I don't cough up anything, I don't know that I cough any more when I'm ""on the feeling"" than when I'm not. My ability to breathe in is not restricted, if my ability to breathe out is hindered, I hardly notice.

I wouldn't call it tightness, shortness, or anything, so what would you call it to a doctor?

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions."

"So. Had an asthma attack at work last Thursday, after much testing and worry as to why my lungs felt like they were full of angry bees but sounded fine it turns out I freaking SPRAINED MY RIBS from the asthma attack. 

PSA: So. That's a thing that happens."
Do I need to get spirometry or another device? The closest spirometry is 200km from where we live so I'm looking to get a measuring device at home to be able to give the doctor updates without having to travel 200km to do so

"I (21F) was suspected of having exercise induced asthma since middle school when I had severe difficulty running track in gym class and on the track team. I'm talking wheezing, coughing, metallic taste, chest pains, etc. when I would run or jog just a quarter mile. My doctor wanted me to see a specialist before talking about an inhaler but since I was overweight at the time it was more or less dismissed right there as an out of shape issue.

Got covid last year and my suspected asthma got a lot worse so my doctor caved and prescribed me an albuterol inhaler. 

Since then, I've competed Couch to 5K and have run multiple complete 5Ks with taking two puffs before exercise. My most recent 5K run last week had an average pace of 10:30 per mile. With only 30 doses left of my inhaler, I've been thinking about going off of it since I am doing so well. Never mind that I've never ran without using it beforehand.

Then came about an hour ago. Got out of class and got a weather alert that it was going to torrentially rain in about 10 minutes. To takes me 15-20 minutes to walk the two-thirds of a mile back to my place so I thought I could run it and make it before it rained. My inhaler was not with me.

Well, less than 2-3 minutes of jogging, my throat was so sore and my chest hurt. My breathing sounded so awful and raspy. I had to stop to catch my breath and I just wheezed for a solid 30 seconds. Then I speed walked for a minute or two and heard a thunderclap. Attempted to run again. This time it took me 2 minutes to feel like I was breathing through a straw. Switched to speed walking. Then I felt some rain starting to come down. Decided to give it another go and made the light to cross the intersection. At this point, my throat and chest hurt so bad and my legs were trembling...*from like 2 minutes of running/jogging with walks inbetween* As I said, I literally ran a 5K was a good time last week and could have ran further no problem. 

Then it started to downpour so I just full speed ran to my place less than two blocks away. I was getting lightheaded and my breathing was atrocious sounding. Finally got to my building's lobby and was kneeling over to catch my breath for a solid 2 minutes.

That was an hour ago. My throat and chest still hurts/are sore. I coughed up a fair bit of phlegm. But it just makes me realize how much the inhaler has been helping me and that it my suspected asthma is very much still there. Sorry for the long post but it was just a very abrupt reality check for me."
"This is definitely a question for my doc, but she‚Äôs not super responsive on mychart, so maybe you can help me! I was recently diagnosed with EIB. I got an albuterol inhaler with directions to take 2 puffs prior to runs or other vigorous exercise. My question is how much is too much? Like per week? If I run 4-5 times per week, is it ok to use albuterol that often? I keep seeing warnings online not to use it too frequently but does that apply to preventative use for exercise induced asthma? Also related, I think I‚Äôm affected by late stage EIB. Albuterol prevents the coughing directly following runs, but I frequently experience shortness of breath 10-14 hours later. Any advice for that? This is all new to me. I‚Äôve thought I‚Äôve had EIB for years, but prior to moving to the desert, I was able to prevent most symptoms by warming up, running with a mask, etc. Thanks!"
"Hi guys,

The doctor is calling me tomorrow but would really appreciate some advice in the meantime. I was around smokers a week last Friday, then I cleaned the house and then I done a workout and my chest pain &amp; cough had gotten progressively worse. I am not wheezing and can take a full breathe which is a little painful. But my cough is dry and constant and burns. No wheezing. Anything I could do to help? Think this is an asthma flare up?"
"Hey Asthma Community. Maybe you can help me post this elsewhere as well:   

   

General health: I'm a 31 year old male, healthy diet, healthy weight. I just took lung capacity tests and i've received 110% of regular. I walk an hour a day, try to get more intensive exercise but it is very difficult for me to over exert because I have a rare neuromuscular condition that causes periodic paralysis (basically all day) and if I work out too hard it can put me out for a day or two totally. I'm currently on disability for this. I do do push ups, sit ups and muscle toning at home as well as yoga/meditation daily.

Meds: Flecainide 100mg 3x daily for Myotonia Congenita, Omeprazole daily, Alprazolam 5mg at night to sleep, Wellbutrin.  My myotonia causes a lot of anxiety/depression.  

   

Issue: As a child I was diagnosed with asthma. I took my nebulizer every morning and after before going to school. I've tried every asthma medicine under the sun and for 31 years i've basically survived off a rescue inhaler. I take is 6-10x a day. I cannot ever get a deep breath, sitting down for 2 hours and I need an inhaler. Go for a walk, I lose my breath. We've tried everything. Pneumologists, Primary Care, Allergy/Asthma doctors. Now I'm trying Psychiatry....I cannot find out why I can't breathe properly, literally ever. I assume it's related to the Mytonia somehow but nobody else with this condition experiences this. My pneumologist is just telling me its all in my head and hasn't offered any real advice, I do like him and trust him but he hasn't really been ""helpful"" aside from telling me it's not asthma.  

   

Any ideas? Sorry for the rant, i'm just desperate to find a way to breath well."
"Just curious if anyone else gets really restless, like can't sit still, when they have an asthma flare."
"Insane coughing fit last night. Lasted about an hour. I would cough so hard that I‚Äôd lose my breath, get light headed, heart racing, chest burning. It was sort of like a tickle in my throat but lower. This morning, the cough is better, but my chest is really sore. Wheezing a little. Never had asthma before but I get short of breath easily. 
Also, my heart doc said I should try edibles instead of smoking THC. Stopped smoking 6 months ago. I had edibles yesterday.  (Yes, the coughing fit was brought on by a laughing fit, because, you know, THC. But I‚Äôve never felt THAT bad after laughing.)
AND I was exposed to covid just three days ago, though I‚Äôve received both Moderna vaccines. 
Maybe I‚Äôm just paranoid (thanks THC and exposure) or maybe I should get tested for covid or asthma?"
"I‚Äôve used Alvesco since 2018, and it‚Äôs always empty when the counter says it has 20-25 actuations left. When I first started using it, I thought I just had a defective inhaler or that I was imagining it, but it‚Äôs been a problem with every single one. My chest tightens around 25 actuations, which resolves when I start a new inhaler.

Does anyone else have this issue? Am I doing something wrong in terms of squeezing out the last drops of medication?"
"Started Vyvanse recently. Breathing has been worse. Reckon it's seasonal allergens but thought I'd ask here just in case.

Are stimulant meds known to have any effect upon asthma?"
"I haven't received a diagnosis of asthma, I'm still really new at all these medications. I've had breathing problems for a year, especially at night, saw a pulmonologist and she prescribed Advair 250/50 2x a day and Albuterol. I used the Albuterol before exercise about 6 hours ago as that's what she said to do before exercise, and then I was supposed to take the Advair now before bed. But I wasn't thinking and just started taking a puff of the Albuterol üò© Does anyone have experience with this? I wish I could call a pharmacist but it's almost midnight.."

The doctor prescribed me albuterol and Zyrtec because she believed my symptoms are due to asthma and allergies. So I went home and took two puffs as well as one pill and am still having difficulty taking deep breaths and yawning. What do I do? I cant sleep:/
"I just remembered about when I first started my preventer inhaler, me and my boyfriend were discussing the possible side effects to which I told him thrush was one. His fantastic solution to this was to not ‚Äúspray it down there‚Äù. I just thought i‚Äôd share this in case anybody hadn‚Äôt thought of this before!"
"I recently got diagnosed with eosinophilic asthma, and the treatment requires an at-home injection every two weeks. I get really nauseous and dizzy around needles, so I'm both terrified of doing it, doing it wrong, and that I'll start to do it and just pass out! I'm also just generally nervous about the treatment and don't particularly trust my pulmonologist, which obviously doesn't help. 

The specific medication/brand is Dupixent, I'm not sure if it is more specific than that or if that is just one brand of a common medication?

Has anyone else done this treatment, and do you have any experiences you'd be ok with sharing? Does anyone have advice for giving yourself an injection when you're extremely scared of needles, and particularly if you faint? I was looking at one of those 'Buzzy the Bee' things, and some of the other items that supposedly help, but I don't know how helpful they really are. Would love to hear from personal experience!"
"I've been a chronic asthma sufferer nearly all my life.  I'm early 40s now and was diagnosed after a particularly bad bout of pneumonia when I was 8.  I've always struggled with my small airway numbers... fev1 has always been in the botton 15%.  I've been on singulair/flovent and then Advair since 2000.  Advair has always been my go to, but after reading about small airway versions of asthma and extra-fine particle medicines I wanted to try Trelegy.  

I haven't had a full lung function test yet, but my PF is up 10-15% in almost any given situation.  Cardio is easier and deep breathing effort is severely reduced.  It's been a big change for me day to day.

I hope this data point can be useful to someone."
"I have been doing pretty good on my anxiety lately! But here is the thing, when my breathing feels off I cannot tell at times what is asthma and what is my overthinking about my breathing make sense? Sometimes it seems if I focus on my breathing I forget how? I hope this is relatable. I never thought about my breathing until I was diagnosed either. And when it is bad like this, it seems it INSTANTLY goes away if I take a puff on albuterol so I cannot tell if I am mentally fixated on that or if it IS that. Does this make sense? It just feels like my breathing is not automatic.. my exhale is a little funky and then I can get some congestion at times too, but the congestion NEVER was there until flovent was given. Can these inhalers cause mucus production? Never was an issue before. Ugh the trials and errors and trying to understand. It is nice knowing I am not alone at times, but so hard to know the difference of things. I often at times feel my stomach is just too full and that affects my breathing too. I hope I can adapt to this one day or it just gets better. I just need some hope because on days like today I am losing it. It also marks the 2 years my fist Uncle died and two months my second Uncle died after him.. two years ago. I was very close to them and I am not sure if that too us playing on it. I do remember though my breathing was NOT like this when they passed. I didn't have ""asthma"" then. Just still searching for answers. I had a appointment to see an pulmonologist but they called and said he is on vacation and only works so many days a week so now I can't get in until July 14th! A respiratory therapist is who first diagnosed me so I have yet to see a specialist. Still so new to all this. I am scared at times.. thank you for your kindness on here from ALL you! I am not sure where I would be without this."
"Hi everybody,

I'm really not sure if what is going on with me is asthma, or something that just sort of looks like it. 

A little bit of background... I was ""diagnosed"" with ""sports induced asthma"" (it was the 90's) when I was 13.  I don't know if you could really call it a proper diagnosis though.  I said I had shortness of breath when exercising, so they had me run around outside, come in, and blow into a tube.  Sent me home with a rescue inhaler and told me to use it before exercise and when needed.  I tried this.  It never helped.  I used a spacer, I tried doing more than the 2 puffs.  Everything.  The inhaler never once helped me.  So I learned to work around my breathing issues.  I quit playing team sports and stuck to biking and swimming, where I could stop and not worry about letting others down.  I have never once ever had breathing issues outside of exercise.  And I grew up in wild fire county, with cats, and every other allergen you can think of.  This isn't actually the issue, but I thought I'd include it as maybe it's meaningful. Maybe I have exercise induced asthma, maybe I don't.  I'm less concerned about that as it's something I've managed and more concerned with the following:

14 months ago, I started noticing that my breathing felt weird.  It was uncomfortable, or labored.  It just wasn't right.  Felt like I was breathing gas.  It slowly got worse.  Doctor took one look at me and said ""asthma.""  Sent me home with symbicort.  Which I tried for a couple weeks, but it made me cough so much and my symptoms got worse while on it.  So I stopped.  I tried alvesco for a month.  Zero improvement.  It just kept slowly getting worse. At first it was only at night.  Now it's 24/7.  I literally never feel normal.  It gets worse at night.  The ONLY thing that gives me any sort of relief, is a steamy shower.  And even then, it doesn't go away, it just doesn't feel as bad.  I feel a tightness in my chest sometimes as well.  It kind of feels like I'm breathing through a filter.  Like I can get the air in, it just doesn't feel smooth and easy.  I had a spirometry test.  It showed ""mild obstruction.""  I've had two scopes at the ENT, an endoscopy, a 24hr ph montitor, and a stress test.  Everything is normal.

I was also given 5 days of prednisone as an ""just in case."" But never actually told to take it.  I don't want to take prednisone unless it really seems like I have asthma and need it.

I'd be fine to accept an asthma diagnosis, but here are my issues that make me question that.  

1. This feeling came on over night (and slowly has worsened).  I know the exact date.  It was very noticeable.
2. I've never had breathing issues outside of exercise,
3. Inhalers have not helped and even have made things worse.
5. I don't wheeze, and rarely cough.
6. I've had a persistent sore throat for 10 months.

I thought I'd ask some people who suffer from asthma regularly if this seems like asthma? It doesn't feel the same as when I can't breathe during exercise.  I've been slowly getting worse for 14 months and now breathing is constantly uncomfortable.  Which puts me in the category that doctors like to ignore.  I'm not urgent enough for them to worry about, but I'm miserable.

Thoughts?

Thanks!"
"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôve been having some debilitating chest pain while doing ANY cardio. It goes away within 10-15 minutes after I stop. Ventolin doesn‚Äôt help. Heart issues have been ruled out so my doctor is adding on Atrovent to my routine of 2 puffs of Flovent twice a day. 

Is anyone also on these two meds?"
So for a long 5 months I been going through a series of bad night wheezing that causes me to cough up brown mucus sometimes. I get heat waves and it‚Äôs very hard to breathe my inhale and exhale are whistles and screams. Coughing and yawning give me sharp piercing feelings in the spine and chest. All my CT scans and chest xRays are normal even my spirometry test was somewhat normal. I went through 11 different medications from doctor and every thing on the counter that‚Äôs supposed to treat my symptoms. No luck at all. Used the prednisone pills for weeks nothing tons of allergy meds nothing. The ER gave me a cough suppressant syrup called hycodan and my airways cleared like never before and my wheezing left for a solid 7-8 hours. I felt cured. But why is it the only thing helping me has to be an opioid syrup ?  Any suggestions?
"So, a little bit of history. As i kid, i would very often get bronchitis. I would have dust allergies all the time. Cetrizine and loratadine were my go-to, in addition to antibiotics. As I grew up, i pretty much became better in this regard. I‚Äôm 25 now and I usually take anti-histamines only like maybe 5-6 times a year (maybe for a couple of days when it gets bad). 

In the last 5 years, i would go for occasional runs and at a time i could even run upto 4km non-stop. (It‚Äôs not great but whatever). 


All through last year, i barely did any cardio. Owing to the pandemic, i kept myself indoors, and the little exercise i did were pushups. 

I started going for runs again, and i find myself in a very bad condition. Idk if it‚Äôs anything serious, or just a lack of fitness.  My chest starts burning after like 0.75km of running. My legs have not given in at all. It‚Äôs my lungs that‚Äôs the bottleneck. I ran 1.5km yesterday, and my chest still feels a bit tight right now. I had a bit of mucus and coughs after running, but that subsided immediately. 

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs serious or just allergic bronchitis"
"40-something, asthmatic since infancy, severely asthmatic as a kid but well-controlled with meds and environmental controls for the last decade (since identifying many food triggers). 

I am severely lactose-intolerant and have a milk allergy. Even trace amounts of lactose in medications will trigger a serious reaction. While this allergy was easily manageable for a long time, about 6 years ago it became so severe that I absolutely can‚Äôt take meds with lactose any more. 

I‚Äôve been taking montelukast for about a decade, in addition to a cocktail of other meds (symbicort, nasonex, Allegra, plus Benadryl most evenings, and occasionally sudafed). However, most formulations of montelukast (including the name brand) contain lactose. Once I discovered the worsening milk allergy, I switched to a manufacturer that doesn‚Äôt use lactose (kremer, which now markets under the name Lannett). My doctor writes the exact NDC on the scripts so there‚Äôs no mixups. 

Apparently Lannett is stopping production of their montelukast (I don‚Äôt yet know if this is temporary or permanent) so the 3 month script I just filled may be my last. 

I can‚Äôt find any manufacturers who don‚Äôt use lactose. I don‚Äôt know if any exist any more. 

Has anyone been in a similar position where they had to quit montelukast for some reason even though it works well? Seems like all the alternatives are the same meds I‚Äôm already taking but I‚Äôm out of the loop (the blissful ignorance of controlled asthma, after 3 decades of uncontrolled asthma!), and wondered if there‚Äôs anything else out there. 

Not really interested in biologics at this time, but not opposed to hearing more, either. 

Im in the US AND don‚Äôt currently have an asthma doc, due to moving a lot, insufficient income, covid making it harder to join a new doctors office, and medical-PTSD making it hard to access care. Not looking for medical advice, just hoping for relevant experiences and how you overcame them. 

Thanks a ton for any info."
I am moving from the mountains in Western NC to the middle of North Carolina.  I haven‚Äôt made a climate changing move sense before I was on a preventative inhaler and was worried about what I may be in for. I had Covid in August and sense then my asthma has been a little more exacerbated so that is something I am trying to take into account as well.
"I've had both doses of AZ weeks ago, he's had one dose of Pfizer just over a week ago. He's displaying the cough symptom and a sniffly nose so he's ordering a test. He's staying in a separate room. But now we're both panicking (although I'm hiding it). He's terrified he's going to give me covid and I'll die. I have severe allergic asthma (that requires xolair), I have Chronic fatigue/ME, and Topic Steroid Withdrawal Syndrome too so my immune system is permanently screaming out. I'm pretty confident I'll be fine, and interestingly now he's asleep he's stopped coughing. Anyone else been in this situation?"
"**TLDR: Breathed in Kratom, Chest tighened, asthma inflamed**

&amp;#x200B;

*First tried Kratom a month ago and used 3 times a week since.*

*Each time i was mixing with water prior to downing it, with no problems, the taste and dryness of it doesnt really affect me*

However, **i tried the toss and wash method thinking it would just as easy if not easier......i ended up breathing in some kratom and choking for a full 10 minutes.**

I suffer from Asthma and have since had:

*  Tight chest
* symptoms of respiratory depression i
* increased mucus production

*My Oxygen Saturation levels are fine however. It has been 6 days and i feel slight improvement in my symptoms although have upped my use of inhalers.*

I thought there would be many anecdotes online about people who have accidentally breathed in since toss and wash seems to be a top intake method.

**Anyone done this before and have you recovered?**      asthmatics/non-asthmatics?

&amp;#x200B;

My google research has taken me down a worm hole of permanent alveoli damage, emphysema and COPD, also how lungs can repair to an extent... im literally only 22 but my lung health has always been looming behind me like a grim reaper. Maybe im paranoid.

BTW Kratom all in all has been great for my mental health and have been taking at low doses for this effect and before this (succesfully consuming it) it has not had any negative impact on me or my breathing."
"Does anyone or did you have such trouble breathing that you couldn't do simple things like carry a laundry basket or go food shopping?  For five years, my lifestyle is completely sedentary.  I used to be a runner.  I've had so many scans and tests. Yes, I have some damage to my lungs, but minimal.  Nothing to explain why I am so out of breath all of the time. My doc says my pft shows mild asthma and that ""out of breath""  is very subjective.  I've taken every medication I can take, had sooooo many tests.  Do I have to spend the rest of my life like this?  I ruined my husband's Fathers Day because I can't tie a rope to cleat to take the boat out.  I'm only 53.  I'm grateful to be here.  Old age is a privilege denied to many.  But, I just can't take it.  I have a desk job luckily, so I can work.  But I can't do anything that requires any physical exertion.  Last night the coughing was so uncontrollable.  But my pulse ox was OK, my peak flow was OK, I took every antihistamine and cough syrup I could find.  Used the nebulizer.  There was nothing else I could do at home.  The only thing that got me through finally was a sleeping pill, because I couldn't fall asleep on my own (btw the Islanders game was great!)I think I am just looking for someone who understands.  I spend a lot of my time masking how I feel, because I don't want to draw attention to myself all the time. But it's exhausting.  I'm so tired.  Can anyone relate?"

I should mention; I ve done asthma and heart tests and it was fine!

"So, I‚Äôve been asthmatic since I was a little girl, I‚Äôm 31 now. About a year or two after I was born I would wheeze and cough and my doctors determined it was asthma. I know I had to do tests when I was younger because I had used a nebulizer for years and once it became more manageable we switched to an inhaler. 

My one doctor tried to put on me on Advair when I was in middle school but I had a horrible reaction and stayed on the inhaler only. And this has worked out well for me since then. I only need my inhaler for allergy season, the cold weather (because I can get a cold that‚Äôll turn into bronchitis real quick), and before a hard workout - so I‚Äôm not using it daily. 

I recently got a new PCP and while she was taking my history she asked about my asthma. And I felt like she didn‚Äôt believe me that I was asthmatic because she wants me to get a PFT done. She said it‚Äôs to determine how my asthma is now and whether or not I need the inhaler I‚Äôve been using (which is albuterol). I feel a little uneasy about this because it‚Äôs not like I use my inhaler every day but I will still have moments when I just wheeze. 

Has anyone else had to do a PFT even after they‚Äôve been managing their asthma for years? Would just like some advice. 

Thank you!"
"Hello!

So since around 2 year i hace been diagnosed with astmha accoarding to my lung dr, i had some diffrent medicine and stuck with foster atm, 4 times a day.

Now i have always smoked my whole life since i was like 17 till 27 (stoped 2 years ago) and also smoked weed between 17 and 21

But i never had any issues with breathing or anything with what im experiencing now, 

According to the lung dr they say it just looks fine how it is now, but i still have moments where it feels like im having a hard time breathing, fast breathing, and a weird feeling i cant put in words. Like everything is rushed, feels like i dont get enough air, and cant inhale deep enough,  its really scary at times. 

And again, theres probably more but i dont remember at times how i felt at that moment, 20 minutes ago i felt really bad with breathing again that i used ventolin and now it feels a bit better tho, feels like if i move my leg fast it helps breathing aswell?

So idk, guess my question is, do you all know this feeling? Is this astmha? Is there anything i can do? Is it relateble with anyone else?


You can dm me, would apperciate every answer!

And thanks for reading!"
"Just prescribed Forstair, 200x2 twice a day &amp; I shake quite a bit after taking it. Is this normal and will the shaking stop after a few days? I‚Äôve taken it for two days so far"
"Im sharing this because I've really been researching with no luck for a natural alternative to albuterol/daily meds and after many years I found what works for me. I've had asthma since I was 5 and I'm 29 now. It has ways been worse when I'm sick and during allergy season and I'll always keep a back up albuterol forthose times. Whats been working for me the past 2-3 months with no albuterol is that I have been drinking a daily herbal infusion of nettle, oat straw, and red Clover and found it helped with allergy symptoms greatly, including breathing. What really works though is lobelia tincture. It is a low dose herb and can make you vomit if you take too much but whenever I feel symptoms coming on I put a quarter of a dropper under my tongue and hold it for a 2 full deep breaths then sip water slowly and I don't need to reach for the albuterol. I can feel it work almost instantly the same way my rescue inhaler works but better. These herbs have changed my life and hopefully can bring some natural healing to others. Let me know if you have questions or would like to share stories of herbs working or not working for you"
"I am currently like 19, but I was wondering, did your asthma (to all the older people out there) treatment get more heavy as you got older? Does your body eventually become resistant to steroid medication?"
"After using my albuterol rescue inhaler &amp; nebulizer I tend to get cramps in my feet, and Charlie horses in the middle of the night. Any recommendations for how to prevent, prepare, or help alleviate them? TYIA!"
Why does asthma always get worse in the evening and on weekends? It‚Äôs never a Monday morning.
"Has anyone dealt with their daily steroid inhaler causing really bad acne? I'm in school to be an esthetician and learned about it and then coincidentally got diagnosed and have had really bad asthma problems. (always had minor acne) ever since being through 2 round of steroids &amp; now a daily steroid inhaler my acne is BAD and so painful. 

I've seen that potentially no topical treatments help... Any chance anyone here has had this sort of issue? I'm at a lost and it's just been so uncomfortable and damaging to my self esteem."
"Life long asthmatic here. I've had ups and downs with chronic asthma over the 32 years of my living. Been moreso in control over the last 10 years until this spring season. To the point where I've had my doc put me on a round of Prednisone and a prescription for singular. I haven't owned a nebulizer since I was a kid but I'm looking into getting one. 

Should I wait for my doctor to prescribe me one or should I buy one online? For the former, would a nebulizer that my doc orders be a higher end (covered my insurance of course)? Or would I be purchasing the same type from Amazon? 

Any and all tips for my problem are welcome!"
"Hello, my name is Olivia and I‚Äôm a senior at San Diego State University.

I believe there‚Äôs a way to improve the quality of life for parents and their children with chronic disease. My colleague and I have been interviewing parents and their children in an effort to better understand how they manage chronic disease (e.g. asthma, diabetes, epilepsy) on a daily basis. Our ultimate goal is to develop a solution that helps families like yours.

I would love to speak with anyone who identifies with themselves as part of that group to learn more about your experience. It will only take about 15-20 minutes.

"Hey guys! So I‚Äôm very new to the asthma game, 23 years old. All I have is a rescue inhaler. I can only really take deep breaths. I can barely sleep and I wake up with horrible back pain and dizziness all day. Do I need prevention medicine? I can‚Äôt think of the last time I had a normal day without trouble. Thanks y‚Äôall!"
"Here's the backstory:
I was diagnosed with allergic bronchial asthma within a year after birth. When I think of my childhood the first image that comes to my mind is being sick. I have not done any detailed allergy test but I have observed I am allergic to dust, food that is too sweet, sour, or spicy, milk and milk products, aerosol &amp; perfumes &amp; cold drinks.I can't speak to anyone for days

Whenever my allergy triggers my throat swells alot and feels like there is a cactus in there with constant mucus. In later stages it evolves to heavy coughing.
I have rarely had shortness of breath but burning sensation in throat is almost unbearable with the weakness.
 
Life has been a bit better since I started taking constant medicines I take montelukast tab. and flomist nasal spray regularly since past 4-5 years but recently it seems like my body is too much used to that medicine and it doesn't affect much.

Whenever the symptoms arise I start taking my inhaler as well (foracort 200) &amp; some other medicines.

Right now I am sick again despite having taking medications regularly. Even having consulted with best doctors in the country the maximum they do is change the medicine or the inhaler.

This is affecting my professional life so that's why I am writing this to ask if anyone else is going through this and how do you deal with it and make life better."

Has anyone tried using a breathing trainer/altitude mask? Do they work? They're products that are supposed to restrict your breathing so that you breathe more efficiently without them.
Started getting dry mouth and eyes a couple months after starting Xolair. Not sure if it's related. Anyone experienced drying effects from Xolair?

"Curious if anyone has seeked alternative natural medicines for treating asthma? Of course vaping/smoking is out of the question, but oils and edibles could can be ingested safely. Any studies done?"

"Hi!  
Okay so the past few days I've been struggling with terrible asthma symptoms. I went to see an allergist/ENT and they weren't doing breathing tests due to Covid but they scheduled me one for July 20th. She gave me Asmanex inhaler, a nose spray for allergies, and abuterol for rescue inhaler. She didn't say if it was asthma or not but on the appointment summary papers it says mild asthma so I'm confused.

Anyone deal with this?  
Also, how is Asmanex? all of this is so new to me"
"Hi Everyone,

New allergic asthmatic here. I am currently trying to find a solution. I wanted to see if anyone else has this problem and was there something you did to resolve it. 

I normally have high pressure in my eyes and I was recently prescribed Symbicort. I took it for like 4 days and it gave me eye pain. My dr changed my inhaler to Breo which also gives me eye issues.  Looking at the side effects it says it can increase your eye pressure. 

Has anyone run across this problem? If so what did you do?

Thanks"

[Asthma](https://www.millioninsights.com/industry-reports/asthma-market?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sunilR_17June21) is a lung disease; i.e. a chronic condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the bronchial tube (the passageways that permit air to pass in and leave the lungs). Some of the symptoms of asthma include shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing and chest tightness. The factors that propel the Asthma Market size include innovation in drugs, rising occurrences of asthma cases, mounting geriatric population, rising number of smokers, growth in the disposable income, developing healthcare infrastructure and facilities, and intensifying pollution level.

On the other hand, there are also factors that hinder the global Asthma Market size such as the patent expiry of drugs, high expenditure on treatment, and growth in use of generic drugs. The global Asthma Market size spans type, device type, drug type, route of administration, and geography. On the basis of type, the global Asthma Market size constitutes allergic asthma and non-allergic asthma. The allergic asthma is basically caused due to exposure to allergens like pollens from weeds, trees, etc., dust, and so on. On the other hand, the non-allergic asthma is basically caused due to exercise, stress, cold, flu, etc.

On the basis of device type, the global Asthma Market size constitutes inhalers and nebulizers. The ‚Äúinhalers‚Äù segment is further sub-categorized as dry powder, soft mist inhalers (SMIs), metered dose inhalers (MDIs). Nebulizers are devices that carry the drug in a fluid form that is dispensed by the compressed air. The ‚Äúnebulizers‚Äù segment is further sub-categorized as mesh nebulizers, compressor nebulizers, and ultrasonic nebulizers. In 2015, the metered dose inhalers (MDIs) accounted for the largest share of the global Asthma Market owing to the ease of availability, consistency, portability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.

The features like portability, noteworthy benefits in the home healthcare applications, and ideal design that enables dispense medication directly to the respiratory track are estimated to offer prospective growth opportunities for its high utility.¬† On the basis of drug type, the global Asthma Market size spans anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, bronchodilators, mast cell stabilizers, leukotriene antagonists, and combination of ICS/LABA. In this segmentation, the combination drug type consisting of inhaled corticosteroids with long-acting beta agonists dominated the global Asthma Market in 2015. The factors that attribute to the large share of combination drug type are rise in application rates due to twofold action of combination therapy and its high efficacy rate.

On the basis of route of administration, the global Asthma Market size spans inhaled, oral, intravenous, and subcutaneous. The inhaled route of administration accounted for the largest market share of the Asthma Market in 2015.¬† On the basis of geography, the global Asthma Market size constitutes North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Rest of the World. North America holds the largest share of the global Asthma Market due to rising number of asthma patients, increase in geriatric population, drug innovation, high-tech advancement, and developed healthcare infrastructure. The North American market is tracked by Europe. During the forecast period, the Asia Pacific‚Äôs market is projected to witness a high growth rate owing to factors such as rise in population, increasing number of asthma patients, emerging healthcare infrastructure and facilities, environmental pollution, growing disposable income, and enlarging number of smokers.

Some of the prominent players that fuel the growth of the Asthma Market include AstraZeneca Plc, Philips Healthcare, 3M Health Care, Allied Healthcare Products Inc., Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Novartis AG, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., GF Healthcare Products, Smith Medicals, Lincare Holdings Inc., and Baxter International."
ASTHMA COMMUNITY UNITE! I need major help my 17M brother is starting to look at colleges and really thinking about Brown University. I told him to consider that his asthma may worsen over there since Ik the east coast and south are not very good places for asthma patients especially since we live in the Bay Area and have decent air over here most of the time. Does anyone know how Rhode Island is when it comes to asthma or have any stories revolving their asthma and Rhode Island or any surrounding states? This would be a big help in helping him decide what other schools he wants to apply too! Thank you all in advance. Anything helps!
"I used to be a singer. Nothing too fancy but I did choir in high school, made honor choir even, and I grew up in a very musical family. I always wanted to get voice lessons and learn to sing opera. Flovent HFA has been great for treatment of my asthma symptoms but it's stolen my voice from me. I can still talk and I can sing in a low register but parts of my vocal range, especially the upper range, are just missing entirely. I sound like a smoker as well, I have a constant rasp in my voice. I've read some articles about this that basically say the only fix is to stop the steroid. I'd rather not do that because I enjoy breathing so I wanted to know if anyone has had the same side effect and gotten relief by switching to a different inhaled corticosteroid. If so, what did you switch to?"
"Curious if anyone else got their asthma diagnosis later in life. I was diagnosed about 2 years ago when I was 29 after having a chronic cough, post nasal drip, and eventually difficulty breathing. Symbicort helps a lot and I have to use a rescue inhaler  occasionally. I *think* the asthma was brought on by my pretty significant sinus issues and I‚Äôm not totally convinced that I actually have asthma? Anyway, I suppose I‚Äôm just curious if anyone else has a similar story or if you believe you had a true asthma diagnosis later in life."
"I have my evaluation on Monday to see if I have asthma. I highly suspect as I do as we‚Äôre dealing with some terrible wildfires in my area that have been causing me shortness of breath. When I went to urgent care they could hear the wheeze in my lungs. I had an inhaler as a kid though no one can seem to remember if I had a true diagnosis.

What kind of tests might the doctor perform during my evaluation? 

Also, I‚Äôve been tracking my peak flow at home with an OTC meter as suggested by a friend. My numbers have ranged from 250-450. Is there anything else I could do that might give the docs some information about what I‚Äôm dealing with?"
"I sometimes get this sore pain under my right ribs, and it sort of feels like a balloon is there. It‚Äôs annoying because I have to sit perfectly straight or else it hurts. If I slouch even a little bit it feels like I‚Äôm crushing my rib. Anyone else experience this?"
"Hi,
So is started budesonide in a nebulizer on Monday and used it again yesterday. I was fine all day today, but I started feeling weak, nauseous, &amp; my head hurt. Is this because of the budesonide? Has anyone had similar side effects?"
Since a really bad attack I‚Äôve had daily chest pains that never really went away for 2 months now. Some days it‚Äôs barely noticeable but still there and other days it‚Äôs persistent the whole day.
"And it's going to be amazing.
It changes my life.
Anyone else take it occasionally when you very very sick ? 
Been on my nebulizer 3 times a day for the last 3 days
I really needed something stronger.
Mask mandate ends, and day 1, 50 viruses decide to jump into my body !"
"This started just today, when I went to take my rescue inhaler. Every time I've taken the inhaler, I start to get really faint and dizzy with a little bit of tunnel vision. Kind of like when you stand up too fast, but worse. 

This is a problem because it's been acting up the last few days with the recent hot temps (socal) and I'm back to sleeping like crap, being exhausted, chest tightness, cough.

Is this an asthma attack? And what do I do? The rescue inhaler helped me breath easier now, but I'm just really foggy now and I kind of don't want to take it again."
"I've recently been looking into ways to maintain my asthma along side Flovent. I ran into lignosus, however I cant really find reviews on it. Have any of you guys tried it? If so, what was you experience?"

"I've been struggling with anxiety, depression etc almost all my adult life. I also occasionally get breathing difficulties. It's exacerbated massively by allergies. I went to my previous GP surgery (UK) maybe 3 or 4 times. Refused to test me. Gave me a reliever inhaler when I begged for one saying I really couldn't breathe properly.

Moved house. New doctors surgery. Same complaint. Tested. Diagnosed. Have a preventer. My life has improved tenfold. I sleep properly. Nerves are gone. Don't feel in despair or life I won't make it though life anymore. I CAN BREATHE.

Had no idea the root cause was an underlying health issue. Clearly neither did the doctors. I wish I could inflict misery on the last ones but honestly I'm just so grateful to the new surgery for finally fixing my life with something so simple.

Just needed to get it off my chest. Thanks."
"Hi all, just as the headline states! I'm a 32m, and I'm in good shape, eat healthily, alot of protein and veg, low carb. I keep fit and play sport. Asthma hasnt really bothered me until the last week or two. Mornings are tough when I wake up and I'm out of bed, and I get an urge to go to the toilet and once I've made a movement, my stomach feels empty and the pressure goes. A few things of note, I got diagnosed with HPylori a few months back, took the course of meds and waiting on a re-test. One other thing, asthma is very unsettled today, and I notice that the next day its very bad after eating cheese the day before. Any thoughts or inputs would help. I get very anxious about it all as I dont know whats suddenly changed. Thanks."
"I got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine yesterday, and at night I experienced mild shortness of breath. I took my Buventol which might have helped a little bit, but this morning I still have really mild feeling of pressure in my chest and difficulties to breath deeply.

It‚Äôs weird, because my asthma has been well under control lately but now, after I got the vaccine, these symptoms have appeared. Of  course I‚Äôm also worried about pulmonary embolism even though this vaccine shouldn‚Äôt cause it. Or maybe this all is just coincidence? 

Has anyone had similar experiences after covid vaccine?"
"So when I workout lately I cough brown mucus or sometimes bright pink. 

But I have been coughing it up for around 8 months now. It went away about 2 months ago and I notice it comes back when I work out. 

I have asthma and take nothing for it because it was just something that affected me when I was a kid.

I have had multiple tests ie CT scan of my Sinus, Brain MRI, Back MRI, Ultrasound of Abdomen, x2 X-ray of lungs, EMG, EKG, blood tests. All came back as ok.

Idk what is causing this asthma is my best guess as my evidence is the most evidence I have for something causing it. (Don‚Äôt smoke)"
I just constantly clear my throat
"Ok so little back story I had severe asthma as a child. Very bad to the point that I would get hospitalized. Luckily I outgrew it but I have a feeling that it‚Äôs back. About 2 months ago I started having symptoms of a cold, I didn‚Äôt think much of it (btw it can‚Äôt be covid related since I get tested quite frequently). Anyways- shortly after I started wheezing. It‚Äôs a really loud whistle type of noise and it gets bad only at night. I find it hard to sleep sometimes due to the fact that it‚Äôs so loud. I told my doctor about a month ago and she told me to take allergy medication but I don‚Äôt really like any type of medication. It‚Äôs been weeks and I still wheeze every single night. Has this happened to anyone else? Is it a normal symptom of seasonal allergies? Should I go to the doctor? Please let me know"

"Cold winter air really bothers me, while the hot humid summer feels like I can leave my medicine behind. 

How many of you made physical moves to other states/regions for better control of your asthma?

I was always told hot and dry like Arizona would be ideal but I've never experienced it. My asthma is mostly exercised/stressed induced. After a good workout I'm winded but the inhaler doesn't really help, I'm better off just breathing deep."

"hi! i'm 21 years old and get married in less than a month. 
i have always had super severe allergies. i was always ""that kid"", snotty, drooly, sneezing. 
even in my adult life i'm still very allergic. triggered mainly by like outside stuff and my cats. i take just normal zyrtec as needed but oh my gosh let me tell you what happened. 
yesterday was fine, normal. my cats have been sneezing (which is cute but sad for them, just normal cold theyre fine) and i was comforting one of them being all over them kissing them etc. 
felt my normal flare up of allergies, but then i couldn't breathe. watched the bachelorette with my fianc√©, couldn't breathe. went to bed not being able to breathe.
woke up at 3am struggling so bad i had to take a steaming hot bath 
up and down throughout the night exhausted. 

this morning i bite the bullet &amp; do a tele health appointment.  the guy was a creep but just said it's bad allergies and prescribed me singulair which i wish i knew the effects of before taking and most likely won't take again. i went to the urgent care because i have bad anxiety as well and mainly wanted peace of mind but also was scared. 

doctor was lovely said my lungs were fine, heart was fine, blood pressure etc. 
i didn't bring up asthma simply because it hadn't crossed my mind. i always assumed it was diagnosed as a baby. 

well here i am. realizing it makes perfect sense that this COULD be asthma. but idek where to begin. how do i get tested? can it be done virtually?"
"hi! so i have very bad allergies and for the first time experienced what i think was an asthma flare up. 

i talked to a doctor via tele health and he prescribed me singulair. i just took 1 and then went to look it up to see what everyone said and i saw the huge issue with it leading to depression/suicidal thoughts and causing issues. 
i'm quite scared. i've only taken it once, just now, but i don't want this to happen to me as i'm already a pretty anxious thinker. 

do you think this could occur with just one dose? i probably won't be continuing taking it after this. i'm scared shitless rn because i don't want to get sent into a depressive episode"

"Hi all, I've been dealing with pretty serious adult onset asthma for a few months now. After my first PCP appointment I was prescribed an albuterol rescue inhaler and twice-a-day 250/50 Advair. Unfortunately the rescue inhaler does nothing at all to relieve my symptoms and I have noticed no difference in my condition on Advair either. My doctor then gave me a 5 day course of 40 mg prednisone and the only thing I felt on that was insomnia, didn't notice any difference in my breathing condition. I now have an appointment with a pulmonologist next month so hopefully they can help me, but I'm starting to get scared?? Thankfully my attacks haven't been bad enough to prompt any ER visits but it's scary to know that steroids haven't even helped me one bit.

Did anyone go through something similar with their asthma experience? I see a lot of posts on here about people finding their 'miracle meds' and it gives me hope because this condition is awful and nothing has helped me. I'm 23 and asthma has flipped my life upside down overnight. It's tough to focus at work, I can't do anything active, I can't even hang out with friends for long before I have to just retreat home and chill my chest out. Hoping I can find a way to get this under control :("
"It's been an interesting couple of days in the world of my asthma. Sunday I was up in Maine, we were going to work on a piece of property up there. We stop at a local hardware store to get some tools. Well, right as I hop out of the car and walk in front of it, I notice a worker smoking a cigarette *right there*. Cigarette smoke specifically is my biggest asthma trigger; it messes me up for literally days. So, as my family goes in and gets what we need to get, there I am sitting on the back of the car, taking my inhaler, drinking water, chewing on mint gum (helps for some reason), coughing up a lung as everyone is staring at me. Nothing to see here folks, just dying at the hands of this random lady who works for this random local hardware store.

Anyways. We went home Sunday night as scheduled, I continued to die. Yesterday, Monday, I went to school. In the morning I'd been... better, kinda. Not coughing nearly as much. Most people around me in school realize I have asthma and are used to me coughing some, just not this much. Because I was feeling better, I actually tried while we were playing baseball in second period, gym class. I must say, being someone not terribly athletic I did better than I ever usually do, and I was really trying and very proud of myself. Well, sprinting to a home run while having messed up asthma was not a terrific idea, as I soon learned. Third period, history, I'm sitting there and just can't stop coughing. The main issue being that none of my coughs are substantial, like you know how you get a good cough where you can feel yourself clearing up a little, this was not that. Eventually, I ask to go to the nurse, no explanation needed because at this point everyone has figured out that ""hey that kid in the back corner is freaking dying"". Go to the nurse, they don't have my inhaler. See, I realized this, but typically I don't need to use my inhaler so I've never bothered to give one to the nurse since this is my first year at this school and I haven't needed it. Well, yesterday I learned I actually am allowed to self-medicate. Would have been nice to know while I was packing my bag at home, inhaler right there. So anyways, nurse's assistant knows I have asthma, I'm able to get enough words in to express that I encountered smoke and was pretty much just messed up from that. No other symptoms of covid, and she confirmed that. Then the actual nurse comes in. She starts just going off about ""why did you come to school today,"" ""you don't know it isn't covid,"" ""then why do you have that bad of a cough."" She's being pretty loud and just talking over me while I'm trying to explain that **yeah lady I walked through cigarette smoke and promptly forgot how to breathe, this is a routine thing that has always happened to me even before covid**. But, of course, this is between coughs, voice is mildly dead, so I can't talk loud, so she just ignores me. Eventually I finally get through to her, then they just stick me in a bed in the very back and ignore me for a half hour while my parents come to get me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, some main takeaways from my story:

1. Make sure nobody's smoking when I get out of the car
2. Maybe don't sprint for the home run while having issues with asthma
3. Bring my inhaler places
4. Don't bother wasting my ever-fleeting breath to explain things to the school nurse because she doesn't listen.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Walked through cigarette smoke, asthma attack, went to school next day, sprinted in PE class, died more, went to nurse, nurse didn't half care, didn't bring my inhaler, went home early, asthma sucks.**"
"Last February my asthma was very poorly maintained I was having pretty bad attacks and using my nebulizer all the time I didn't have any preventive care inhalers at all because I couldn't afford them. 

Then I got really sick, my friend drove me to the hospital I had a hundred and five degree fever and after all the tests were said and done I had pneumonia and the flu. I ended up in the hospital for one week even with insurance the bill was $25,000.

Today my asthma is very well maintained so I never have to go through an experience like that again. 

Also sadly my step dad's best friend died of an asthma attack on some hiking expedition in the middle of the desert. Which is why as much as I love living in Arizona I don't venture too far into the desert on hiking Adventures very often and if I do I make sure I have plenty of Medicine with me."
Went to bed early after a workout and then woke up with a really bad panic attack at like 12:30am probably triggered by too much inhaler use and then a asthma attack at 3am! The asthma attack started in a dream where I was struggling to breath then woke up struggling to breath took prednisone and working from home today. Been a while since a bad attack my asthma is pretty well maintained these days!
"I popped a 3rd bronchaid pill since its still not quite shutting down the attack. I have a really big tolerance to this stuff from constant use (running through an entire box in 15 days). Caffeine is starting to take gradual effect. Right now i feel very overstimulated. I am mentally very, very tired and wish i could rest but i cannot lie down and close my eyes for even 15 seconds without having this sensation that i‚Äôm falling into an endless pit and my entire body reflexively twitches out of it. Its gonna be a very rough day today. Starting to sweat a lot, even with the fan on and it being generally cool inside the room. Mental fog is kind of starting to take shape. I‚Äôll see how it goes in an hr or so."
"i think i‚Äôm addicted to my albuterol, i take it whenever i get any discomfort with my breathing. i don‚Äôt know how to stop taking it because if i don‚Äôt take the albuterol i‚Äôll breath like i‚Äôm breathing out of a straw for the next 3 hours until my alternative medicine kicks in. i‚Äôm afraid to tell my parents that my inhaler runs out because it runs out so fast so i always end up not having one for a few weeks and not having one causes me really bad anxiety. i don‚Äôt know what to do"
"I love comedy. I love to laugh. I do not like asthma attacks, and the worst asthma attacks i get are from laughing at what i believe are really funny things. I don‚Äôt even get half as bad asthma attacks from smoking or exercising. I‚Äôm gonna write this off on my list of reasons titled : Why life is not worth living. Also - I am currently writing this as i try to calm down and hope that my body doesn‚Äôt choke me to death while I patiently wait for my 50mg of ephedrine sulfate to kick in because i am still awaiting medicaid approval and do not have an inhaler."
"Hi! I have very mild asthma. Yesterday I was cycling for a half an hour while it was mildly windy (I was well clothed) and in the evening I drank ice tea that was a bit too cold. Today I feel like I caught a very mild cold, but it mostly feels just like a pressure in lungs/breathing a bit harder. So I probably didn't catch a cold, it's just asthma that got a little bit worse, but I still wanted to ask. I don't have fever or anything.

Tomorrow I get vaccinated. Could that ""cold/asthma"" be a problem? Should you be completely healthy when you get vaccinated?"

"So, I‚Äôve had asthma since I was 3. Had to have a breathing treat meant every 4 hours of my life for years. This year (I‚Äôm 25) we had our annual family reunion camping trip. Normally I NEVER notice a difference in my asthma. But this year. I did. My fathers camp site he chooses is always at the bottom of a steep hill. At the top of that hill is the bathroom. Every year I can‚Äôt walk up it so I would have to drive the measly 5 campsite away to even go pee. (sorry if it‚Äôs tmi) well this year! I was able to walk up and down the hill in 90 degree (F) weather just fine. I mean, slight heavy breathing but who wouldn‚Äôt when it‚Äôs that hot, in direct sunlight and straight up hill? I‚Äôve been on two new asthma medications for the past year and I don‚Äôt know if I have a good weekend, if it was a fluke or if the medications are helping but it made me feel so good that I could do it!"
"I take Asmanex HFA (100 mcg), 2 puffs each day at night before bed. My asthma is well managed, never need rescue inhaler as long as I stick to this routine."
"I went to the ER on Thursday night (first time), was given a nebulizer treatment and 60mg of oral prednisone, and had a good response (except that whole not sleeping a wink that night thing, lol.) I left with an RX for 5 days of prednisone (40mg/day) and I still feel crummy. My chest is super tight and heavy, I‚Äôm coughing a lot, I‚Äôm utterly exhausted. Is this normal? Should I be worried what‚Äôs going to happen when I‚Äôm done on the prednisone? I have a message into my pulmonologist about this, but curious about real-world examples, too. 

Background: dx with adult onset asthma at the start of pandemic, so this is all still kind of new. I take singular (10mg), Advair (250, twice a day), and Qvar 3-4 times a day during flare ups like this."
"hahahah, i have to go to the ER in an hour because i currently have 0% control over my asthma ü§™"

"Hello everyone, I take advair 230/21 4 puffs a day, and have been doing so since February 2021. Although it's helped control my asthma, I've been noticing some bad side effects from it such as muscle weakness here &amp; there along with changes in my voice (my voice has become super raspy and cracky). Today, someone sent me a video of me talking a year ago, and my voice was SO different - clear, controlled and healthy. Definitely not what I sound like today. I also noticed my face was MUCH skinnier. As in, not a lot of bloating!!!  

I'm really upset. Even though it's controlling my asthma, it sucks with these side effects. Anyone have advice? Are there any other controller meds out there that won't cause these symptoms (or as much)? What are your experiences?"
"Im not really looking for a diagnosis as such but more wondering if my symptoms could be a sign of it and if it's worth consulting a GP about 

Im really unfit at 73kg 5""1 and very inactive around exercise 

I recently took up a jogging challenge to help me get into it and become fitter however after just 60 seconds of running I'm really out of breathe and sometimes feel sick. After the second run at 60 seconds I'm pretty much finished an entire bottle of water 

After completing 8 mins in total of running with a 90 second walk between running i get inside and look in the mirror to see my face is bright red, feels like its on fire and my cheeks and lips are slightly blue. 
It takes me a good 5 minutes just to cool down 

I've never had any symptoms and as a non smoker  always thought my lungs were really healthy 

I don't want to waste my Gps time if it's not asthma but im just wondering for those who do have asthma does this sound like it could be and i should contact my GP?"
"Hi all I wish you all doing fine. Recently I am diagnosed with the copd which lasted for 10+ years. The doctor prescribed me Flovent Diskus. I have been taking it for 3 days and I am still waiting for significant changes(since it takes few weeks to kick in). However, I feel more energized and sometimes it becomes easier to verbalize myself(I had a hard time speaking fluently for a long time). I also found my face less bloated. I have not changed my diet and my weight is constant so far. So I wanna ask do you know any relationships between COPD and bloated face/body? Thanks!"
"I have pretty mild asthma, but I'm very overweight which is why I'm on Advair 500/50. I haven't had any side effects and I notice I rarely use my Rescue. 

Anyway I work late and so I usually take my Advair around 12pm and 12am everyday. Today I forgot to take it at 12 and it's nearly 4pm. Was wondering if it was still ok to take the Advair now and take it at 12am or should I just skip the dose and wait to take it at 12am so I can ensure that each does is 12 hours apart. 

Thanks and have a nice day."
"So for about 4 months I used my abuteral inhaler everyday 3-4 times I had a ton of medical issues and recently saw a new doctor and she told me that that‚Äôs way too much so I stopped using it and I‚Äôve been extremely dizzy like I feel like I‚Äôm on a boat constantly, severe fatigue  idk if this is common or not yesterday my blood pressure got down to 105/50"

"Hello fellow asthmatics I recently started my first maintenance inhaler Flovent. How long did it take before you guys actually noticed it was helping your asthma? I'm only on day 2 and my asthma doesn't seem better I've mainly just been going through the side effects (headaches, &amp; sore throat) Thanks for the replies in advance ü§ô"
"Hi so I have asthma, I was diagnosed in January after consistent episodes of breathing difficulty and multiple chest infections in 2020. Recently I was given Soprabec steroid inhaler, to be taken 2 puffs in morning and 2 in evening, after I had an asthma attack whilst working at the bar in the pub. I'm still stumped as to what happened, one minute I'm serving whiskey to three of our regulars who were the only ones indoors, the next I'm coughing uncontrollably, my coworker said my lips were going blue (absolutely terrified her as well) and I felt like I couldn't catch the next breath - it was my first serious asthma attack and scared the absolute shit out of me. Luckily I managed to get my spacer and I was able to stop it without going to hospital, and got sent home by my boss - I got an emergency asthma appointment a few days later (as my attack was at the weekend and the GP was closed) and the asthma nurse gave me Soprabec. She warned me it could make me cough and could make me gain weight but didn't mention anything about fatigue or irritation. I've been taking it as prescribed and been doing everything I've been told since Tuesday evening when I got the inhaler but my god, I feel like my brain has been tampered with or I've been possessed by some weird spirit.

I normally work from 4:30 maybe 5 until 11 at night, 4 days a week, the pub where I work is a literal 3 min walk down the hill from my house. This week I've only worked 1 shift since starting the steroids and I was really tired during it, more than usual. I go to bed pretty much straight after I get home (11:15-11:30) because it's physically quite demanding, and I get up around 7:30-8, sometimes I take my brother to school at 8:30 (short drive). If I haven't been at work, I usually go to sleep at 10:45-11:00. However since starting the steroids I've got up in the morning, maybe done the school run, played with my cat/read a book, had lunch because I'm bloody starving, and then fallen asleep on the sofa watching Netflix because I'm so damn tired. I have my first covid vaccine tomorrow (there was an admin error so it's 8 weeks late!) and I'm kinda worried the fatigue will get even worse. The tiredness comes in waves and luckily there are points where I don't feel completely run down and exhausted but there's other times I'm sat on the sofa struggling to keep my eyes open. I'm basically dead once I've finished eating lunch around 12:30.

Has anyone else had this issue, on Soprabec or any other steroids? And if you have, was it temporary???? I feel that maybe the asthma nurse would have mentioned if I would feel like I've been run over by a train by midday. I'm sort of worried that if I'm still on steroids by September it will interfere with my university work and everything else I do when I'm at uni. I am quitting my job at the pub for multiple reasons - partly because the smoking area makes my asthma bad but also because my boss doesn't give a crap about covid rules - but am applying to work in other places and want to be able to bring my A game to the job without feeling like I'm gonna fall into a coma afterwards."

Don't get a terrible summer cold. I have been sick for 10 days and can barely breathe. Chest x-ray Monday. O2 is fine but I can't take deep breaths. My Doctor has me taking albuterol 4x/day and I feel like I am on meth. Doctor said now that masks are off almost everywhere some really bad colds are rearing their ugly heads. Be careful out there.
I‚Äôm scheduled to get my second Pfizer vaccine dose today. I‚Äôve been monitoring my lung peak flow for a couple of days now and it‚Äôs a 350 (75% of the average ) although the average person of my height and age is 450 . After my first shot I felt sick/ out of breath for two weeks. I started monitoring my lung peak flow the third week since I‚Äôm still feeling like I‚Äôm having a hard time catching my breath .  It‚Äôs not that bad though since I‚Äôm still biking for two hours a day. Should I get the shot today? (I‚Äôm hesitant about not going today since I don‚Äôt actually know what my normal for lung peak flow is and it might just not go up)

"Ok, so basically I use Asmanex HFA 100 mcg, 2 puffs daily, and it's going to run out, so I need a refill. however, my dad has asthma too, so he ordered a 200 mcg 3 inhalers of Asmanex HFA.  He tried 1 whole inhaler but it did not work. Now, my 100 mcg is about to run out, and I was wondering if I was allowed to use my dad's 200 mcg (1 puff daily), or if I had to renew my 100 mcg prescription and let it go to waste."
"I'm new here, but just wanted to see if anyone else was in the same boat. So about 3 years ago I got crazy inflammation of airways nostrils. After many tests, doctors it's not normal asthma and meds don't work on it, instead it's just the airways inflaming permanently. The biggest problem is when it hits bad I just fall asleep because it's so tight. I've definitely linked it to food and the gut. I've never had anything like this in my life and it's definitely not allergies. In fact I'd like to go down the road of sibo, bacteria etc. But doctors disagree and keep bringing up random stuff like allergies, then voice box problem, then muscle spasm, nerves in stomach etc. I've been using supplements like fish oils and tons of others, and seemed to reduce the symptoms a bit but this is literally ruining my life, relationships, work, house etc."
"1. Shake your your preventative inhaler for at least 30 seconds before you take it!
2.  Make sure you wait at least a minute between each puff!
3. Make sure you use a spacer!!!!! Lots of medicine doesn't reach your lungs when a spacer is not utilized! This is the one I learned today.
4. Make sure you clean your inhaler weekly at least! [https://youtu.be/A-o\_\_kGA9AY](https://youtu.be/A-o__kGA9AY)
5. Make sure you clean your spacer weekly too!
6. Use a spacer, I cannot stress this enough!!
7. Store your inhaler with it's cap on!
8. Store your inhaler in its little box it came in, and put that in a box too, in a closet or something, for temprature control!

"I'm 18 and currently writting this right after i ran outside for a bit and struggled to breathe for like a good 10minutes or so. 
So i think it's fair to mention that i do have severe anxiety so my doctor just told me that it's probably that...but this isn't going away, it's been happening for like 2 years now and i feel like it's becoming worse.
So every single day i have this weird thing where i just HAVE to take a deep breath or yawn to get that satisfying relief.
I've been doing that every day, every few mins for the past 2years now.
I was never the exercising type, but now every single time i try doing the simplest of things i struggle to take deep breaths, it feels like i can't.. it feels like every breath is just inches away from being ""full"" but i just can't get there, after a few minutes of me struggling to breathe in i'll eventually get there and then i'm just left with constantly having to inhale every now and then, feeling a bit dizzy and having a very strange stomach ache?
It's the worst feeling in the world and i'm terrified of it.
Any advice? Does that sound like asthma or could it just be my anxiety? What should i do about it?"
"Hi 

I am a new asthma sufferer. I have a question for those who use symbicort. 

My Dr just recently prescribed this medication. For the dosage, I forgot what he said on the phone. And he doesn‚Äôt work on Fridays. On the medication label it says use 2 puffs a day. I called the nurse to confirm and she said it‚Äôs 2 puffs in the AM. 

Do you just use it in the AM or 1 in the AM and 1 in the PM?  Just curious on what others do.

Thanks"
Like this sensation where you have a hard time breathing and you have to hold on to stuff gasping for air? It‚Äôs happened to me a few times and at complete random. Anyone else have this happen?

"Hey guys,

I'm new to the US and my blue inhaler is running low. I only need it occasionally and my asthma is well managed for the most part so wondering if there's an online doctor or ordering method? I ideally don't want to take half a day off work to find a primary care doctor, uber over for an appointment and uber back for something that I know I need. I don't have the money just now so I figured there must be an easier way? Especially when I've seen adverts for mail delivery prescription migraine pills or contraception. Hoping there is something similar but for inhalers?"

"I have allergy induced asthma, which means that occasionally it feels like my throat is swelling closed and it becomes harder to breathe. To remedy this I have a sulbutamol inhaler. I‚Äôm currently camping and there‚Äôs pollen everywhere meaning I‚Äôve had to use my  inhaler a lot more than normal. Yesterday I used it about 8 times, this afternoon I realized I should probably check the dosages and it says not to use more than 4x times a day, this scared me a bit since I‚Äôd already used it to 3x and I know the day before I overdid it. I haven‚Äôt used it in the passed 5 hours but I‚Äôm literally sat here wheezing not capable of doing anything. Would it be okay to use it one or two more times? Or should I err on the side of the caution? I plan on going to the doctor next week for some official advice but in the meantime am hoping you guys might have some advice for me. Thanks In advance."
"Hey all! 

About me: Lifetime mild-moderate asthma, had covid in March 2021 (mild, no attacks to resp. system), Pfizer vaccine &gt;2 weeks ago. Based in Toronto. I'm on Breo which I take every other day, and take 10mg Loratadine daily. 

I'm a moderate runner, try to run 2-3 times per week. I did have a 1 month hiatus after recovering from covid, and have now resumed for 3 weeks. Before my break, I was running between 5-10km comfortably, no stops. 

Now, I can't even get through a 5k with stopping multiple times. I take my inhaler before running as a preventative measure, and then end up taking it again mid-run because I start to wheeze. Even when my lungs feel 'clear', I just don't feel like I'm getting enough air. 

I know pollen levels have been astronomical this year. Anyone else feeling like this lately? Could it be covid, or the vaccine? I'm thinking of booking a Dr's appt just to see if there's anything I might be ruling out.   


Trying not to feel discouraged about running, but this is starting to get annoying!"
"Hello! I did a FeNo test and my result was 12. I was wondering if that means I don‚Äôt have asthma or have been misdiagnosed: my trigger has always been viral illness (for example if I get a cold it always turns into bronchitis or a flu always turns into mild pneumonia; despite being a healthy slim 24F I had a severe case of covid last year). 

But my FeNo test was so low, and I haven‚Äôt had a spirometry test since I was a kid. A lung xray a year ago showed mild pneumonia (from covid) and signs of moderate to severe asthma. 

I experience breathlessness and issues with sleeping bc I can‚Äôt breathe well especially on my back every day. 

But is it possible to still be asthmatic if my FeNo test was so low??"
"I‚Äôm following up with my pulmonologist today, but I would love any insight from people further on this journey. 

Last night, I had a much stronger asthma attack than I‚Äôve had, with fairly intense chest pain on one side, shortness of breath, hyperventilation bc I couldn‚Äôt breathe deep enough, etc. At the ER, they gave me nebulizer treatment and 60 mg of prednisone, which helped calm it all down to a familiar feeling of tightness. They also did a CT to rule out pulmonary embolism, which fortunately was clear. 

But looking at the report, it says ‚ÄúImpression: emphysema. No focal infiltrate or effusion.‚Äù

Obvs, I‚Äôll be digging in with my care team on this, but I‚Äôm curious to hear from you guys bc hearing other‚Äôs experiences is so helpful. Could this be a mistake??

Background: I‚Äôm 46. Smoked 1/2 pack/day from age 17-27 (sigh, if I could turn back time‚Ä¶). Dx with adult onset asthma at the start of the pandemic ‚Äî which means I haven‚Äôt had PFT done. My mom was a long time smoker, had COPD but is doing well. My brother is a smoker who has frequent pneumonia. I do not have the Alpha-1 condition."

"i have asthma and recently i started my dream job which was working in laboratory. but the fumes of chemicals and fumes that comes after sterilizing filtering equipment really made my asthma worse in a month and i had to increase my inhaler dose. i would like to hear some opinion from asthmatic people working in lab. is it same for you? if not, what kind of lab you work at? any suggestion? do i have to give up my dream of working in lab? please help. thank you."

I‚Äôm an asthma newb. Will the albuterol help with the crazy coughing fits or is it just for when I can‚Äôt breathe well?
"I plan on emailing my doctor later this afternoon but I am coming to a realization as an adult (29F) and would really like to see if anyone can relate.

I started smoking cigarettes when I was 12, I finally quit when I was 27. I smoked probably 2-10 cigarettes a day for most of that time. For the past few years I have had a persistent cough, it happens virtually every morning. I wake up and start coughing violently to the point I can't breathe. Nothing comes up, it doesn't really hurt, and it stops after about a minute. Sometimes it can happen during the day but it seems pretty random and it's hard for me to pinpoint a trigger. I honestly just accepted this and when I do it in front of others they ask if I'm okay because it's so violent. I try to breathe in but every time I do I cough harder and harder until there's no air in my lungs. But then it's over and I'm fine.


I am also an avid hiker. I have been doing it for years. This summer I plan on starting my mission to become a 46er in NY (hiking the 46 tallest mountains in NY state). I hike frequently and typically have no issues, but if I exert myself (especially up a steep incline) to a point where I have to breathe harder, I start to become unable to catch my breath. I have to stop and take a break while I try to catch my breath. My boyfriend tells me to breathe deeper, slower breaths through my nose and it makes me really frustrated because I literally can't breathe slower or deeper in that moment. I don't feel physically tired during these times either, I just feel like I am not getting enough oxygen. I have gotten dizzy during these episodes as well. I always thought this was due to me being out of shape but I exercise pretty often, walking at least a mile a day, on my feet all day at work, I do yoga, and other outdoor activities as well. 

It feels like I have tiny lungs that can't support my body when it needs a lot of oxygen really fast. I joke with my boyfriend that I have ""baby lungs"" due to smoking so young. I feel like my ability to breathe deeply is below average for someone my age.

This whole thing is really embarrassing and frustrating because I feel like I can hike for 10+ miles easily without getting physically tired. But if I have to start breathing through my mouth during a harder portion of trail my lungs won't cooperate and hinder me from doing what I am physically capable of doing."
"I just don't know if I'm using it correctly? It may sound dumb, but I really don't know. I've watched videos and read instructions, but I just can't seem to feel anything when I try. Is it a significant feeling when the dose is taken correctly? Like would I definitely know? If it is a very subtle feeling, I don't want to keep trying in case I have been doing it correctly along and taking too many doses."
"I've been diagnosed with asthma lately, on top of or instead of mast cell disorder? The doctor didn't clarify and kind of stranded me saying take all your meds prescribed by all the random MDs I see who do not communicate. 

I didn't do poorly on my PFT and no additional tests were done. I thought there'd be follow up testing, but I guess there basing off my ER history which was previously stated severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid. It was during a referral to transitional medicine because I go to the ER more than one would like in shitty condition (difficulty breathing/air hunger, tachycardia, generalized itching, blood pressure fluctuations, shakes/chills with low grade fevers, severe pain at times, it's the shits). Anyway - I do my best on antihistamines (strong unusual doses), Montelukast, and now Advair. Pulmicort was working well and then 2 months later my lungs started burning again, I was getting shortness of breath with less effort, and my chest was aching.

So advair is doing me well a week in - all of sudden I'm doing my own groceries and lifting my laundry again. I haven't done this since January my lungs have been so shit and I was in pain  through all my joints. I thought I was dying. I can't run yet or be my normal level of active but daily functioning is nice. I just don't get how I'm supposed to manage an asthma diagnosis like this? 

I'm in a rural region of Canada with very few doctors, there's 20,000 people on our wait list. I got wait listed 6 years ago when my doctor retired and I'm connected with Healthcare connect Ontario. I can't work until I'm not sick every day like this, I'm a nurse and need to walk 12 hrs a day. I also need to roll and bend and lift, I can't like this. 

I'm so lost."
"We buy insurance off the US healthcare marketplace, which will cover 100% of the procedure cost.  How do you handle asthma if you do not have insurance?"
"I've had mostly exercise-induced asthma since childhood. (Currently i am 24, f)

I managed well with just occasionally using Albuterol. Using a daily inhaler didn't seem to make a difference so i never kept up.

The past few months it has been a different beast entirely. It seems to be anxiety-induced although physical activity can escalate the attacks because my body is more out of control

It often starts as an intense, sharp cough, then my throat closes up quickly. The more i worry about it the worse it gets. The more i worry about anything actually It is often so hard to breathe that it feels like my skull is going to explode.

 Albuterol doesn't help. I tried to use a daily inhaler for a week or so and didn't see a difference (asmanex)

I have considered covid but i was tested twice with negative results.

I was hospitalized yesterday because it got so bad. Honestly the doctors didn't discuss much with me because it was the er, just asked me basic questions, ran basic tests, got me stabilized and sent me home with a steroid prescription.

I'm wondering if anyone has experienced a sharp increase in symptoms, especially like mine--comorbid with anxiety, coughing, is rather sudden, and Albuterol doesn't do shit for it--is it treatable? I'm kinda worried i won't find a medication that will help."
"Hey! Yesterday i was enjoying a cheese sandwich and because of my asthma felt the needle to take a deep breath, stupidly not taking mind of the fact I was eating. I breathed in a bit of the sandwich and ended up coughing out a small piece of lettuce 3 minutes later. I was really anxious that I inhaled the bread and ended up forcing myself to cough hard for a few minutes (while I genuinely felt a need to cough it was mainly forced coughing, not inadvertent-it certainly wasn't uncontrollable coughing). For the past day I've felt shorter of breath than usual and have had a light, intermittent cough, something I don't usually have. Do not have a wheeze. 

I wonder if anyone else has this problem about inhaling food due to gasping while eating. For me it's one of the most annoying things to remember not to do because of asthma. 

Does anyone think I likely inhaled the sandwich or is this unlikely? And if so, should I be concerned/medical attention? Definitely able to breathe/talk, but am a little concerned about the breath shortness and cough."

"Our 17month old was in the ICU this past week due to low blood oxygen ( below 80%), and breathing problems. This is not the first time it happened, and in the prior times, she just slept through it, so we didn't think it was an issue.  This time, we had a sense that something was wrong, so that's why we measured her oxygen, and that's what triggered us to take her to the dr.

The Dr. didn't call it 'asthma', but just an 'asthma-like' attack.  basically, low oxygen level, super high heart rate, stomach pushing in and out rapidly, wheezing, etc. 

We got some meds home and once everything is stable, the dr advised to use Albuterol AS-NEEDED, and use it when we feel she may be having an attack.  

Overall, we feel much better and a bit more prepared, but in general, what bothers me is that I'm still not 100% sure when I something constitutes as an ""emergency"", and when to spray the albuterol.

&amp;#x200B;

For people here who have been through this......

would you spray albuterol as soon as the baby catches a cold?  would you wait until she starts to wheeze?

Would something be consituted as an ""ER"" situation only when all these symptoms occur?

The dr's seemed pretty casual about it and instructed to take her in when it's bad, but I""m just curious, for everyone who has been through this.....how do you handle it?"

Did my first lung peak flow test and it is 350. I‚Äôm a female that is 5 5 (and around 110 pounds) . Is that too low? I‚Äôve felt that I‚Äôve been having a little bit of a hard time breathing this week and also some chest muscle tension. I also have a hard time catching my breath after exercise. Should I go to a doctor or ?? I also have the second Covid shot in two days. Should I postpone? I have a previous lung valley fever nodule from a valley fever infection over ten years ago that caused me pleurisy.
"Hey everyone - has anyone ever experienced easy bruising while using their steroid inhalers? I've been  bruising super easily lately, to the point where I won't even let me dog jump up on me because I know it will leave a bruise. I got a bunch of blood work done this week to rule out leukemia or other blood disorders and my results came back completely normal. Then I came across a reddit comment about steroid inhalers causing easy bruising and there's a few medical papers backing it up. Has anyone experienced this themselves?"
"Greetings fam, recently (last month) been diagnosed with allergy induced asthma and wanted to see what was normal and what is not. 

Currently I‚Äôve been prescribed albuterol for when my chest feels tight, but that seems to be losing its effectiveness lately. Allergies are horrible here, does that affect asthma?

Also, my lungs literally feel inflamed, irritated, and it feels like my breath is ‚Äúhot‚Äù when I exhale: yeah I know, it even sounds stupid just tying it but it‚Äôs definitely an annoying/worrying sensation. Is this feeling in my lungs normal for asthma symptoms? Or is this the start of a flare and I need to go back to my doctor? Do I ride it out? 

As a kid I had to use a nebulizer for similar allergy symptoms, guess I never thought 20 years later my body would randomly go asthmatic.

Thanks for listening to my rant."
"I am feeling so frustrated!!!! I feel like I will never escape the asthma flare ups. Every year around this time my asthma will be doing so much better, and then it takes a nose dive. I feel so depressed knowing I‚Äôll have asthma forever. I feel so depressed knowing my lungs are damaged from all of the inhaler usage. What can I do to make my lungs stronger??? I don‚Äôt want to be constantly coughing up phlegm during allergy season. My allergies and asthma cause my anxiety to sky rocket. I feel so out of control when allergy meds and my inhaler aren‚Äôt helping. If I‚Äôm already struggling at 23 how will I be when I‚Äôm 60??? I‚Äôm nervous I won‚Äôt have a happy life if I can‚Äôt repair the damage and get things under control now!!!"
"So, I was recently diagnosed with asthma and have been using a Symbicort inhaler (dpi) for about two weeks now. I have been experiencing sore throat issues as one side effect (yesterday it seemed I had a really bad flare-up of laryngitis or something, because after a phone conversation my voice was very strained and then I developed significant throat pain for the rest of the night). I talked to my doctor and pharmacist today about that, and they want me to try it for a little longer and work on my inhaling technique to see if it gets better (and if not, they said they'd look into switching me).

But tonight I have been dealing with a horrible headache/migraine that won't go away with Tylenol. I have also had a few other headachey days over the past couple of weeks, so it just occurred to me tonight to Google whether that's a symbicort side effect, and I learned that it indeed is. I'm feeling kind of deflated, because between my throat and my head I've been in a ton of pain over the past couple of days. 

I already talked to both my doctor and pharmacist today about inhaler side effect stuff, so I don't really want to call them back again tomorrow about the headaches if I can avoid it. But I'm wondering if it's possible that the headaches will subside as my body gets more used to the medication? Did any experience headaches early on (or other side effects) and have them go away after using the inhaler for a bit longer? Or should I assume that I will just end up needing to switch to a different medication?"
"Fairly new to asthma, just diagnosed a few years ago. Recently had some really bad flare ups, and I'm taking 3 steroids. Prednisone, fluticasone, and montelukast. I've been on pred and montelukast for 3 days, and my anxiety is so bad I cried at work 3 times today. My depression was so bad  yesterday I had to call out of work. 

Then reading the labels apparently prednisone can cause anxiety, and montelukast can make anxiety and depression worse. I have my first appointment with a polmonologist in July. Anyone else have horrible side effects to taking steroids during a flare up? It's miserable, I almost want to stop taking them"
"If your first thought was ""that sounds like the first stage to COPD"" or ""Sounds like chronic bronchitis"" Yeah, that's what I started thinking after doing some research. My doc was never worried since I rarely have any asthma issues. Maybe one cough a day. My sp02 levels range from 97-99. And I have had this for YEARS. Just constant throat clearing every day. Even to the point where I went to a pulmonologist maybe  2-3 years ago and went under a gauntlet of tests and got the all-clear from the doc. I am bugging my new doc to send me to a new pulmonologist (I moved) to see what they think about it. But if every test came out completely fine, including the FEV, could it just be my asthma? they tried meds for acid reflux, allergies, etc. and I still have this dang mucus in my throat. I cough, but I do it purposefully to clear my throat. 

I am an ex-smoker, I was a pack-a-day guy from 15/16-22. I am now a vaper and my lungs are better than they ever were. And I had the mucus prior to the vaping btw. Any insight? Does anyone have anything similar?"

"For the past month since my move I‚Äôve been struggling a lot with my breathing and anxiety, it started off in spring time when it was hot and I was playing basketball and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breath in the hot air and my inhaler didn‚Äôt help at all I basically had a shower and waited it out and eventually I was fine. Now it‚Äôs a pretty constant feeling. I‚Äôve had lung tests and lung function tests which came back like 95% without inhaler and 118% after Ventolin.  And as of now I‚Äôm on symbicort 200 also. When I exhale I have this cough feeling and tightness. Also if I cough my lungs sound irritated but nothing comes up. I haven‚Äôt had an asthma attack since I was a kid and it was only around cats but for some reason I have been deathly afraid of having an asthma attack, I haven‚Äôt wheezed during any of this also. Reading a lot about asthma has made it a lot worse and I‚Äôve stopped going to the gym and doing anything physical right now. I‚Äôm afraid of it getting worse and I‚Äôm worried if I take my inhaler it won‚Äôt help and from what I‚Äôve heard that means hospital time. TLDR been having a lot of anxiety related to my asthma but tests have come back fine and started steroid inhaler"
I don't want to make a kid live the way I have had to.

"So, long story short I am having insurance issues and can‚Äôt get to the doctor so I will run out of advair. I‚Äôve been cutting down to just once a day the past few days to kind of wean myself off. Has anyone stopped advair kind of abruptly and did you have any side effects? My asthma is fairly mild, haven‚Äôt had to use my rescue inhaler in a couple years, so I‚Äôm not even sure if I still need to be on advair anyways."
"I wake up every morning with pops and cracks coming from my lungs, is this asthma?  Or some thing else?"
"Hello everyone. Hope the weather isn't treating you all too poorly. I plan to talk to my doctor about this when I see her at the end of the month but wanted to see if anyone had any input. 

To make a long story short, for a few months now I've been having asthma symptoms, especially in the morning or at night. I've had asthma since I was a babe so it wasn't a huge concern, but its becoming more frequent. Besides the shortness of breathing, coughing and chest pain, I've also been coughing up a lot of yellow to greenish mucus, especially after doing an asthma treatment. While the mucus isn't super new (having started a few months ago too) it's become a daily (sometimes multiple times a day) thing in the last month. And it comes up mostly in hour long coughing fits.

When these symptoms first started getting bad, I went to urgent care, got a very quick check up and was given antibiotics for possible bronchitis... I didn't take the antibiotics (I know, I know). The symptoms were annoying but manageable, especially the mucus which only happened for very short periods (I really didn't even think it was an actual problem). Months passed and it got a little worse and worse until May 2nd, when it started becoming a daily thing. 

I don't know how much mucus plays a part in asthma, if any. But even if it does, I've never had it this bad, never had it colored or everyday. The only other time I've had asthma symptoms everyday was last year for a few weeks but I went to the ER and was cleared. The only reason I'm wondering if there's a correlation is because the mucus mostly comes up after asthma meds. Should I be more concerned about this? Right now its more of an annoyance but I have taken notice in the increase of symptoms. Are there other things I should be looking for, taking note of? Has anyone else experienced this? It's becoming a bigger part of my day than I ever thought it would so I'm curious, naturally.

I'd really appreciate any feedback if possible! Thanks\~"
"Hello all,

I have had mild asthma my whole life, and never really used my inhalers and just dealt with the problems. The last couple months it has gotten really bad and my doctor put me back on Flovent. I have been using it twice a day for about the last three weeks. My asthma problems have improved dramatically but I have had pretty bad sinus issues (sneezing, runny nose, coughing, mild headaches, and watery eyes) for about 8 days now. I don't really feel weak, have low energy or have a high temperature like a typical cold would. I am starting to wonder if potentially it is the new Flovent inhaler causing the sinus issues... Has anyone else had similar symptoms after starting Flovent?"
"Are there alternatives to steroids? I‚Äôm not having the best of luck and rather scared of what I‚Äôm reading and what I‚Äôm feeling. I have had and al having some nasty side effects to the inhaled corticosteroid and I‚Äôm also reading the long term damage or effects are also pretty nasty. It‚Äôs hard because I‚Äôm getting a mixed emotion from two diff groups here. One being people say it‚Äôs directly inhaled and this just can‚Äôt be it. To two, it is true and they CAN cause nasty effects. I was put on Flovent after showing mild obstruction. My PFT raised 30% three weeks being on flovent. She labeled it as asthma based on three total PFT‚Äôs but only one was showing mild obstruction. I‚Äôm not even sure if the sudden shortness of breath I had come on me literally OVERNIGHT is asthma or what. I did suffer a massive GERD reflux attack that was what felt like straight better acid in my throat for a week straight despite prescription meds.. few days after that the weird feeling in my lungs began. Held off two months and it felt my breathing was getting harder and harder. So that lead to the PFT.. and now Flovent. I do not like the side effects and it is the ONLY thing that has changed and I have never in my life been so short fused to the point it scares me, yet I miss one dose and I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe! What does this sound like and what alternatives can there be with less side effects? Sure. Everyone metabolizes meds and handles them differently of course.. but anyone else In same boat? 

I also suffer Graves‚Äô disease/ hyperthyroidism and these steroids make my hyperthyroidism that‚Äôs in remission feel as though it‚Äôs not. Just had my labs ran and I‚Äôm in normal range. 

Side effects: 
Night sweats (bad)
Agitation/short fuse (not like me at all)
Intrusive thoughts (scary)
Feeling hot to touch with no fever
Blurry vision at times
Vertigo here and there 
Mucus (never had mucus before Flovent)
Head pressure out of this world
No adrenaline 
Loss of smell slightly not fully (covid negative)
Feeling depressed some and I never suffer depression"
"I am sharing a room temporarily with someone - (1-2 months). The past few days she's been spraying something that feels super toxic. I'm not sure if it's deodarent or hairspray. Anyway the times she sprayed it in the evenings I aired out the room. 

But when she sprays it in the mornings I'm still trying to sleep and it triggers my asthma. Then I can't get enough sleep and am left with aggravated Airways. 

I didn't want to say anything because I don't want to make life inconvenient for her but honestly it feels really bad for my airways so I can't hold back any longer. 

Do you think it's reasonable to request that she doesn't spray it in the room? Ps we don't have a window or I'd suggest she just open it."
"Hey all, I'm curious, and my research has so far proven futile.

(Personal context: My first Asthma attack was when I was 6, and once I hit 18-20, it leveled off. I'm in my mid-30s now. I'm a trained vocalist who had to stop singing years ago because of a Hiatus Hernia and severe GERD. About 8 weeks ago, I had a Nissen Fundoplication and the surgeon also sutured the hernia closed. This has had little to no practical effect on what I'm going to ask about, but the GERD *might* have caused damage, hence the mention.)

I typically experience a higher-pitched expiratory wheeze, which at least *feels* like it comes more from the upper end of my lower respiratory tract (ie. between the larynx, and where the main bronchi branch off). 

In the last year, with no preceding attacks or worsening of my condition, and only based on my sporadic blue puffer usage (salbutamol/albuterol), my doctors put me on QVAR and then Flovent, with little to no discernable improvement in the wheeze. (I'm on disability for other reasons, and have not been prescribed, nor been able to afford a Peak Flow Meter out of pocket. I will be getting one soon, with a settlement of sorts *FINALLY* on the horizon.) I am using my blue puffer a *TOUCH* less than I used to, down from 1-2 times a week, to maybe once every 7-10 days. Even still though, I have this expiratory high pitch wheeze. When I *do* take the blue puffer, the wheeze lessens to some extent, but it's still present.

To me, it's pretty concerning because the consistent wheeze comes across as a sign of something still not being addressed or investigated, but whenever any GP I've seen in 3 different clinics now (because hunting down a good doc for my other conditions is super-difficult) has listened to my chest, they will tell me it sounds clear and write off my concern without any explanation. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Are there resources for like, comparing wheeze sounds/patterns to specific areas of the lungs affected by conditions? Am I just being hyperbolic and anxious?"
I‚Äôve been having what I call breathing episodes for like a couple months now and I do have asthma and anxiety but it got worse last night and Im not sure if I‚Äôve been having asthma attacks or panic attacks or both I just find it very hard to breathe and I have to put a lot of effort and thought into breathing it‚Äôs like my body forgets to breathe or how to breathe
"I was diagnosed with asthma 1.5 year ago, even though I've come to find out my parents knew I had it when I was a kid but they refused to treat me for it. I don't think it's mild asthma, either.

I've been pretty awful about treating it myself because I had the hardest time accepting the diagnosis was true and then I've also lived with untreated asthma for so long that I can't quite tell when I'm having symptoms, so I never use the rescue inhaler and I kept going off the maintenance inhaler, too, sometimes for months at a time. 

That said, I've been pretty consistent about using sirdupla, which my doctor prescribed, for the last two months (two puffs in the morning and another two at night) and I'm also randomly using my rescue inhaler, trying to figure out when and how it helps. I've also been taking antihistamines for the past couple of weeks.

I have an appointment with my doctor two days from now but in the meantime, I'm concerned that I haven't seen much improvement. I still have plenty of trouble breathing, I have a hard time being indoors with a mask on, I have a stuffed nose and, I think, chest tightness.

So, my question is, where do I go from here? Is there anything else I can do to help my symptoms? Also, what is a rescue inhaler supposed to do exactly, I've never noticed any improvement after using it, lol."

"I‚Äôm visiting my pcp again soon and was thinking of asking about asthma. I just wanted to mention a few symptoms here to see what you guys think. I‚Äôve been asking docs about this same set of symptoms for years now. 

Pressure in chest, especially lower abdomen as if I can‚Äôt fully exhale. Thought this was digestion but it never fully relieves.  

Shortness of breath, walking out into humidity I gasp for air sometimes being introduced to the humidity. And my deep breaths always feel a bit labored. I‚Äôm often lightheaded and experience constant mental fog. 

I can‚Äôt seem to make more gains working out despite how consistent I‚Äôve been. I get tired too easily. I‚Äôm chronically fatigued."

"Question for people with asthma: Is the feeling of shortness of breath 24/7 or only when the asthma is triggered? 

I am diagnosed with asthma but the inhalers (Albuterol) hasn‚Äôt really been helpful. Wonder why? And I have the constant feeling of breathlessness with or without the use of inhaler"
Does anyone else get unbelievably dry skin from Dupixent? Does anything help?
"For 10 years I‚Äôve had these issues constantly pushed off as anxiety, now I am tackling them. I‚Äôm 32, male, quit cigarettes after 12 years last year to lower nicotine vape / trying to quit. I am overweight by about 40 lbs. I cannot exercise much to push it forward besides gentle walking.

I‚Äôve discovered:

Sleep apnea (treated for 2 months with success in many issues and getting off caffeine)

High blood pressure treated for 5 years

High cholesterol for 5 years.

Been on antidepressants for 10 years with a change last year since I started having extreme issues again.

But my problems are not mentally triggered‚Ä¶

It appears my issues get worse in a few situations:

1-physical activity, sex, masturbation triggers it rather quickly

2-sinus congestion when not using high humidity on cpap

3-high stress but I rarely have this now


My issues are mostly (which come all together):

-diarrhea frequently 

-confusion

-focus issues

-shortness of breath

-dizziness or lightheadedness followed after

-full head and head pressures and vice grip type of feeling

-fatigue / lack of motivation or wanting to get up
-back / muscle ache

-sometimes chest tightness

-ear pressure / popping like feeling

-sinus congestion and making it harder to breathe out of my nose

-all of the above then trigger feelings of anxiety/stress due to what I‚Äôm going through

I can‚Äôt quite workout because of dealing with this. I‚Äôve done testosterone tests, anti nuclear tests, diabetic testing, blood clot testing, ekg, heart stress test, ultrasound on heart, cut out caffeine (which eliminated the randomness of symptoms), cortisol 24 hr testing, lymes, thyroid, thyroid antibodies, sed rate, vitamins, Dhea-s, CBC, compressive metabolic, d dimmer, a1c, hs cpr."
I was diagnosed with mild asthma on Thursday via histamine provocation test. It surprised me because I never had asthma symptoms and I went to the doctor for a chronic cough. I was prescribed Symbicort Turbuhaler but since the test I do have asthma symptoms and I feel my lungs constantly. The inhaler doesn't seem to do much yet but it has only been a few days. Is this normal?
"Been taking montelukast for over 3 years. But only recenty i started wondering if some of my major problems like anxiety (more than usual), mood swings, trouble sleeping and ibs like symptoms might be linked to taking the medication since it was the only meds i was on except the inhaler. Its been 2 weeks now and i can say my anxiety is getting wayyy better than before and ive noticed my stomach isnt as problematic like usual. I feel my body was adapting to the drug which was quite scary for me since im quite young."
"I was originally diagnosed with asthma in 2017, but never took my inhalers or never had virtually and problem with my breathing after the diagnosis.

Fast forward to today, I can hardly walk short distances or up hills without having breathing difficulties. I‚Äôm confused on why this is happening because last year I was able to cycle 40 Miles per day without any problem... I‚Äôm 19 years old and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal, any advice or help would be appreciated"
I wore a mask outside while walking around. It helped but I should have used my inhaler ugh. I have mild asthma so it's a big deal but still I'm in MA and it's going to be 100 for a couple of days and in the 90's as well as humidity‚Äã. I have an AC thankfully...
"Hey guys so let me start off by saying I've never been fully dignosed with asthma but do have allergic asthma my Dr thinks

So today I went with my GF to a brewery was feeling fine, took some nasal spray then decided to take my moms dog with us I'm allergic but live with the dog but he's not allowed in the basement were i live

Drove us there I was fine thr dog sat on our laps but I was outside allergies didn't bother me

We got home and took a nap away from the dog but still wearing clothes with dog hair

I woke up coughing like crazy and took my inhaler took allergy meds and went outside felt better
Had a beer or 2 went back inside

Sat with the dog till my mom got home started coughing again showered to wash all dog hair off

But I've been up all night coughing up phlegm and my chest and throat are sore and I actually threw up from coughing so much

Could this relate to asthma or I'm I just getting sick?

Could I have inhaled a dog hair some how? I'm sure symptoms would have went away now?

I'm allergic but thr dog rarely bother me that bad"
"So, like a complete dummy, I used an air freshener today all over my house. I was having company over for the first time in over a year and decided to compensate for it by splashing my house with Febreeze after I cleaned. The cleaning was enough...no idea why I decided to take it further. I'm definitely allergic to it. Sprayed at around 5pm and I was up at 1 a.m. coughing and I haven't stopped. 

The question is...how do I get it off everything?! Like, do I have to pull all my curtains down and wash them? Cause I really doused shit. Ug."

"Hey guys! So basically I‚Äôve only had asthma for a year now, but it‚Äôs continuously getting worse. I‚Äôve made a big mistake by falling down the webMD rabbit hole and everytime I search a symptom I think I have lung cancer LOL. Idek what I‚Äôm trying to say or ask it‚Äôs just that anxiety and asthma is a horrible mixüòû I refuse to get on a plane and the fact that someone in my community my age died from asthma last year never leaves my mind. I can‚Äôt even play sports anymore and the back pain that I have from asthma doesn‚Äôt even let me sleep. Thank you for listening to my rantüòÑ"
"I‚Äôve just started getting some treatment for exercise induced asthma with no success yet. I‚Äôm hoping some others can relate to my specific symptoms. I do not experience chest pain like many others. 

Instead, when I run I have trouble breathing and do have a strider. 

After running is the worst. Within a few minutes, my mouth fills up with tons of thick saliva, forcing me to continuously spit. It also gets very dry in my mouth. This causes me to cough. My cough is extreme many times, more like a gag. I feel like I‚Äôm going to throw up and I have multiple times. 

Hours after I run I have throat pain. 

If it is cold outside, the dry mouth is even worse and that is the absolute worse time for me to run. I can‚Äôt even run outside under 60 degrees anymore. I‚Äôm also 19, in great shape, I exercise a lot and am in the normal weight range. 

I have been using albuterol but it has not stopped these symptoms at all. Additionally, I do peak flow measures- my normal is 550. After albuterol, 2 puffs before run, it is 600. 8 minutes after run it is 550. Shouldn‚Äôt my peak flow be staying the same at 600 if the inhaler was working? 

Does anyone relate to this or have any idea what could be triggering this? Thank you"
"I've had asthma since I was 5, and recently it's gotten worse (21 now). I go to college full time and was working a full-time job and had health insurance for a month or two before I had to quit due to the drama and toxicity. It's also hard working full-time and going to school. 

So now, I can't afford my Albuterol. Non-emergency is $213 without insurance!! I feel screwed. I've applied for women's insurance, and regular but the cheapest plan was $150/mo (so a no for me once again). My only option is to suffer, lose sleep, whistle/wheeze, cough, and always have a tight chest. I bought a $28 primatene mist from Walmart that definitely helps, but it also makes the symptoms come back more rapidly since it only masks the problem. 

Just dumb how a college student with no job was quoted such a high amount plan, and even when I work part time I can't afford that on top of rent, groceries, personal items, gas, phone bill, etc

Like I didn't choose the asthma life!! The asthma life chose me and it's only getting harder to function. I feel helpless man"
"I am a 22 year old female and I wanted to reach out because I am really struggling right now. I used to be fit, ate pretty well and exercised daily. I then began to have a very difficult time exercising and with my sports, and was diagnosed by my allergist with allergy-induced asthma. I‚Äôve taken Zyrtec every day forever, did allergy shots for 4 years, have a steroid inhaler and a rescue albuterol inhaler. Over the last 4 years I got busy with college and the college lifestyle of drinking, fast food, slacking on exercise and put on 30 pounds. I get down on myself remembering where I was as a lean athlete, and try getting back into that lifestyle, but I have a hard time biking a couple miles without having phlegm to cough up, feeling like my throat is constricting and needing to violently cough. I am just feeling at a loss trying to figure out a way to turn my life around in a way that works for me. I wanted to give a more well-rounded story so that you all can understand the perspective I come from. Any advice or encouragement on how to control my asthma better or how you lost weight/maintain a healthy lifestyle with asthma would be much appreciated!"
"I can't believe it's been over half a year already! I thought it might be helpful to people if I shared where I was now, for people who are curious about Dupixent or potentially about to start it. 

How things are going:

\-I can honestly say that I feel much better than I have in a loooong time. After like, months of waiting for Dupixent to really start working, I think it's *actually* working. My measure for this is that I used to not be able to walk around my block before Dupixent without having to go on a prednisone burst after. A couple months ago I was able to walk around the block, but it typically took me about three days to recover back to my baseline. Now, I can actually walk for several miles a day, as long as I take my inhalers beforehand, and feel totally fine after. I'm still not really used to this feeling, it seems like a dream! My FitBit is now actually a FitBit again and not just a sporty looking watch, lol (-:

What I wish I knew:

\-I wish I knew that it actually takes a really long time to start working. I mean, I did know that to some extent when I started it. But most studies apparently found that people experience the full effects after about a year, so I guess it's all uphill from here. Stick with it!

\-Side effects are not predictable. There's not really a pattern to how my body reacts to Dupixent after I take it, which is sort of a draw but if you go into it knowing that, there's fewer surprises. The side effects for me started with headaches a day or two after the injection, which was replaced by dry eyes. I had a moment about a month ago where I thought I might have become allergic to Dupixent due to some purplish red spots on my legs, but after a lot of (probably really annoying) messages to my doctor, I found out that it was actually erythma nodosum, which was unsightly but has gradually been going away. I can only assume that there will be more *wonderful (-:* various effects of Dupixent in the future, but the tradeoff is worth it by far. I've been on medications a lot more common that Dupixent and had much worse experiences. 

\-YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR INJECTION SITES. I know this seems obvious, but I really got into like a ""comfort zone"" of injecting in one spot. Switching it up reduces those injection site reactions.

Anyway, I hope this is helpful to someone and not just me ranting because I'm happy it's working! If you're starting Dupixent, good luck to you (-:"
"I know this just came out, but apparently people who suffer from autoimmune disorders or take immunosuppressive drugs may have lower efficacy in the vaccine. Symbicort is a corticosteroid, so does anyone think that this medicine might be included? I take two puffs of Symbicort daily.

It's a long shot to ask but i'm so scared all over again, especially now that I've gone out a couple of times in the past weeks. (I am fully vaccinated, still wearing a mask and socially distancing) I will be calling my doctor on Monday to ask, I was just wondering if anyone else knows anything."
"I‚Äôm on Symbicort. I take two puffs in the morning and two at night. I try to be very mindful when I do take it but I often get distracted from day dreaming and adhd. 

My question is what happens if you take too much at once? Is one extra dose going to be harmful?"

I found out I had Samter‚Äôs triad in conjunction with my Asthma Randomly. I used NSAIDS a lot as a kid but around the age of 23 I was magically allergic to them and some Motrin caused a terrible asthma attack. Any of you with a similar story/discovery?
"I have a problem.. my asthma has been relatively mild my entire life, but recently my breathing problems have been worse. But so has my anxiety. 

I have trouble separating anxiety shortness of breath from asthma. My doctor says to take the inhaler regardless if it‚Äôs anxiety or asthma causing trouble breathing, but that makes me worried.

I get anxious about taking my Albuterol because on the medication paper thing that came with it, it said there‚Äôs a risk of death from Albuterol and that scares me so I try not to use it when I don‚Äôt need to

I need advice, am I crazy for being worried? How do I know if it‚Äôs anxiety or asthma lol does anyone else struggle the same? I‚Äôll probably talk more about it with my doctor soon"
"Supposedly, hitting my Albuterol inhaler every day means my asthma is ""poorly controlled."" But this is the only thing that controls it. I'm on Montelukast/Singulair, and I've got a Flovent inhaler that does nothing. I take lots of herbs and keep away from irritants... But at night my lungs get so full of mucus I can't breathe well enough to sleep, unless I take two puffs of Albuterol.

Does anybody else deal with this? Are there really any long-term bad reasons to take Albuterol every day, when the alternative is no sleep? Anybody have experience with Albuterol becoming less effective over time?"
"Hey guys I'm just curious.. I've always had super low Peak Flow ratings.. i'm talking bout 280-310 readings.  My wife who has some lung fibrosis even has higher ratings than me.  I've searched these forums and see people here who have terrible asthma have higher Peak Flow Ratings than me.

I only feel my asthma when I catch a cold really. It often turns into a chest cold, but in every day life I don't ever use my inhaler, I never wheeze, and I do some BJJ on a regular; a martial art that is similar to HIIT in terms of exhaustion.  I've never had the best endurance and i breathe really hard compared to other people, but I still never need to use my inhaler as my chest doesn't get tight or anything.

I guess i'm trying to find out what does this Peak Flow Meter indicate exactly?  Does it just tell me I have really bad lung capacity?  Thanks for any responses"
"Recently I started to notice my preventative inhaler never worked for the whole time or all 120 puffs. It would reach 40 and stop working. Then, yesterday, I came across a post here saying that the medicine gunk from before could be clogging it. I just cleaned it and took it and I feel better than ever!! Here's how to clean your inhaler, if its a meter dose inhaler!

"This might be a long shot but does anyone here do the new Xolair self injection? 

I've been on Xolair on and off for years, but am going to be traveling a bunch in the next few months so my doctor proposed the self injection at least for a little while but the photos online look like it's a straight up needle not just an autoinjector like an epipen or some other self injected biologics. I don't normally have a huge issue with needles (getting allergy shots and xolair for years will do that to you) but I get squeamish thinking about actually jabbing myself vs someone else doing it when I don't have to look.

So anyone do the xolair self injection? If so how is it? Is the needle as terrible as it seems?"
"I don't know if I have asthma but since the 27th of May I started having difficulty breathing, it's difficult to inhale air more than to exhale and I'm having that feeling like there's tightness in my throat.

"I have terrible asthma and I want to know about Aqi.  Whenever I look at the Aqi (air quality index) of any country it is always different.  For example in Chelyabinsk, Russia, whereby all of the citizens of that area say that it smells badly, it says it is usually only at 10 which is extremely good.  In Saint Petersburg, it is 25, but many say that its one of the more polluted cities in Europe as well as Moscow.  What is this, just false news?  What's correct, the 'Airvisual' Aqi (that I use) or the news reports I've read; considering how unreliable some Aqi reports can be, even though the one I have is said to be accurate.  The news is pretty unreliable too.  Aah, somebody please help"
"So I‚Äôm in the process of being evaluated for asthma (it could also be vocal chord dysfunction, but the asthma meds seem to have some effect on the tests as well) and I‚Äôm trying to figure out what triggers it 

I‚Äôve fainted a few times, and I know that one factor when that happens is severe tightness in the upper chest muscles (bad posture+bruxism/tmj) 

I‚Äôm also on adhd meds that make my mouth super dry. It‚Äôs super pollen season here in Sweden right now;

The air out is also super dry and my nose feels like a desert. 

Can those things be triggers?"
"I know that a lot of asthmatics use spacers, and for most of those people I constantly hear how annoying the bulkiness of spacers are. So why has someone not designed a collapsable one already? I'm struggling to find them online, and the few I do find barely collapse at all.

Perhaps someone with more or a professional medical understanding knows the answer?"
"Long story short I live with narcissistic family members who KNOW I have asthma and barely stay away from me when they smoke. One is literally a chain smoker who smokes every 5 minutes. I move out in October thankfully but until then, how should I avoid the second hand smoke? My asthma has been relatively mild but I don‚Äôt want it to get worse"

"Fairly new to asthma, recently had ALOT of flare ups and my pcp cant see me until August. I have some questions to others with asthma hopefully someone can help:

1) my lungs sometimes ache, the past few days it's been a constant dull ache and it's getting annoying now. Drinking warm liquid like coffee is super soothing, as are baths. Are there any safe pain meds I can take for achy lungs? I read I'm supposed to avoid NSAIDS.

2) is achy lungs common with asthma? I can breathe fine at the moment, but the ache is still there. Is achy lungs a sign of a mild asthma attack or should I expect this every now and again? 

3)I have no idea what my triggers are. But I get asthma attacks so randomly. What tests should I ask for at my doctor's to find specifically what my triggers are?

Thanks in advance"
"Background: a few years ago I started getting short of breath going up and down the stairs at my work. Around the same time cardio has getting harder and ai lost interest in it. I had the respirometry test done and the technician said to me ""You're not asthmatic, but you aren't normal either.""

My doctor looked at the report and just said ""You're negative.""

When I go for a run now, I feel like I'm blowing up way too easily, like 4km into a 10km run I'm gasping. Or if I do something involving heavy exertion, I end up shallow rapid breathing for quite sometime afterwards.

So basically trying to figure out if it's EIA or if I'm getting old. (Also have eczema and hayfever.)

Thanks."

"Compared to most of you, my asthma is relatively mild, and pretty well controlled by the meds.  However, (and why even post this if there isn't a however?), I was driving in town one day, and the car ahead of me was apparently contained a vaper, and a big cloud of cotton-candy smoke came out of his window and into mine (nice day, windows were open). 
My. Lungs. Shut. Down.   I had to pull over and dig my puffer out of my purse before I passed out from lack of oxygen.  OMG.  This was a new experience for me, and I was horrified!!  Thank goodness the puffer did it's job and I was okay to drive later.  I will definitely mention this to my pulmonologist at my next visit.
Has this happened to anyone else??   And I'm so sorry!"
"I'm currently on breo. Dulera and symbacourt are way too much money as well. Does anyone have a replacement that would be say... Under a hundred bucks a month? Even the symbacourt generic is still like 290 ish in my area. Or does anyone have any tips for getting asthma meds without insurance? I'm in Houston, Texas if that helps. Thank you so much."
"Hello everyone, I‚Äôve had asthma all of my life but mostly have it under control (knock on wood). Recently though I have relocated for an internship in Wilmington, NC and everyday I have been waking up with shortness of breath and a stuffy nose. I was curious if you guys have any recommendations on what I could do, whether it be an air purifier or some allergy meds that will help me. I am tired of this and as it is affecting my job."
"I've noticed that when my asthma is acting up, I cough during a spirometry test. And when it's well controlled I don't. 

There was a fire recently that set off some asthma attacks. It's been a week and a half since and I'm feeling better but still coughing during the spirometry."
"Hi everyone,

I live in an old house - with huge stone walls that are still cold from winter. outside is 25 degrees and inside is 15 degrees (in celsius).   

So I started a fire to get warm. Anyway the smoke never went up the chimney and has filled the house instead. ***So asthma triggered. Breathing problems etc, etc.*** The place is a mess right now. Anyone got tips for clearing out the smoke? And the after- smell? I opened the door and the windows but it's taking a really long time to get normal again.

Thanks!"
How did it go for you? My doctor's just put me on it.

"Hi, just curious to see if this happens. I‚Äôm on the lowest dose twice a day. After I take it I feel much worse shortness of breath so I‚Äôm stopping it today. My allergist/asthma doctor prescribed prednisone to replace it, but my psychiatrist is adamant I do not take steroids (due to mental illness.) He has even called my doctor to complain. 

I‚Äôm very conflicted to say the least. Does anyone struggle to tolerate steroids? I know symbicort is a combination steroid, I am on it because I could not handle inhaled steroids. 

What do you do if steroids aren‚Äôt an option, if you‚Äôve had this experience? I don‚Äôt want to seek medical advice here, but right now my doctors cannot agree and I can barely breathe."
I just want to sleep. I‚Äôm a ball of anxiety and rage. Benadryl has quit working. Anyone else found something that helps take the edge off
"Hello, I just moved into a room in a house, and my land lady, who lives downstairs, has asthma. I am a regular user of vape products, and upon learning of her asthma, I discontinued vaping inside and on the property. She has been really great about this, and I feel quite awful she's experiencing problems. However, since I've stopped (I do still vape in my car on the way home and on walks around the neighborhood) she has mentioned having reactions when upstairs near my bedroom, and as her office is down the hall from my room, this seems like it could become a real issue for her. 
So, as someone with almost no knowledge of asthma, I'm asking you all, what do you think is going on here, and is there anything short of quitting vaping that might help? I can't quite understand what the issue is if all vaping is done and blown away before I'm within 1/4 mile of the house. 
As a side note, I do have two cats, but she has lived with cats and was fine with them from the start, and has not mentioned having any sensitivity to cats (she also has dogs), but only a sensitivity to smoke.
Any ideas, suggestions etc? This woman is a saint and though this is temporary, I can't stand thinking I'm making her uncomfortable in her own home."
"So today is a bad breathing day. But the breathing feels off in my throat.. like I‚Äôm getting good deep breaths but I feel off in my throat where my voice box is and below it. Like a rubber band type feeling or a wheeze feeling but I‚Äôm not wheezing? Idk how to describe the feeling but it makes me scared I‚Äôll stop breathing... HR is also higher today after Flovent but idk if Flovent affects the HR? Just off today and I sometimes can‚Äôt tell is is meds, asthma, my thyroid... need some advice because I‚Äôm scared but I don‚Äôt want to go to ER !"
"Does anyone else get these coughing fits where it‚Äôs hard to breathe, chest is tight and the only thing that helps is inhaler or really a breathing treatment? This is how my asthma is presenting and I‚Äôm just curious if it‚Äôs this way for anyone else."
"When I was younger(1-3) I used to have extremely severe asthma, I used to go to the ER weekly if not daily, and had to take several different asthma inhalers, like 5 or 6 of them daily. Once it disappeared because my doctor sent us on a trip to a salt mine in the mountains{transylvania} and it just magically disappeared. When I was 8-14 years old and if I done intense exercise I had some wheezing.In the meantime I did not exercise enough and become obese. Last year in december I got a little asthma attack, I couldn't breath. We went to the doctor, I got some injection and some pills. Next day they sent me to the ER for a full check-up (blood sample, chest x-ray, etc) [I love free universal healthcare] and got a nice trip to the pneumologist. I had to take Ventolin and Symbicort(symbicort daily 2 doses and ventolin when neceseary). We would have to return after the symbicort have ran out but you know COVID happened and we didn't want to go there. Fast forward to today, I am not taking my medications, but I have ventolin at hand. I am planning to go to the pneumologist this or next month. Should I go to a visit ASAP?"
"I've been put through the ringer a bit with testing for my symptoms. The main reason a general internist is seeing me is because I've ended up in the ER too many times for shortness of breath (SOB) on or without exertion with one or more of the following: tachycardia, persistent cough, generalized itching, chest pain, hoarse voice/frog in throat, neck pain, and/or low grade fever with bad chills. O2 is always fine, just heart rate high and sometimes hypertension. SOB is band enough ieven whenƒ∫ I can't complete sentences or coughing nonstop.

One doctor thinks I have a mast cell disorder and this doctor doesn't necessarily disagree but says he can only focus on one thing, my breathing. So = asthma.

My PFT came back normal, it was stressful but good results. I was taking pulmicort and singulair which could've made results better. 

1.75 months of pulmicort 800 mcg reduced my SOB, fevers, lower chest pain, and migratory joint pain. Then the last week I'm getting the chest pain and SOB again. So they've switched me to Advair with 2 puffs daily. 

Is this more helpful? Idk. He said I'll need the Ventolin less and should recover faster from my SOB spells, said the chest pain will go away too. 

Current meds = advair 120 mcg 2 puffs twice daily, singulair 10 mg, pepcid 20 mg twice daily, Rupatadine 40 mg, cromolyn 100 mg twice daily, and ventolin + epi PRN."
"When I say cured what I mean is take it from a getting out of breath walking to being able exercise rigoursly. It's still most certainly there but a lot less.

To give some context I'm 23 (M) and have been living with Asthmha since birth pretty much I currently take  fostair as a preventive daily which works nicely without noticeable side effects.

The biggest triggers I have discovered for my Asthmha is allergies, I am allergic to basically everything, pollen, fungal spores, dust, dog dander etc as well as a huge amount of foods. 

So what I have done over the last few years is have allergy tests and take out all those foods and anything else I notice triggering my symptoms. I currently eat the same things everyday more or less - white rice and Avocados/frozen chopped spinach mixed with olive oil and split pea protein powder, bananas, mangoes, dates, apple juice blueberries, potatoes and sweet potatoes and a few more things. I take a few vitamins and all my levels are healthy (micro/macro nutrients) currently. It's restricting but more than worth it as a trade in for my breath. I attribute this to the biggest improvement.

Salt inhalers have also been really helpful as well as a product called Bioserum, woody knows nasal air filters have been a life saver in the past when exposed to airborne allergens and nose breathing in general helps. Changing my bedroom floor to laminate the use of an air purifier, I never use fragrance items my deodorant is a natural Alum salt, turmeric in the past has been helpful. All of the cleaning products, wash products are natural, I wash my bed sheets at 60 degrees C

Meditation has been a huge help, I've been practicing  since I was 18; it's helped with my breathing technique as well as the hopelessness and suffering of this disease over the years, with out It would have ended up in a really grim place mentally and stayed there. Also being selective of my workplace as I was once working in workshops/factories as an Engineer, changing that helped.

I've seen the most improvements over the last year and half and hope to continue that way unfortunately I was diagnosed last year with Ulcerative colitis but thanks to the NHS and big pharma that's under control now. The universe obviously decided I was having it to easy suddenly ü§£

Of course this is subjective but I can back it up through my own improvement and worsening of symptoms if I slip up

Any questions let me know.

Tldr; Salt inhalers, removing certain foods, bioserum, nasal filters, air purifiers, laminate flooring, meditation, nose breathing, fragrance free have all helped."
"I‚Äôd like to use my inhaler without my ability to breathe suddenly becoming even worse for a few minutes. It eventually returns to normal and works as it should, but that sudden plummet is awful."
"I'm looking for things to help with my asthma (out of the box solutions welcome lol). I've been using the juli health app ([www.juli.co/asthma](https://www.juli.co/asthma)) and it's so simple (helps me identify triggers and I got some surprising results) but it's been a game changer for me. Now I'm looking for similar things that I might simply not have been thinking of (as I wouldn't have thought of an app hadn't someone recommended it). Is there any online class, any other 'out of the box' resource like a lung friendly cook book or anything like this? lol This might be a funny question but I think these things can make SUCH a difference and I'd like to share more advices and keep becoming an advocate for a better life"

"Hey guys, I'm new here. I don't have Asthma all the time, mine is related to pollen. It's been kicking my ass this year, and I wonder how long it'll take to notice some difference from the bufomix easyhaler? Asking cause I googled this and really couldn't find much information on the topic. I do one inhalation each morning and evening."
"I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with asthma but do have a deviated septum. In highschool I had walking pneumonia  a few times for like three weeks. I also had a 3 month long sickness while I did gymnastics. For the three months I constantly had super super serious coughing, hacking, and wheezing. I couldn‚Äôt even laugh or go a minute without coughing. I never got diagnosed with anything when I went to the doctor thoguh but it was a super super intense sickness and the coughs were very intense. Could this be asthma ??

I did have a good amount of dairy today so maybe I could be Intolerant to that. I feel mucousy after dairy. But Ik my dad has vitiligo and thyroid issues so there r autoimmune issues in my family"

"Hi all. I had a few questions about my asthma and what I could do to prevent flare ups. I was diagnosed with mild asthma last year and hadn‚Äôt had to use my inhaler for about a year up until about a week ago when I got a cold and it seems to be flaring up. My questions were related to the symptoms and how to identify them and also what cleaning I might be able to do or what I could do to find out if something is irritating my asthma. I‚Äôm still not 100% sure about how wheezing sounds and feels but I think I have an idea of what it‚Äôs like. Since I‚Äôve had the cold I‚Äôve had chest congestion and when I forcefully breathe out I can feel it kinda ‚Äúshake‚Äù in my chest. Is that what wheezing feels like? Also with asthma flare ups, does wheezing happen with normal breathing or forceful exhalation? Also, regarding cleaning, my house is older and pretty dusty and I have unkempt carpets and an AC unit in my window and my dad smokes inside. It sounds awful, I know, and it is, but I‚Äôll be moving out in the fall for school. It sometimes feels like my breathing is worse in my house. I was thinking of buying a mold detection kit to see if there was any in my room or anything. I also have a small air purifier with a HEPA filter in it. Does anyone have any other tips or product recommendations on how I can get any other irritants out of the carpets or walls or AC? Also would it be a good idea to put a humidifier in my room? I figured it might help. Thanks for any help with my issues!"
"Anyone else feel their chest pain/tightness get worse after using a rescue inhaler? I use Albuterol. Most of the time it helps but today the pain got worse after using it which I found odd. Curious about others experience, if it happens sometimes, if anyone knows why it happens, etc. I‚Äôm newly diagnosed so I‚Äôm still learning.

Not looking for medical advice (I have a great doc and can ask him next appt), just curious about others experience."
"I‚Äôve been having episodes of throat tightness for years and can‚Äôt figure out if it‚Äôs asthma, acid reflux, or something else... it‚Äôs strange because it‚Äôs primarily in my throat. right under my adam‚Äôs apple where my neck meets my chest. it‚Äôs very uncomfortable, but i think i‚Äôm able to breathe and get oxygen okay. i might cough or clear my throat a lot. sometimes it even makes me gag. i‚Äôm able to eat and drink okay, although sometimes i feel like swallowing makes it worse. sometimes it feels like my tongue, neck, and shoulder muscles are all tightened up. it can last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, and come and go during the day. it‚Äôs kind of unclear to me if it gets better with my albuterol inhaler or not. sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. i‚Äôve had an ECG and my esophagus is normal. i do have cough-variant asthma, but haven‚Äôt had much experience with the classic, wheezy type asthma, which is why i feel unsure. anyone else have this sort of issue?"
So I‚Äôve been taking my steroid inhaler for nearly 2 weeks now. And last Friday I noticed like a scratching pain in the back of my throat only when I drink liquids and sometimes tastes salty. Could this be down to the use of my brown inhaler ? Thanks
"Am I correct in thinking that FEV1 of 2.04L and 48%Pred mean that I'm actually only have 48% lung capacity of what other people have?

"Hi, just recently gor diagnosed with asthma and wondering if abdominal tightness can be a symptom.
Sometimes it feels like I have a corset on making it hard to take full breaths."
"So far this is what I‚Äôve introduced: 
Montelukast, Allegra, azelastine, and simbicort (for asthma and allergies). I use a Honeywell air purifier, plus a merv 11 HVAC filter. I try to avoid dairy and smoked foods. I wear my mask outside. I avoid too high of heat and too high of humidity (keep my fan going when I shower) 

What else can I do?"
"I'll be travelling to China (Anyang - the worst polluted city in China by all account) soon for work and I'm a bit concerned that the air quality will be difficult for me to handle. I've been travelling with an air purifier a lot in Europe and the US, but my portable air purifier is 110V (China: 120V) and buying one seems like my only option at the moment. Maybe anyone has been in Anyang recently and might be able to recommend a hotel with an air purifier or give any other advice?"
"I‚Äôve been struggling with a Reactive Airway Disease for 8 months now. My airway is hypersensitive and I‚Äôm constantly clearing my throat, hacking up mucus and I‚Äôve got a persistent cough. 

I‚Äôm 30 and have never had asthma before now. I‚Äôm really struggling - my symptoms are always present although sometimes worse than others. I‚Äôve been taking Breo Ellipta for 2 months now. 1st month 100 mg and now we have bumped it up to 200 mg. 

While the breo is helpful in some ways, I still have a bad cough. My wheezing at night has gotten better but is still present. 

When I clear my throat and have a clear
Breath, I feel a tickle in my throat that makes me want to cough. I‚Äôm feeling hopeless and I just want to feel Healthy again. I‚Äôm aware this new lung disease will not go away but I‚Äôm hoping my symptoms will become under control. 

Anyone out there suffering from occupational asthma, more specifically from an Isocyanate exposure?  If so, have your symptoms gotten better?"


"If I rinse it out, I never dries because of the shape. It also does nothing for the residue inside. Instructions say not to scrub or use paper towel because of static‚Ä¶ I can literally see the powder building up inside. Any tips??"

"Title.

I had some mold issues my landlord neglected at an old home that gave me major asthma flare ups. I‚Äôve had asthma since I was a baby, and never needed treatment to this degree. Went from barely needing albuterol rescue, to using it daily. Went up to Flovent, then to Symbicort, and then Breo. 

Once I moved, things started to get better. Doc and I started to step down from Breo to Flovent, to hopefully nothing. I made it to Flovent before feeling it wasn‚Äôt working as well, especially with exercise induced (which has ALWAYS been a trigger for me). I decided to stay on Breo since it helped the most with exercise, and I am an active person.

Now it‚Äôs allergy season and I‚Äôm feeling pretty asthmatic, it‚Äôs pretty well controlled with Breo and singular, but every once in a while I feel I need my inhaler especially on windy days. 

Ever since that slumlord home, I‚Äôve dealt with these symptoms and I‚Äôve never had this bad of a response to allergy season in my life. Is it possible I‚Äôm just now dependent on these medications to function normally? Has anyone had an experiences being continually exposed to an allergen and then feeling as if their tolerance has been lowered?"
"I think I‚Äôm psyching myself out, but the side of my tongue has been hurting and felt dry for a day or so and I just looked at it - there is white on the sides of my tongue (and only on the sides of my tongue). 

I take Arnuity Ellipta everyday and try very hard to rinse after and brush my teeth. 

1. If this is oral thrush, I can‚Äôt call the doctor until Tuesday. Will I be okay? Is there any over the counter products that work well for you?

2. Is this not thrush and am I freaking out? 

Either way thank you for coming on this journey with me."



"I had my mom pick up some Symbicort inhalers for my kiddo while she was in Mexico.  She got the wrong dosage and got the 160/4.5 instead of the 80/4.5. 

My kid was taking 2 puffs per day, once in the morning then again in the evening. Should I just have him take these once/day, or make the 5hr round trip drive back to Mexico for the correct dosage?"
"i had a lung infection as a kid (microbacterium fortuitum) that was left untreated for a number of years before i went on antibiotics for 4 years. i spent 2 years smoking from 2018-2019 (i had really bad anxiety and smoked cannabis, now i just make edibles) and was put in the hospital for a severe case of rhino enterovirus in late 2019. in 2020 i had a lot of asthma exasperations. i was on incruse and breo inhalers in the morning, levalbuterol as needed, and the occasional 10mg of prednisone as needed. now in 2021 i‚Äôve sworn off breo and prednisone due to fear of cataracts (i was diagnosed with one 4 years ago but now ive been told i don‚Äôt have one lol) and i‚Äôm just on incruse and levalbuterol as needed. it was kind of hard getting off the breo, but with time and exercise i‚Äôve been fine without it. i‚Äôm barely even using my levalbuterol anymore. 

i‚Äôm very happy where i am and i don‚Äôt feel debilitated by my asthma anymore, but my doctor is stuck on my pft readings. i‚Äôm a meek 5‚Äô4‚Äù autistic thing.. does he expect me to have the lung capacity of a 6‚Äô0‚Äù viking?"
" This isn't meant to be an  angry rant or anything (more of an  observation).. I have had acute  asthma all of my life, and I have  family who are severe asthmatics.  Normally you see all of these   charities for cancer awareness months,  trendy ALS bucket challenges,  most everyone talks about diabetes/the  extreme high cost of  insulin..these are all great things to bring  attention to! Don't get me  wrong! But it just seems that asthma is  always the one disease to be  thrown under the bus. While all of those  mentioned diseases are  terrible, let's just not forget how asthmatics  are lacking the one  thing that most people have no problem doing, BEING  ABLE TO BREATHE  AIR! In my 34 years of life, I have just never seen any  kind of major  charities endorsed by celebrities, or a""fight for  asthmatics month"" or  anything of the sort. I'm really not trying to  sound selfish but it  just kind of pisses me off, I think more attention  needs to be brought  to the disease, it completely takes over your life!  The first thing you  have to do when you wake up is do breathing  treatments just to get air  flowing, make sure you take all of your  medicine, and pray you can get  through the day without having an asthma  attack, for those wondering  what it feels like..try breathing through a  drinking straw &amp; see  how long you last. Also like insulin, people  need to realize that  without insurance, our inhalers can rage anywhere  from $500-$1000  dollars, this is just to breathe air like a normal  person! Anyway was  just thinking about this today.  According to online statistics: An  average of 11 Americans will die each day, 40,000 **people**  miss school or work due to asthma each day. 30,000 people have an  asthma attack each day, and 5,000 people visit the emergency room due to  asthma."
"I'm in Australia and the recent extremely chilly weather has caused some asthma symptoms after not having any issues for 20 years. Generally tightness in the throat airways, maybe as I breathe in the cold air

I'm not keen on being on mediation again. I've survived 20years without an inhaler by doing regular exercise. I read about inhaling coconut oil as a natural remedy for asthma but haven't any read studies, directions or even reviews on the method so trying my luck here

Welcome any advice or opinions or recommendations on natural remedies/supplements to help with asthma

Cheers"

"I have moderate asthma but over the last year it has seemed to almost get worse. Not sure if it‚Äôs my apartment or what but every time I fall asleep, I seem to wake up in the middle of night wheezing and need my inhaler. Anyone know why this might be happening? 

I used to rarely need my inhaler and it seems like I‚Äôm using it every day now unfortunately"
"Hi guys

So I recently applied for the Australian Defence Force and I need to get my running skills, technique and endurance up. It requires a 6.5 beep test and a 2.4km run in 13 mins (will try to aim for 11-12mins)

I have suffered from asthma since I was young and I'm generally fine unless I exercise. Something about running, swimming or cycling just aggravates my asthma - during HS, I couldn't jog 200mm without almost fainting so I joined the gym club instead. Therefore, I havent done any endurance type cardio since I was probably 15. Probably because of powerlifting for a few years, my most recent beep test record I did on my own accord was a comfortable 6 (before getting a cramp/my fault for not stretching properly).

Just wondering if anyone can recommend how to practice for the beep test and 2.4km run, especially for people who suffer from exercise-induced asthma and haven't trained in running before. There's quite a bit of info online and on apps but they don't really seem geared towards people with asthma (e.g. recovery days ask for 30min jogs in the first week)

Any advice on training, technique and information is welcome and appreciated. Any recommendations for affordable running shoes will also be appreciated, my Converses probably werent the best to run in

Cheers guys"
I was drunk and someone smoking asked if I wanted some and I stupidly agreed. I had maybe 6 puffs (possibly not even that much) and I'm very worried I may have significantly increased my chances of lung cancer or serious damage.


"I feel like I saw one exists but I havnt looked too much into it. Does it exist? Is it as effective as advair? Cheaper? 

Thanks!"

"To my knowledge I have never had asthma or any issues breathing, I am generally pretty healthy and I exercise regularly. However, there have been maybe 10 times total in my life where I felt it was slightly harder to breathe after going for a run (almost always in the cold of winter), what I thought might be some type of extremely mild asthma, but it was never an issue and I never had it looked at. I have had seasonal allergies every spring for my whole life and I know that can make it more likely to get adult-onset asthma. And during my entire covid and post-covid experience I've had pretty awful allergies throughout (still do right now).

Last month, after a year of not leaving the house unless absolutely necessary, my roommate went out and met a friend and gave me covid a week later. I was devastated but my case was fortunately mild during infection. My lungs seemed to be mostly fine while I had it, but sometimes they would get wheezy and it felt slightly harder to breathe. Ever since, my lungs will be mostly okay for a few days or even a week and I think they're finally getting better (they never feel completely normal though, usually have a mild persistent cough), and then it feels like they are triggered by something and they get very wheezy again and it's hard to breathe for the next few days. It's been worse than it even was when I had covid. And my cough gets worse during those periods. It seems the cough is mostly triggered by exhalation (also it's a dry cough). My doctor prescribed an albuterol inhaler which I see online is pretty much only prescribed for asthma. The inhaler definitely helps me. If it's helping me, does that mean it is probable that I do in fact have asthma now? I will get my lungs tested in a few weeks to find out conclusively if I have asthma but I just wanted to know if you guys had any insights as to whether a virus can suddenly cause adult onset asthma and how likely it actually is that I have asthma. The doctors seemed to think it would likely go away in a few months at most but they also didn't seem 100% confident in that. Thanks :)"
Do you still need to take your regular athma puffer if your using prednisolone?
If you smoke will you get lung cancer?
"My asthma is triggered by weather changes and air pressure shifts. There will be a storm this weekend. It‚Äôs 2 am right now and I‚Äôve been awake since 12. My flare won‚Äôt go away, my chest hurts like hell and I still can‚Äôt breathe comfortably after 4 puffs from my inhaler. I hate this so much, I just want to sleep."
I am new to asthma... I was diagnosed after coming down with being constricted in my breathing from Christmas on.. I had days where it let off and I didn't notice it as much.. then I started noticing a slight wheeze sound if I breathed in deeply. I never had a cough or congestion.. I was showing mild obstruction on my first PFT and then I had two more after that one starting flovent and my last one showed I was at 107% on my FEV1... but at times I still feel my breathing can be off. Just want to know what everyone else feels.
"I landed in the ER this week with a suspected pulmonary embolism.

I rarely suffer from asthma -- was diagnosed with ""exercise-induced asthma"" a few years back after my first asthma attack. Got a rescue inhaler. Used it maybe 5x over 5 years.

Fast-forward to this week. On Monday night, I just Didn't Feel Right. I was lightheaded driving, felt short of breath, fatigue. Walking from the parking lot to my building took about 10 minutes and I needed to take two breaks. Felt disoriented and didn't even think to try my inhaler. Went to bed. Woke up in the morning, dizzy upon standing, out of breath showering. No, this is not right.

Went to my PCP who immediately did an EKG (I guess my symptoms are also women heart attack symptoms), chest xray, blood work. My blood work came back with an elevated ""D Dimer"" which can indicate a blood clot. After 5 missed calls and 2 voicemails from my nurse, I was given instructions to get to an ER stat. My blood work indicated I could have a blood clot.

Wow, they moved in a screaming hurry in the ER! I was hooked up to an EKG before I even had my temperature taken. In less than 3 hours, I had an EKG, blood work, CT scan with contrast. 

Good news: I'm not dying of a pulmonary embolism. That was very scary.

Bad news: I am under orders to stay inside until the air quality is better, as the expected Dx is ""asthma, exacerbated by irritants/pollen."" I feel trapped in my apt. I have a new steroid inhaler to take 2x/day.

Anyone else have this experience? I'm not really an asthma sufferer, usually. But I'm in my late 40s not and understand that adult-onset asthma is more common with older women heading into menopause and supplementing with estrogen."
"I am getting DESTROYED by pollen, I
I‚Äôm a teacher so my weekly agenda right now involves a lot of yard work, jogging and disk golf. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated but not sure if wearing a mask outside might help."

"I hope this is normal in the asthma community, but do y‚Äôall cough and it tastes like mucus ? .. 
I cough regularly and it always comes up with little balls of mucus, and it‚Äôs worse in the morning when I wake up, everything that‚Äôs built up overnight comes up in the first coughs of the day. 
I noticed when I keep myself very hydrated it lessens but any advice or experience with this specific situation?"
"Hey everyone, so I am here because I am completely new to the asthma world.

So I recently got sick from a typical head cold (tested negative for COVID and everyone else who got sick also tested negative). However, I have had an annoying lingering cough that is now going onto almost a month. Normally, I never thought twice about having a lingering cough. It happens. However, it was getting annoying and I decided to follow up with my doctor. 

Whelp, my doctor believes that I likely have underlying asthma that flares up with a cold or allergies. She decided to prescribe me the Flovent preventive inhaler (I think it is a preventive inhaler, definitely not a rescue inhaler). So here I am...completely new to this idea that I may have asthma and honestly, not feeling that great about it. 

My doctor also sent me a referral to do a lung test, so hopefully that will give me a sense of what to really expect. 

As someone new to this, I am seeking advice and guidance. I am still processing this and I am looking for support. The idea of needing to take medication everyday for potentially the rest of my life is very unnerving."
"Everything I read on this says: ""Throw away the inhaler 30 days after removing it from the foil pouch for the first time, when the dose counter displays ""0"", or after the expiration date on the package, whichever comes first.""

Does it really not work that well after 30 days of just being outside of the pouch it came in? I opened mine 15 days ago not realizing this and hadn't started using it until today. Have you guys found it still works effectively after being open past 30 days?"
Do you think a humidifier can function as a nebulizer?
"I‚Äôve been mixing albuterol and budesonide in my nebulizer in order to reduce the amount of time I am sitting in front of the darn thing (they are compatible per https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16678502/).

I have just had ipratropium added to the party, but I cannot find anywhere that says if all three can be co-administered in the nebulizer.

Anyone using all three at once?"
"I have been getting allergy cluster shots to help my out of control asthma and allergies. Two days ago I had a very strong shot dose that I had a mild anaphylactic reaction to and my doc administered an epi shot. My symptoms went away and I just felt jittery, tired and slightly confused the rest of the day. 

Two days later I am just wiped. I feel so exhausted it‚Äôs hard to function. I‚Äôm supposed to go a trip this weekend that I‚Äôve been looking forward to all year and am considering sitting it out bc of how tired I feel. 


Has anyone had an epi shot before an experienced multi-day side effects like this? Everything I have found online makes it sound like I should have been better by the end of that day. 

Thanks in advance!"
"Just for reference I'm only 120 lbs at 5'6"". I'm skinny fat that's it really. 

I notice that I get wheezing/asthma when I sleep at night and it's been affecting my life tremendously. I've tried flonase, zyrtec, alvesco, ventolin, advair, and literally nothing has worked. Is there any hope?

:(. Idk what else to try so if someone can give suggestions. The wheezing is literally the only symptom I get, nothing else."
"I have a question that maybe someone happens to know the answer to... I used to be on Symbicort, which though it was prescribed for 2 doses twice per day, I only used once per day in the evenings and not even every day if my asthma symptoms weren't acting up at all. This worked for me, never had issues. Now insurance won't cover Symbicort, and I got switched to an Advair diskus. I'm honestly anxious about being on a new medication, since Symbicort worked so well for me with no side effects. For the Advair, I'm prescribed for 1 puff every 12 hours. Generally speaking I prefer to take the least amount of any medication possible. If I only use the Advair once per day, half as much as instructed, does that render it ineffective? Or just LESS effective? Also, if you use/have used Advair diskus, what side effects have you experienced? Do you like it, feel like it works well, etc.?"
"This is for a 28 year old female complaining of only shortness of breath and slight wheeze here and there when breathing in. I just woke up on Christmas not being able to breathe good. This happened after a major GERD attack that lasted me 2 weeks before this and I had what felt like battery acid in my throat for that entire time. My GI doctor said GERD can't cause shortness of breath and so forth so I am confused. I was put on flovent after this and I reversed to 89% 3 weeks after and now on 5/12 I effortlessly blew to 107%! My concern is, could this still be COPD? I did smoke for a good bit but have stopped now. I am not trying to replace a doctor, but just wanted to see if anyone has experienced the same or roughly? I didn't think asthma can cause a restriction on breathing 24/7.. It was like a air hunger more than being out of breath.. I could still do fine and honestly walking made my breathing seem better when I wasn't able to breathe good. Sitting and laying down made it worse then when I dwelled on it, it also made it worse. Out of all this I am glad to say it DID help me to stop smoking for sure.. but scared I have messed up my lungs. I know that IS the consequences of smoking and I feel ashamed now. Just wanted some input I am not sure.. my Respiratory Therapist made it seem like asthma since I reversed so well.. but she also acts like she doesn't know why my breathing was constantly constricted before flovent.. Just trying to understand or catch a similarity in anyone else. Thank you for your time."
Has anyone experienced asthma relief with weight loss?
"Hi all. I‚Äôm writing this to hopefully get some advice on what to do and to see if how I‚Äôm feeling is normal. So for context, I was diagnosed with mild asthma about a year and 3 or so months ago. I was prescribed albuterol for it and was supposed to take it as needed. Over summer break I needed it a few times but not much. Never more than twice a week. Well I started running last summer and after that I barely ever needed it. I was overweight and I lost some of that weight and my breathing felt a lot better in general. Well over the last few days I feel like it‚Äôs come back and was hoping to see what might be triggering it and how much of it is just anxiety. I don‚Äôt know if I have allergies or what but I‚Äôve had a scratchy throat and some congestion and post nasal drip the past few days. It could‚Äôve been from where it‚Äôs been so hot where I live. And I also went into the woods yesterday to walk with my girlfriend and that probably didn‚Äôt help matters. Well today I still had the scratchy throat and it turned into it being slightly harder to breathe in more and a cough. And I‚Äôve had my Covid vaccine so I doubt it‚Äôs that so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs allergies. I used my oximeter and it was jumping between 96 and 98 depending on the finger and I did my peak flow meter and it was around 550 which is normal I guess. I don‚Äôt know anything about the numbers other than what I‚Äôve looked up and it says it‚Äôs in the normal range. I still used my inhaler to see if it would help and it has some. I can take deeper breaths now. It kinda gives me the shakes though and it makes me a bit more anxious. But now Ive gotten more anxious because I‚Äôve tried to manually take deeper breaths and sometimes it feels like I can‚Äôt get a deep breath in. I saw someone else on this sub talking about how they do that anxiously. I have pretty severe anxiety and health anxiety is what makes it worse. So can someone give me some advice or convince me that my breathing is as normal as it can be? Would summer allergies cause what I‚Äôm feeling? I just keep getting anxious and I feel like having asthma makes it worse as I keep panicking that my lungs will stop working. Thanks for any help"

"I reported the incident to multiple elected officials' offices, including the mayor's office, last Friday. And thank you for the supportive community here at r/Asthma. I really appreciate you all. (I get attacked so bad in several Canada local communities here on Reddit for 'trying to impose my preferences (of mask-wearing) on others'. 

Anyway, I have received a response from my local public health unit's inspector. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r8mgo5zlzi171.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10e744eaef61f10ecb8dc4f2dbcb1e258b2192a4

I'm glad at least an inspection is done and that Public Health would keep me up-to-date on the issue. 

However, it is sad that public health agencies across Canada still have NOT updated its public health guidelines following increasing evidence that airborne instead of drop-let is the main mode of transmission. This means that physical barrier in indoor, less-than-ideal ventilation condition, is rather useless in preventing transmission, as the virus can linger in the air. 

But to those negative people, who say I shouldn't do anything and just mind my own business, my response is: I'm trying to get the company to do the right thing to protect the 'medically exempt' employees and the customers. And what harm could I possibly do to others with a public health inspection of a major grocery chain?"
"so just wondering some things.

&amp;#x200B;

Can exersising on a filthy rug that hasnt been cleaned cause a bhroncial spasm? Like so much stuff that I could notice a difference visually in the carpet after sweeping it vigourusly with a corn broom.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I am on symbicort and since my wheezing episodes have changed from being plemy to not being plehmy it sounds different... like to the point its hard to recognize so its hard to know when I need my rescue puffer.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, how do I know I should use my rescue puffer in the morning before I use my symbicort?"

I live in NJ and I am just... at a loss for what to do. My allergies and subsequently my asthma are just getting worse and worse. I‚Äôm considering a two week trip to AZ just to see if I get relief. Has anyone moved or traveled away in bad seasons?
" Bear with me as I am new to this asthma journey and meds. I have Graves  disease which is a endocrin matter and I was just diagnosed with asthma  as well. I am concerned about the affects of corticosteroids and already  having Graves, will this mess with my cortisol more than the average  person without Graves. I am not sure if there are any Endo's on here,  but it would be nice to get a peace of mind. I was prescribed flovent  and have noticed some rather mean side effects creeping on the more I  take it. I am also having some night sweats as well.. .is this all from  the flovent possibly? I am experiencing agitation more than usual and  blurry vision and urinating more as well. TMI I am so sorry. I was  concerned could this cause me to develop Addison's since I already have  the existing Graves (thyroid is in range for now)? I am just feeling so  off since I started the corticosteroid and I seem to be sensitive to  most meds. The flovent is the only thing that has changed for me and I  did get my thyroid checked in case all this was that, but it was normal  as of 5/11. Any help would be nice and appreciated!"
"Our dog chewed my wife's Dulera inhaler last night. The canister inside was not punctured, and seems like it will still function. The blue plastic housing is completely destroyed, making the intact canister useless. Are there any options to replace this plastic so she can continue using the canister? 

[CVS](https://www.cvs.com/shop/primatene-mist-epinephrine-inhalation-aerosol-0-125mg-per-spray-prodid-2230142) and [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/primatene-mist-epinephrine-inhalation-aerosol-160-metered-sprays/ID=prod6393228-product) sell a relatively cheap OTC inhaler, so I was considering buying that just to take the housing from it. I'm just not sure if that will work or not."
I‚Äôve been an asthmatic my whole life (I‚Äôm 25) and I haven‚Äôt used maintence inhalers since I was a kid. I wasn‚Äôt even using my rescue inhaler for years and I‚Äôm a runner. I went to my doctor because I only have a few more months with the good insurance I have now. I hadn‚Äôt gone in years because my symptoms were under control. Apparently my FeNO test was 73 and she prescribed me fluticisone. I‚Äôve been taking it for not even two weeks and I‚Äôve had horrible mood swings and insomnia. I have mental health issues to begin with and I‚Äôm on a bunch of meds for it. I‚Äôve decided I will take my albuterol before my run but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable taking my maintenance inhaler especially since I feel fine and haven‚Äôt had an asthma attack. It doesn‚Äôt feel worth it. Can I just stop cold turkey since it‚Äôs been such a short amount of time? I really feel so mentally unstable and there‚Äôs nothing else it could be. When I was younger my mom said some medications made me angry but I can‚Äôt remember what meds it was. I also live in a city and plan to stay so I think that‚Äôs why my FeNO was 73...
"I've done nebulizer treatments in the hospital many times; they have been the only thing to help when it's gotten really bad. I just got 2 nebulizers so I can start doing them at home. I have albuterol, saline, and Asthmanephrine. I've done a few treatments on my own, very mild success, but about an hour ago I did one (albuterol) and halfway through had to stop because I was wheezing so bad. My breathing is still significantly more labored now than than was before the treatment, I am still wheezing so much. Help???"
"Hey everyone! So I am fairly new to asthma. I had my first real attack this week, and it was not so fun. I have been on 60 mg of prednisone, Advair, albuterol, nose sprays(xhance, etc) allergy meds. everything you can imagine. My doctor is switching me to trilegy for my maintenance inhaler. Any good or bad reviews?"
Ive had a rediculous amount of x rays in the past 3 years. Like about 25 or more not counting dental x rays and 5 CT scans 1 vq scan. Really concerned about cancer risk. I spent so much time chasing down what could be causing my breathing issues which landed me in the hospital way too many times. That in addition to severe hypochondria. Im gonna die of cancer arent I :(
Changing insurance and Breo isn‚Äôt covered.  Has anyone changed from Breo to Symbocort or Dulera and been successful as far as symptom management goes?   Just curious before my doc appointment next month.

"Hey,

Like title says - I have, for the most part, gotten my asthma under control. Usually it only pops up when I am sick (I get a flu, cold) and in those cases I do use my rescue inhaler. I recently was talking to a colleague about my asthma and was told it would be a good idea to start using my preventative inhaler. I have a prescription for one that I need to refill, but I am somewhat skeptical of the idea of being dependent on a preventative inhaler when my asthma isn't usually bad unless I get sick.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, any suggestions or comments would be extremely helpful. Thanks!"
"Hi, so I'm on Fostair 200/6 (2 puffs twice a day) up from 100/6 (2 puffs twice a day). When I was on 100/6 I used it as a MART inhaler as directed by my Asthma Nurse. However, because I changed dosage I've now read that I shouldn't use it as a MART inhaler if the dose is 200/6. However my GP said to continue to use it as a MART inhaler but only an additional 2 times a day (if needed), not 4 like before. Is this normal? I'm planning to contact my Asthma Nurse about it too.

(Hope this makes sense and wasn't too difficult to follow, lol)."

"Went to the pulmonologist for the first time a few weeks ago. My first ENO 212. Went back 2 weeks later and it was 280.  That was with me on Spiriva, Singulair, predisone and Symbicort. Anybody seen any numbers higher than that."

"I was diagnosed as a mild asthmatic in 2017 and prescribed a rescue inhaler and a daily Flovent discus inhaler. I rarely need the rescue inhaler, so when I take it as prescribed (2 puffs) the albuterol always makes me shake so much I can‚Äôt hold anything steady. Because I have anxiety disorders, it also increases my anxiety. Does this happen to anyone else?"
"My asthma is now very well controlled. I'm thinking of quitting inhalers from tomorrow and never taking it. 

If I do that, will the symptoms like inflammation of airways and construction along with cough return? If it returns, in how much time will it return?

Or I am cured and it will never return? 

My inhaler is very expensive and I'm losing health coverage at the end of this month"
"According to my doc, I have been suffering from allergy induced asthma and was given albuterol as a rescue inhaler, symbicort for maintenance 4x daily, and singulair 1x daily. I have done this for the past 12 weeks. I recently began taking Wellbutrin for anxiety/depression and take it 2x daily. It‚Äôs been about 3 weeks, and I‚Äôve felt like my asthma medication is just not working as effectively. My attacks are more frequent, my coughing is back with a vengeance, and I‚Äôm feeling that deflating balloon feeling on my exhale when I‚Äôm trying to speak a simple sentence. Could the Wellbutrin be counteracting my asthma meds?

For perspective, I‚Äôm mid-30s, generally healthy. I live in Houston, TX, the humidity is god awful high right now, and the trees are still bursting with pollen."

"This battle of wills with my insurance company started in August of 2020. I have eosinophilic asthma, I need a biologic shot to get it under control.

"Just wondering if anyone has had asthma that never goes away. Last year in the beginning of July I had an asthma flare up that was horrible for months, (could barely walk, steaming 9 times a day along with nebulizer just to breathe enough) and almost a year later, I may not be as bad, but every day since is still a struggle. I'm on Singulair and Trelegy now, and it does help, but I still go back and forth with good days and bad days. Most of the time I have to sit with my knees bent just to feel like I can breathe somewhat properly. I've been through so many treatments, and would just like to know if anyone else has experienced asthma that is present every single day, to the point where things like working out are impossible?"

Right now my only option is albuterol every four hours. It helps, but just to keep me alive basically. My activities have become extremely limited. Can't stand or walk for over a few minutes. Wheezing all night is so loud that it keeps me awake.

Does anyone have any ideas here? Thanks."
"Hello everyone,
Two years ago I got diagnosed with exercise induced asthma and had QVAR and Albuterol prescribed to me. As time passed the asthma seemingly went away and I essentially forgot about it. Lately I have been extremely stressed and have a tightened feeling in my chest (and some mucus) making it a bit harder to breathe but nothing crazy. I don‚Äôt have any wheezing or cough at the moment. Yesterday I decided to take a puff of QVAR and felt relief in terms of breathing after like 20-30 mins. My doctor two years ago told be to take a single puff twice a day so I followed the same rules.

I thought this would be a one and done thing so I didn‚Äôt take another dose after I woke up, but today I had another slight discomfort after exercising showing some signs of ‚Äúchest tightness/shortness of breath‚Äùand mucus. I decided to take QVAR again because of this. Right now my chest is slightly tight but is getting more relaxed as time is passing. I don‚Äôt have pain when breathing, but mostly slight discomfort. I‚Äôm pretty anxious as of now since this feels kind of out of the blue for me. My dad has a similar asthma condition (he feels slight congestion due to allergies) and has told me not to take the Albuterol since that is for emergencies. Is there anything I should be wary of because of this sudden flare up? When should I take Albuterol since I never really used it before?
Sorry for the long lost and thank you for reading."
I have allergic asthma and now GERD. My asthma is well controlled. I have heartburns from GERD and currently take Famotidine.

I‚Äôve just been given a brown inhaler (Clenil Modulite) by my doctor. I took it for the first time tonight and didn‚Äôt expect it to come out that harsh so obviously I panicked and couldn‚Äôt hold it in for the 10 seconds. Now this is where my anxiety kicks in and can‚Äôt remember if I swallowed the air from it or breathed out. If I was to swallow the air from it would this be fine and safe ? Just nervous and worried thanks

"Hey community üëãüèº I wanted to just inquire if anyone here on this sub has experienced similar symptoms to mine after having had used Advair HFA (not the diskus) for a while. I‚Äôve been using a high dose of Advair (230/21, 4 puffs a day) for the last ~3 months. Although it‚Äôs been controlling my asthma pretty well, I‚Äôve been noticing some side effects. Firstly, I‚Äôve been getting a lot of muscle cramps and muscle weakness at times too. The cramps have been mostly in my feet, but other places at times too. I know that it could obviously be do to other things as well, but this has only started after using Advair for a few months now because it rarely ever happened before. My acne has been strong; although this could also be due to other things, I‚Äôm pretty sure that this inhaler isn‚Äôt helping either. At times I do notice hoarseness in my voice after use, but I‚Äôve cut this down a lot by rinsing my throat with a full cup of warm water every time. Other than that, I haven‚Äôt noticed much else other than insomnia if I forget and take it late, and some increased irritability (again, could be due to other things LOL). Anyone else noticed similar things? Was it worth stopping for you or at least minimizing the dosage? The thought of not being able to breathe again with a Lowe dose or switching meds is too scary for me ‚òπÔ∏è"

"So I currently live in Wisconsin, but I‚Äôve always had problems with asthma my whole life. I also have problems with allergies, and because of the two I‚Äôm thinking of switching states. On top of that I have cerebral palsy and can‚Äôt move around well in snow, so an area that gets a lot of snow like Wisconsin doesn‚Äôt work that well for me. Extreme heat like Florida in the summer does not work well for me either. 

I am thinking of eventually moving in to one of the Carolinas after taking a trip to the Blue Ridge Mountains in 2019 and having my asthma and allergy symptoms basically disappear. I also had a similar thing happened in the warmer areas of Arizona, but I would probably have to be a snowbird if I did that because I couldn‚Äôt take the summer heat. I also can‚Äôt drive, so wherever I lived would be in a city. 

So, have any of you moved to a different state because of asthma or even another health condition? What were your experiences?"
I just left my appointment with an allergist/ asthma specialist and I‚Äôm a little confused.. he ran a few breathing tests and said there wasn‚Äôt evidence showing I have asthma and that would explain why the inhaler they gave me hasn‚Äôt been helping. They ran an allergy panel and allergy shot test showing I was allergic to cats and dogs and some grasses/ pine. I started showing tightness in my chest and trouble breathing like taking a full breath comfortably and labored breathing a little over a month ago. I have lived with my dogs for over 5 years with no allergy symptoms and my breathing difficulties and cough started a month ago out of the blue. I stopped working out completely a month ago when this started to take it easy until I met with a professional. He said it could be exercise induced asthma and gave me a prescription for a new inhaler to start using before my work outs. I‚Äôm just confused because I haven‚Äôt worked out at all since this started because I haven‚Äôt been feeling well so I‚Äôm confused how it would be exercise induced. He said I should start working out again and use the inhaler and we will move from there a month from now. He suggested allergy shots later on if I don‚Äôt feel better in a month but I‚Äôm not sure if I should try to get a second opinion from a different allergy specialist or a pulmonologist. I guess I was hoping I could get some answers sooner than that because I have been feeling really shitty and was hoping I could get an allergy medication or at least a more clear understanding of what‚Äôs going on. When this started I was tested for Covid and it was negative. He said it could be GERD or vocal cord dysfunction but that he thinks it‚Äôs exercise induced asthma. Does anyone have a similar situation or any advice on how to move forward? Thank you
"Does anyone else use Albuterol as needed with exercise on top of advair?

I requested a refill for my albuterol from a new doctor and I‚Äôm going through 20 questions now as to why I need it if I am on advair (I use the 500 one just 1x day)"

Was a rough asthma day from the get-go and I probably should have rescheduled. It‚Äôs gotten significantly worse after I donated. On Advair and had to use rescue inhaler four times already and it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs really helping. This a normal thing? Cant find anything on the internet. Haven‚Äôt donated blood in years! It‚Äôs just super annoying.
"So I have been having shortness of breath (no it's not covid btw I got tested)! Like I feel like I can't get a full proper breath that my brain feels satisfied with. I also suffer from anxiety disorders like OCD, GAD and panic attacks. Idk what this stems from I went to the ER this morning because the shortness of breath caused a full blown panic attack. I got tested and XRays and everything came back good. I feel like my brain isn't getting enough oxygen but my oxygen levels were at like 99% when they check it. So what I'm trying to say is what's a common indicator of asthma like what is your experience with it? Because I have had this same problem like a few months back and it last for like a week or 2 and then I can breath normally. Also when you take a benzo does it take away symptoms from asthma? Because I find when I take a benzo everything goes back to normal!"
"It recently turned out my lifelong constant allergies were in fact ***not*** allergies, and I'm now supposed to use an Albuterol inhaler every four hours, but it clearly wasn't designed with the intent of being kept in your pocket lol. Does anyone have any creative ways to keep it on you without having to carry around a case in hand?"
"i‚Äôm 29 year old woman having to wear a pad cause my asthma has been making me pee myself. 

i get bad bouts now and then and when it‚Äôs bad i can‚Äôt stop coughing and i wet myself

i love wearing pajamas with no underwear cause it‚Äôs more comfy but can‚Äôt like this my pants are soaked within like 20 mins 

it‚Äôs the worst omg i can barely walk without coughing and sleeping is so hard. i‚Äôve been through this before and i hate it i hate feeling like a elderly woman man it‚Äôs scary to think one day i‚Äôll die from this in my old age ughh"

"For the past week or so, I have been having a lot of nasal inflammation. I initially assumed it was allergies or sinus pressure, but I have tried sudafed, claritin, ibuprofen and mucinex and nothing seems to be helping. I have tried flonase for the past few days and it also hasn't helped. It feels like there is constant pressure on the bridge of my nose, and air feels warm when I inhale (even though I'm not in a hot/stuffy environment). I have had chest pressure/tightness lasting for weeks that's not painful, and doctors initially thought it was costochondritis, but they can't reproduce the pain so they are unsure. Blood tests/x ray/EKG have been done to rule out blood clots and heart problems since I was vaccinated a few weeks ago. My throat sometimes feels uncomfortable when breathing. 

My dad also had adult onset asthma. Was just wondering if this sounds like it so I can make an appointment to maybe get tested? I've been to the doctor repeatedly these past few weeks but have gotten no answers, but no one has thought to test for asthma."

"x-posted in r/urticaria

We're considering enrolling our kiddo (3 yo) in a trial at a leading hospital that uses Xolair with immunotherapy for food allergies. If we're randomized into the treatment arm, they would give monthly injections for 2 years. Of course Xolair is not approved for kids under 6, but they're hoping to show enhanced immunotherapy outcomes as well as possibly preventing future allergic disease (asthma, seasonal allergies, other atopic disease) by modulating the immune system at this young age. 

We're excited about the possibility but considering her food allergies are manageable right now and she doesn't yet have the other allergic diseases (too young to develop them), we're not sure if there are bad risks with Xolair at this age. Thanks for any advice or opinions. We have of course spoken to her doc but wondering about the experience of actual users. Thanks!"

"So I'm some how very dumb when it comes to my pulmicort despite it being the reason I can walk and breath. 

I'm undiagnosed anything, I have weird ideopathic anaphylaxis + SOB &amp; fevers &amp; tachycardia at rest without this puffer. It's allowed me to walk up to 2.4 km/day.

I washed it, with water under the sink and I've fucked it up. I can't taste it anymore. I did a gentle wash just the tip, avoided the hole... but I must've got water in it. I've been able to taste it before and it's a new puffer.

If there anyway to fix it or is this my $95 mistake?"
"Fucking lol, hacking and wheezing with that shit in my mouth and getting spit all over it was so awful, especially during peak spring. Why do people make stuff up?"
"I came down with pneumonia last three weeks ago and just recovered, but they gave me too many inhalers and now that im off them i find my teeth super sentitive even with numbing toothpastes and pain killers, specially the front ones.
Is this normal?? Can it be fixed??"
"My allergist just took me off Zyrtec since all my symptoms disappeared after beginning Dupixent 6 months ago for asthma &amp; nasal polyps with chronic sinusitis. I still take Singulair &amp; Flonase, but man, the past week has been ROUGH! I've been taking antihistamines for 15 to 20 years and allergy shots for 5 years. Worst allergies I've dealt with in a long time. I want to tough through it but are there any downside to taking antihistamines other than long-term dependency? Wondering why my allergist told me to discontinue it."

I usually pay around $30 to $40 dollars for my Flovent. I noticed the other day the total cost (with insurance) came to $105. Is anyone else seeing a cost increase in their medication? Or maybe I‚Äôm just the only one??
"For the past few days, I am coughing every few minutes :(

I've never had symptoms like this before, now all of a sudden I am having these symptoms

I was never diagnosed with asthma btw and idk if I have it. Years before this my problems were that I would cough after running a mile or drinking some ice drink. but I never experienced anything like this. I am afraid I will get an asthma attack and not have an inhaler :(."
"Hi. Does anyone know when this actually kicks in, I‚Äôve been on this 3 weeks now and can honestly say I don‚Äôt feel any different. I was taken off of Trimbow and put on this and fast air. Not feeling any better at all.

"Hey y'all,

So I'm a long time asthmatic and have been pretty bad for most of my life. (I'm 26m) for many years I had been using Symbicort thinking that it was the best I could do. Last Christmas I got Covid and it messed me up real bad. I almost was hospitalized and was using 2-3 nebulizers a day just to keep my oxygen in the low 90s. Well after I recovered, my asthma seemed to still be pretty bad. I typically will blow through an Albuterol rescue inhaler about every 1-1.5 months. That rate was doubled in the immediate month following covid. I talked to my doc about it and he recommended that I try a long acting inhaler called Trelegy Elliott.

 Well I've been on it since February and I have all but stopped needing to use my rescue inhaler...I can't tell y'all how much of a relief it's been to not be dependent on it....it's life changing. Not sure if it will be this good for everyone but its definitely worth a shot if you are up for trying something new."
"I got diagnosed with Asthma last year. I thought that I was having shortness of breath from potentially inhaling a piece of wood when eating a smore. Bronchoscopy came back clear so that was ruled out. Doctors started me on Singulair and Symbicort. I would say that it helps me control it but I feel like even with the medicine I still have a somewhat constant pressure in my chest. Some days are worse than others and today is one of the bad days. It's just so annoying that I went from perfectly healthy to hocking up mucus all day. I'll shortly be moving back to America where my medicine is going to cost a shit load of money. I guess i'm just feeling a little frustrated with the situation. I'm sure that my symptoms will cool down but I'm just fucking sick of it at times.   


Thanks for listening to my rant. I hope yall have a nice day."
"Hello everyone, been following this reddit for a long time and been trying to muster up the right words without making it the longest read but I'll try to keep as many details as I can and am open for private messages for any questions...so lets get on it with it.

I'll start with my current issues, I'm a tad bit overweight now (30lbs) muscular build, but could def shed a few #'s in the belly, I'm 100% sure this attributes to more severe flare ups during exercise. I was more healthy pre covid and actively at a gym and doing a lot better keeping my asthma under control but always had my albuterol. I really can only blame myself for my body condition, but I think we've all went through funks of depression where motivation is absolutely stagnant or even finding a girlfriend or boyfriend where you get comfortable with each, have a passion for food rather than exercise, lol. Whether it be a new job your putting a lot of time into making time for exercise can be difficult in life.

Now lets rewind two decades back when I was a child getting nebulizer treatments in elementary schools and felt like the bubble boy. My allergist pricked my arm with various substances and there wasn't one thing I wasn't allergic to that I'd still say the majority of the population around me are more affected by; pollon, ragweed, dander, dust mites, you name it. I felt like I was mentally brainwashed to think I'd be some ""weaker"" person my whole life. At this time in my life I was on Ventolin and Intal(sp?), if I recall correctly. The attacks were scary but manageable, sometimes I could power through them with deep breathing and meditation but scary none the less.

Fast forward to High School I'm now I'm playing football, tennis, baseball etc., constant activity and exercise definitely helped build up my lung strength, I still had a rescue inhaler but also on Advair daily preventative, I can't recall how well I took it everyday but I tried my best as a young adolescent, eventually I just stopped using it because the powder stuff just tasted gross in my throat. Like I said, I was told I was allergic to everything, including cats and dogs, I still am definitely bothered my cats, (scratchy throat/itchy eyes) but when It came to sleepovers at friends houses with pets I kind of just powered through them and tried building a tolerance which brings up my biggest point of my post. I think as all asthmatics we need to expose ourselves to things that might upset us, I'm currently a golf course Superintendent and I was told I was allergic to grass, I don't take any allergy medicine in the Spring time which I think is amazing compared to friends I have that don't even have asthma, now I know allergies and asthma are totally different things, but to I'm still proof that I conquered what I was once told would debilitate me.

I'm no doctor but I think the less medication we can take and build up our natural immunity to things is a wise decision. Winters &amp; cold air still upset me and I will always need that inhaler by my side, but many times I try to take deep breaths and control my flareups without needing the crutch that is my inhaler. I'd say my asthma has been very under control since being on the nebulizer treatments as a child and only needing albuterol as a backup, but I also asked my doctor about a preventative that I really will recommend to everyone which was Symbicort. During the Winter when I was active/ snowboarding and again overweight and a little out of shape I would use my Albuterol at least 10 times a day which I definitely do not recommend, it is also generic so I think it really doesn't have as much punch as a true Ventolin.

Finally I just want to say this disease really sucks and I never would wish it on anyone and everyone's experiences will vary, but I just wanted to tell you my experience in the shortest way possible and try to urge you to be careful and have your medicine but use it as a last resort, try meditation and deep breathing, its not fun and may take over 10 minutes to control an attack, but one day you might not have your inhaler in your pocket so practicing other techniques and exposing yourself to things you were told you need to avoid may actually make you more resilient. Humans have an amazing away of adapting to the dangers we face in this world, I know like many of you wish to be fully off any medicine and I hope maybe they cant mutate our DNA and do that..one day, but until now, be strong, be a fighter, and try to find ways to fight this disease before reaching for that inhaler, like I mentioned before I'm overweight at least 30lbs and I know that isn't helping to control my current condition. To this day I'm a lot better around peoples pets, but oddly my aunt and uncles shiatzus which are hypoallergenic have bothered my throat and eyes...weird I know. I work outside everyday on the golf course and breath clean fresh air that I'm sure is full of allergens, but somehow I conquered them. 

Be a fighter and excuse any grammar errors."
"I usually able to blow 600-650 when I can breath clearly.

Lately, I have been just about managed 400 to 300.
I read online that I should check by doing a reading before taking medication and then doing another reading 20 mins after and then my breathing returns back to 600-650.

After maybe an hour or two, my breathing returns back to 400-300

Is that bad?"
"I do symbicort 2 puffs twice a day for allergic asthma 
There was a fire today in my area that triggered an attack. I had to take albuterol for it about an hour ago. 

I usually take my symbicort about an hour from now.

Do I wait longer? Or do I even take the symbicort? I would ask my doctor but they're closed."
I have been given a ventolin inhaler for when I get shortness of breath. I tried to use it but it did not help. Am I able to take it again ? Or do I have to wait ?

"I've had a tight chest and occasional wheezing for the last couple of months: not constant but for much of the day. Other symptoms are thick mucous at the back of my throat and sometimes a stuffy nose. My doctor isn't seeing patients in person but gave me a phone consultation - she said it was probably allergies and advised me to take Claritin and Beconase. They don't seem to be making any difference, though. Could it be asthma? Do the symptoms fit?"
"Hey all! A couple months ago, out of the blue, I started having shortness of breath. The only other time this has happened was last year for about a week when I was deployed (couldn‚Äôt get tested for COVID, but have since been vaccinated). I‚Äôm a fit 28yo male, smoked cigs a long time ago but quit in 2015, then smoked on deployment. The weekend before my symptoms began, I smoked a cig for the first time in a year, and I started running outside as winter turned to spring. I haven‚Äôt smoked since.

Anyway, after a couple days, the Military docs told me it sounded like asthma so they prescribed me an Albuterol rescue. I went to the ER the next day because I had trouble breathing and I was experiencing nervousness/HR increases (found out that was a side effect so I‚Äôve since been given symbicort). The ER doc looked at a chest X-ray and my EKG, told me I‚Äôm perfectly fine in those areas, and told me I have reactive airway disease and I need to see a specialist‚Äîso fast forward to now.

My current doctor through the VA has been awesome and all my blood tests have come back fine. He says my asthma is atypical because I don‚Äôt have too bad of a wheeze, and virtually no cough, but I still have SOB. He says not to be too concerned because I can still workout fine etc., but it still a bit odd to me that all the sudden I may have triggered some sort of asthma. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this? I see the pulmonologist next month, and if they tell me it‚Äôs not asthma, should I be frightened given my symptoms? This is all quite odd to me!

TL;DR: Awaiting diagnoses out of nowhere as a pretty healthy adult. Seems strange that this would happen and am seeking input from others experiences to help make sense of this all."
"I've just been diagnosed with asthma, and been given a peak flow meter, I'm recording 820 to 860, is this normal? This is also before any inhalers. From what I've seen this is a very high reading, what can be inferred from this reading?"

"I‚Äôm waiting for the results of my lung function test (it‚Äôs been 7 days now, and I was told within 7, so I‚Äôll call my doctor tomorrow) but I‚Äôve just had what I‚Äôm going to call an asthma attack. I was sitting on the bus and the air conditioning was on (it‚Äôs no more than 15¬∞c today!) and I could feel my breathing getting worse, used Ventolin, and tried to not panic I guess. I got off the bus, and walked up some stairs where there were people trying to get donations for some charity and I could barely get the words out to say I couldn‚Äôt stop before I started crying because I could barely breathe. I‚Äôm ok now, but I feel cold on the inside even though I‚Äôm sitting in the library where the heating is on. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to warm up the air I‚Äôm breathing a bit so it doesn‚Äôt feel so uncomfortable?? 

TLDR - I need to make the air I‚Äôm breathing warmer. Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance!"
Hey all. My friends and I are all graduating and planning on hanging out and getting some weed to just chill out and I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with smoking pot with asthma. I‚Äôve heard different stories with some not having any issues and some not being able to get near it.
So I can‚Äôt get a new inhaler right now and the one I‚Äôm using has expired and I feel like I need it throughout the day is it ok if I use it after I workout? Like would any affects come from it?
"I am sorry to come on this sub and ask a question that has probably been asked a million times but I need some advice on what to do.

From time to time I can‚Äôt really put my finger on a trigger if I had to guess maybe it would be temperature change and allergens but I get the following symptoms: my throat feels like it‚Äôs closing and gets dry, a lot of mucus in my throat which may or may not be post nasal I can‚Äôt really tell, and lastly short of breathe. When I say short of breathe it‚Äôs not so much I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe it‚Äôs more so that I just feel like I‚Äôm not getting a satisfying breathe. Is this asthma? I also have very bad anxiety and acid issues.

I have been to an allergist and an inhaler did absolutely nothing to improve my spirometer test."
"This is meant to be a post that encourages multiple perspectives and interpretations. I help to run a club for chronically ill and/or disabled students at my school, and was wondering how people with Asthma classify themselves.

I've read some very interesting studies on severe Asthma and its effects on daily functioning, where people in the study as well as the study authors themselves categorize severe Asthma as a disability. Mild Asthma seems to, more often, be recognized as a chronic illness or disease. 

Do you feel like you personally identify with one of these labels? Both? None? Something different entirely? Does this distinction depend on how your Asthma is categorized, or by how it affects you? Does this distinction impact you or change anything about your relationship with the world?

I know-really 'deep' question. But I am genuinely curious about how Asthmatics would consider themselves. As a person with Severe Asthma which only developed around three years ago, I am struck by the stark contrast between my life before and after diagnosis, yet I feel that I'm uncertain about labelling myself ""as"" anything. But I don't think labels are a requirement, especially if they do nothing for you. So I suppose I feel confused, and am looking for what other people think about this topic."
"Hi everyone,

I've been on Dupixent since December I think and I've just had pretty much my first side effect that I couldn't treat on my own. I had a few small red bumps on my skin near the injection site, like hives (so somewhat alarming at first), but they didn't itch or seem to resolve after taking extra antihistamines. I sent a picture to my doctor, who assured me this was normal and nothing to worry about. However, I haven't read or seen anyone else express a similar issue, and my doctor didn't tell me what they were.

Now that I've been thinking, I realize that Dupixent is a relatively new drug and I'm pretty sure side effects are being discovered all the time. Has anyone else had a similar side effect experience, or learned of another side effect just through getting it after taking Dupixent?"
"For my whole life I've had these random moments where it feels like my throat suddenly closes up, dries out completely, &amp; I cant breathe. Like I'm madly gasping for air, choking, panicking, &amp; coughing loads, &amp; feel like I may literally die. It's like some super dramatic choking scene from a soap opera or something.

Is this what an asthma attack is?

Ik it's silly but I've always just brushed it off thinking it happens to everyone &amp; that 'my throat was just dry'

I also always feel like I've got mucus in my throat &amp; have a permanent cough trying to shift it. Is that asthma too?

Thank you for reading hope you can share some advice! ‚ò∫üíï"

"So, I have been diagnosed with allergic asthma about 2 months back and have been put on montelukast and daily inhalers for about 2 months. 
This diagnosis was after my SPO2 was observed to be fluctuating and dropping to 93 a few times while I went for diagnosis of some other issue.

It's almost been a year of these fluctuations and the pattern is 93-94 everytime when I start measuring my SPO2 (normal breathing while sitting or lying down) and in a minute or so it goes to 95 everytime (sometimes 96). 
If I deep breathe 2-3 times or work out a little or any form of physical activity it rises to 97-98.

Almost 4 doctors have not shown any concerns on this pattern but I keep wondering why does it drop to 93 when sitting and breathing normally and does it happen for others with asthma?

By the way, the first doctor diagnosed the issue as COPD, 2nd doc as bronchitis and 3rd doc as allergic asthma ! 

IGE levels were high and there is some family history of asthma, so probably the 3rd diagnosis is right."
"About 2 weeks ago I started having a nasty post nasal drip that led to really hard coughing. Last week I lost my voice enirely and am only starting to get it back. I've used my inhalers, mucinex, decongestant spray (only occassionally), seasonal allergy meds and was even prescribed a cough medicine by an urgicare clinic but none of that worked  (my regular doctors won't see someone in person with a cough due to covid even though I've been vaccinated since February, which is a  MORONIC policy). I finally got an  in person appt. with my asthma doc on tuesday but this post nasal drip is  neverending. Anyone ever experience this kind of thing? I always get terrible colds that last for weeks so that might be all this is but frankly I'm scared this won't go away."
"I live in India with very rare access to vaccines. I have booked an appointment for my mother \[45F\] for tomorrow and I can't reach any doctor for this so late in night, so I need something to assure myself if I am not doing anything very wrong.  


My mother has been asthmatic (allergic bronchitis) for 18 years and has been on inhalers since. She is a bit allergic to a lot of stuff. I need to know if its safe to get a vaccine in such a situation. The vaccine is Astrazeneca Covishield. One of our family members goes out at most twice thrice a week for essentials so we are mostly confined to our homes for at most a month, after which my father will have to go to work and risk of covid might increase. It can also decrease because the graph seems to be plateau-ing in India, and decreasing in my city.  


I need to know if this much risk of getting covid-19 is enough that I  should get her the vaccine. I am asking this because if I miss the vaccine appointment I will not get it again for this week and not sure about if I will get it in upcoming weeks."
"Hi! Just wondering if anyone else has had these symptoms and know what it could be

Two weeks ago I got really bad palpatations/ chest pain that made me dizzy and pass out. I was unable to eat for a few days after and had the worst chest pain of my life for about a week after. Doctor tested my heart and have referred me to a cardiologist, but no one questioned my asthma?

My chest pain went away for a few days, the came back dotted around my chest. I have a rest dull ache at the bottom of my ribs in the center, it's sore to move. My upper back and neck has been really painful too.

My breathing feels really irritated, it's like someone has scratched my airways or something. I feel like I keep skipping a beat, or my diaphragm is having spasms or something and it really takes my breath away, it happens like 2-3 times a minute. I've been so wheezy the past week too, my blue inhaler works for a bit but then it goes back to wheezy.

I've been to hospital twice as I felt like I was gonna die and they told me to just wait for the cardiology referral. My temp is fine so I don't think it's am infection 

Does this sound asthma related? What helped for you?"
Alright . so i was actually prescribed breo but after reading it causes side effects im a bit concerned. i cant afford advair which was my previous inhaler . For someone like me who would be prescribed advair / breo what would be another option i can ask my doctor about ? thank you !!!!
"Hey everyone! I read your posts here everyday and I'm so grateful for this great community!

I'm writing a post because I found an app that is completely free and very helpful that helps managing asthma symptoms and identify triggers etc. It's called juli health. The reason why I want to share this is that for me it was a big game changer and many times when I read someone's post I'm like 'damn, identify your triggers'. The issue with sending a pm then is it's getting spammy or weird, and I don't want that. But I'd love for everyone to know about these opportunities.

PS. just look it up in your app store - it's 100% free, I would never recommend anything that costs money on here.

Do you have any resources like that that you want to share? I'd appreciate if they were free and easily accessible."
"So I‚Äôll start by saying this was my second week back to school and I only go in person on Thursday and Friday and I got my inhaler during quarantine so I wasn‚Äôt used to having it there yet and didn‚Äôt know about leaving an extra one with the nurse which YOULL see wouldn‚Äôt have worked anyways. I won‚Äôt say my age but I‚Äôm in a 6-12 arts school with 9 floors. I had an asthma attack from the stairs in the morning going to second period (3rd to 7th floor). My inhaler completely ran out, I went to the nurses office but ran back up because I lost my hall pass and didn‚Äôt want to risk getting in trouble. My assistant principal saw me and let me take the elevator to the nurse. The nurse was GONE, I started having a panic attack AND an asthma attack at the same time, pacing the hall. My assistant principal  came down to get me and let me sit in her office (on the 9th floor) until I could breathe. My dad brought me a new one and it‚Äôs a good thing because I had 2 or 3 more attacks that day, one of which because I had to go from the 1st to 9th floor. I‚Äôm gonna try to get an elevator pass. üòÇ"
Hi all! I‚Äôve been dealing with quite a few health issues recently and was diagnosed with asthma and a heart condition. I was told to use my inhaler whenever I felt like I needed to but to be honest I think I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out what is chest pain and what is asthma if that makes any sense. I don‚Äôt always cough but I do get a lot of tightness and difficulty breathing. This is probably a lame question and I know super subjective/personal but how do you know when to use your inhaler?
"My cortisol had flatlined after 6 months of max dose asmanex (2 puffs twice daily) 

Has this happened to anyone? What did you do?

I still have sob from long covid but my team doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reactive airways, so now they want me to wean off."
Thanks :)



"Has anyone else gotten the johnson and johnson vaccine? I got mine at 2pm Friday and I've had zero side effects (asides from the ones my brain is making up due to crippling anxiety, possibly due to singulair, who the heck knows).

I do know the risks of clots are so minute that I have a better chance of winning the mega millions lottery."
"As I'm sure many of you have seen, Singulair (montelukast) has some rather unsavory effects, which may be worse for those people who've been taking the drug since 1999 (me).

So, this begs the question, how does one stop taking singulair? I'm already on a maintenance medication (symbicort) that is basically magical, and if needed I have albuterol.

I was diagnosed with almost every single adverse effect that singulair apparently has, way back in 2006 but thought it was just like being dealt a bad hand, and this was my lot in life.

I want off this poison, but don't know how to go about it, and my asthma doctor is no longer practicing (he's like 80 at this point).


Help please!"

"So I always take singulair at 11:30 every night nonstop. But rightnow  as I‚Äôm writing this, i woke up at 3:30am and took it since I forgot. 

Will i be okay if night comes again and i take it at my usual hour? Or have i ruined everything completely? 

Thanks in advance, any opinion or advice is very much welcomed."

"I‚Äôve been using a running coach on my watch and finally, last week, I ran a mile non-stop! It was the longest I had ever run (in my entire life) without stopping due to exercise induced asthma. 

Then, guess what? This week, I did a mile and a half! I can‚Äôt believe it!"

"So I've never had anything close to asthma as a kid and I'm 21 now. I started smoking weed around age 18 and its been on and off since then. But recently, I decided I wanna get fit so I started running and I noticed I cough a lot afterwards. I don't know if it's because of the weather or just complete lack of exercise. So I wanna run consistently and see if it subsides. However, I noticed that when I laugh really hard I start coughing. This is brand new to me and I don't understand why it's happening. Is it environment factors?"
Does anyone ever get neck pain or upper back pain? My neck is sore and sometimes it will spasm. It might be from breathing so hard and I pull on my neck muscles in a weird way. Not sure though
"When I run I have wheezed pretty hard, sometimes to the point of wheeze/coughing every time I breathe. I just assume it's because I don't run often and I'm not confined enough. Also it usually goes away after a couple of hours. My worry is that if it is something that needs to be treated."
It randomly hasn't worked for 2 days and the powder inside isn't moving anymore. This deisgn is fucking retarded has this happened to anyone else? I've kept it in a draw away from anything else if that helps.
"Like when i am laughing and getting excited over something and getting worked up i start to feel breathless, it‚Äôs either normal, my anxiety or my asthma. Anyone else feel this way. I don‚Äôt get wheezy i just feel out of breath where i feel like i need to use my inhaler. I feel better after. Could also be my acid reflux i have mildly maybe causing me to feel that way"

"My asthma can go south very quickly, change in temperature is a big trigger as are allergens from grass, dust, leaves. 

A massive cold snap has arrived - temp dropped 7c in an hour, and likely to get snow overnight. I have severe asthma and have been admitted in hospital three times since April (each a 4-5 day stay), still having attacks multiple times a day and even through the night. I‚Äôm a little bit over it. I‚Äôve already had one big asthma attack tonight and really hoping to find a way to stop ending up in hospital. 

I‚Äôm looking for suggestions on what others find helpful to manage cold weather induced asthma. 

Things I do‚Ä¶

* Keep my house warm - I‚Äôve got a Dyson air purifier / heater running in the bedroom throughout the night to make sure that allergens are at bay and temp is stable. I even have a couple of bowls of water around the house too to make sure that the air doesn‚Äôt dry out too much. 

* Wear a mask, snood or merino scarf around my face if I go outdoors in the cool

* Avoid going outside as much as possible when it‚Äôs cold or when there are temp drops

* Exercise indoors

* Shiatsu and Ear Seed therapy

* Take all my meds

* Eat healthily and drink plenty of fluids

* Keep a clean home - no dander / dust mites! 


Any suggestions or ideas that might help I‚Äôd be grateful for."
I had a allergy induced asthma attack and found myself using more then the standard 2 puffs. I‚Äôm not sure how much is to much. My dr has told me not to bother them I‚Äôm working on getting a new one.
"Hey guys, so I'm 28 now and I was completely asthma free until I was 22 or 23 or so. At that time I was diagnosed with asthma due to mild symptoms..I began taking Singulair and that was the last of my symptoms

..until about 2 years ago. I missed a few days of Singulair and got a puppy. Around that time I starting having mild symptoms again. I was also training for a triathlon at the time and was doing a bit heavier cardio than normal though I always work out. My symptoms began worsening and I saw a pulmonologist who tried prescribing me maintenance inhalers  along with steroid doses as needed. Well I've continuously gotten worse or stayed the same and am at the point of having severe asthma that seems fairly unresponsive to the medicines i've tried though I will say I haven't had alot of hospital visits or anything I just generally feel bad. We gave the puppy to our mother in law and have tried many things including deep cleaning etc to no avail. So at this point I'm looking for any ideas/recommendations/anything that helped you that you may have. 

Medicines I've tried or am currently on for reference: symbicort, Singulair, advair, qvar, xolair."
"I read online that Asthma can cause GERD and gerd type symptoms and I haven‚Äôt had asthma issues since I was younger, and today I ate some greasy food and ice cream which was probably not a good idea for GERD and about an hour ago I started feeling chest tightness/ slight pain or discomfort when breathing and I took my inhaler and it seemed to help a bit but I still have a slight pain at the top of my left shoulder, like almost near the collarbone and still a bit worried

is it something serious? I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like being dizzy or anything at the moment, just this annoying chest feeling :("
"I started taking singulair daily for asthma when i was around 25 years old. i have suffered with allergies and asthma all my life, my then doc thought this would help.

my life long allergies have improved overall since then, but i attribute that more to moving, understanding my triggers more, and having 5 years of imminotherapy.

however as you might have guessed, my mental and emotional life has been on a downward tragectory from that very year i started taking singulair. i had no idea about the FDA investigation starting in 2009, nor the official warning label added to the medication in 2019 until about 3 weeks ago, and i will never take another pill.

I worry. has the damage been done?  Are there any long time takers here that have improved after stopping it? 

Thank you for reading and or replying.

I wrote to my PC Dr. this evening, and my final paragraph to her was this ""i feel there is a sword hanging over me ever since reading the official government agency warning for a medication I have taken for the last 19 years, years in which my personal happiness and functioning in life has gone from as high as i can remember it being, to a steady decline, and some sharp declines due to losses in life, but to this current point where i can do less and less. i've been losing friends, jobs, and joy in activities at a steady rate for 3 years. i'm not sure how much longer i can do this."""
"I‚Äôm asthmatic and my bf just recently diagnosed or at least had peak readings bad enough that they‚Äôve given him Relvar Ellipta. 

He felt ill yesterday, extremely nauseous and irregular heartbeat. Rang 111 (England) and the GP he spoke to didn‚Äôt seem worried and told him to keep taking it. He‚Äôs had a bad headache all day today and slept a lot this evening and went to bed early too. It‚Äôs got me looking at the side effects of the medicine and I‚Äôm honestly just floored. What the hell is this??  

It can give more than one in 10 people the common cold?? How does that happen?

Up to 1 in 10 can have bronchitis, throat infections, FLU?! Weakening of the bones?!? 

Up to 1 in 100 with regular heartbeat and hyperglycaemia ?!

He‚Äôs literally got a chronic cough, how is trading a cough for weak bones and irregular heartrate anywhere near an appropriate risk vs benefit analysis?? 

I‚Äôm thoroughly floored by this information???"
im just getting back from the doctors and they prescribed me dulera for 2 puffs in the morning and at night and also as a rescue inhaler. how big is it and how does it affect you?? i dont exactly know what it would do because i havent had a steroid inhaler before and idk about any reactions you could have

So I am 16 and recently had my first asthma attack. I've been taking antihistamines but a big concern is that I'm a very avid marijuana user and every time I take a hit off of my weed pen I go into full panic mode and have a asthma attack . Will I ever be able to smoke again?
"My Dr recently prescribed me the RespiClick inhaler. Sense it is like the maintenance inhalers as its a powder, is it possible you get less of the medicine than the Aerosol inhalers? I can't tell if it is working the same better or worse.

Which do you guys prefer?"
"Hi guys

So I recently applied for the Australian Defence Force and I got a call about my medical history. They asked about my medical history and I told them that I had asthma as a child, haven't been on a preventer since high school (16, I'm 25 now), and only use an inhaler when I really have to. I'm an active weightlifter and haven't suffered any asthma attacks since maybe I was 4 years old.

I just want to enquire if there are any asthma or lung tests you can do yourself or with a GP so understand more about your asthma. The idea is I can get rejected because I have asthma but if I have mild control asthma, I may pass depending on my role. I just want to see where I am currently 

I am from Sydney AUS but haven't seen a medical professional since my orthodontist when I was 14 so not sure if any places do asthma/lung tests.

Thanks"
"I've been an asthma patient for almost about 9 years now and I'm using Cipla Seroflo 250 mg since then (it was prescribed by my doc). I use that inhaler only when asthma triggers. I'm getting very frequent attacks lately and I'm worried if using this daily is even safe? I feel very tired, sleepy, lethargic and annoyed whole day when I use my inhaler."
"22 / f (smoker/vape)

I was taking a pretty strong shot and couldn't breathe for a few seconds and when I finally was able to breathe I started wheezing and it continued for like 5 minutes while my boyfriend was panicking and I couldn't explain what was happening. Now my throat is full of mucus and my throat is sore.

Is it common to have asthma attacks triggered by intense alcohol or was this just a weird coincidence?"
"I have panic disorder/ ocd, asthma and seasonal allergies. Recently, when I speak on the phone or if I‚Äôm in a somewhat heated conversation I get air hunger. I‚Äôm not short of breath or have any other symptoms other than the constant urge to take deep (satisfying) breathes. I‚Äôve tried my albuterol before getting on calls, during etc and I don‚Äôt think it really has done anything. I would chalk it up to anxiety but sometimes the feeling will linger for a few days even if I‚Äôm not on calls. 
Anyone know what this could be?
I have a dr app this week. Just curious if anyone has similar experiences. 
Thanks"
"Should I carry my inhaler with me?  I used to be able to just use it and itd be fine for hours but now I'm not sure if it works for 15 seconds(my asthma is bad enough that I can literally stand still and breath and that makes me start coughing)


But yea I'm asking cause I was super active before my asthma got really bad"
"Did anyone else take 500ug daily of fluticasone when they were in their teenage years? I'm worried about the side effects this might have had and can't find anyone with a similar situation.

If not does anyone know if this is especially bad for growth or development?

Any help is much appreciated"
"Under my chin (the soft spot) like at the bottom of your mouth under your tongue not sure if it‚Äôs the nerve endings or what but it feels really ticklish and it‚Äôs annoying me, i can feel it more breathing in and sometimes when i breath in the ticklish feeling can make me cough. I was prodding that area other week when i got cramp under my chin and the muscles got all sore afterwards, not sure if i upset something prodding or what. It could be just me overthinking and it being nothing but my health anxiety doesn‚Äôt help!. I know our bodies can be wired at times but the ticklish feeling is annoying me."
"So I've had asthma for as long as i can remember. The farthest memory being when i was 4-5 years. I have always used an inhaler (salbutamol/Ventolin). It was bad like no sports getting inhaler puffs almost every hour. Then i gained weight from age 16 to 22 which made it worse. After a few visits to doctors i was prescribed to singulair 10 mg. One pill at night. All my symptoms gone. Then i got off it and it came back. Since 4 years ago I've been taking montelukast 1 pill at night. If i go off it for 3 days i get back to square one.

  


Now there has been side effects. Nightmares/bad dreams which is actually not too bad i still sleep like a baby. Mood swings and a little depression but i think its mostly adult life and traumas. My question is that is it bad if i take this pill for lets say till i die. Or would it screw my liver up and my organs. Because mental side effects have been manageable till now. And this pill is amazing for me."
My legs and and hands/arms feel really jittery. Not sure if it‚Äôs my anxiety kicking in or my inhaler making me feel that way.
"Not sure if inhalers can cause it, past 3 days i have this little tickle, not sure if it‚Äôs my nerve endings or what or maybe over using my inhaler or something. Breathing kinda makes me feel the tickle more."
"I just moved so far my asthma has been perfect in my new apartment however at my parents house we got a puppy and i brought my cat cause im staying with them till i am vaccinated , since i got the two pets plus the change of weather i wheeze and cough a lot !! anyone else experiencing this now that its spring ??"
"Hi all,

I've been taking Symbicort twice a day for over a year to control my asthma now. 31 male for reference.

I have been told by the NHS Vaccine service that I am eligible for a vaccine (apparently being on the brown inhaler alone qualifies you), but my doctor refuses to say that I'm eligible for the vaccine after ""reviewing my case"". 

Who should I be believing here? I'm a teacher and regularly see 1500+ people a day to add to that. 

Has anyone been deemed eligible and gotten their vaccine based on their asthma? Is there anything you can suggest I do to get a vaccine? I just want to feel safer at work.

Thanks all."
"So I'm a newly diagnosed asthma person. I'm grateful my symptoms are more unpleasant (persistent, non stop cough) than fatal, but I'm still thrilled that there is medicine that can help me. But navigating my insurance situation... It's got me to the point where today I went back and forth between screaming bloody murder and just curling up in a ball and crying. I feel so utterly helpless in this terrible, broken healthcare system in the USA.

First, their formulary didn't cover the drugs I was originally prescribed. That was frustrating, but at least there was a solution. Now I'm on drugs that are covered. The free samples have helped me so much, but I'm struggling to get the prescription filled.

I have Cigna which requires me to use the express scripts mail order pharmacy. Well I'm almost out of my sample meds and still haven't gotten the delivery. Also there's no tracking status on the package for nearly a week, no one knows where it is. I fought with the insurance today, because omg I'm feeling so much better with these samples I just want my meds. They gave me an exception for a 30 day supply via Walgreens. Which cost 3x as much as a mail order 90 day supply.

I just don't know what to do. I feel so totally helpless here. I have a good paying job but I don't want to be spending hundreds of dollars every month on my medication. This is just utterly horrifying. I'm going to keep trying to make the mail order work, hopefully that 90 day supply will show up within the next week. This is just such a hot mess.

I'm ranging between wanting to curl up in a ball and cry one moment and find some way to hurt these fuckers the next. It's so ridiculous and unfair.

I don't know what to do."

"For a few days, I noticed I had a hard time breathing but I thought nothing of it. Earlier today I horrible feeling and fell in my apartment and I was rushed to the E.R. I was nervous that I might of gotten perhaps Covid and my wife was panicking as well.

Well.... the good news is that I do not have Covid (I'm negative) but the bad news is I had a full-blown asthma attack. And I was diagnosed with asthma in my 30s.

How could this be? I never had any breathing issues in my life. My family doesn't have a history of asthma. Yes, I was a smoker in my early 20s and quite all together in my mid-20s and never smoked since. And yet, I have asthma now. My wife, coincidently, has asthma as well (but I doubt that I 'caught it from her' it's obviously impossible).

As I'm writing this, I'm hooked to oxygen and I ask in all seriousness, how is it possible to been have asthma in my 30s? I thought it was genetic or you have signs from it when you're a kid/

Is it rare to be diagnosed with asthma 30 years into your life?"
"So basically today, in the middle of class right, my teacher randomly busted out coughing, and her face was red, I thought she was choking, but then I remembered her telling me she had asthma, so that's why she had a reaction. She took her inhaler, I'm pretty sure she's fine now, hopefully, you guys don't experience anything like that. Have a good day."
"I probably sound stupid... But, I've been on the prevention inhaler for a while and it isn't doing anything, so the nurse told me to up my dosage from 1 puff to 2 puffs. I said sure and went home. But now I wish I had asked her how I'm supposed to do that because I'm struggling to understand. Do I press the inhaler once, breathe it in, then press it again and do the breathing in again. Or do I press it twice in one go and breathe in the whole 2 presses at once? I'm using a spacer by the way. Please help (‡πë‚Ä¢Ôπè‚Ä¢)"
"My wife has severe asthma (5 intubations in last 2 years), and yesterday she had the first of three BT procedures - they did her right side lower lobe. Her interventional pulmonologist told us prior to the procedure that she would be staying over at least one night for observation. 

She was breathing pretty well (for her) last night and this morning, but slowly getting worse during the day. 

The resident was in the room checking on her and her lungs turned to cement (her term for extremely hard to breathe) and the Code Blue was called. It is amazing how many people show up when they hear that page go out. 

I am in the waiting room while she is getting settled in the ICU. 

So this makes intubation #6."
Does anybody know why this happens to me. I used to have bad asthma at a younger age but my problems randomly stopped and now this occurs.
I took my rescue inhaler idk if it‚Äôs allergies but my chest feels a little restricted I feel like it‚Äôs my posture but little short of breath and coughing . Does anyone get this with allergies or triggers asthma ?

Can acid reflux or anxiety make you feel you need to use your inhaler more? when i do use it i feel relieved though. I aren‚Äôt wheezing but just feel a little breathless. Taking it helps me. Is that normal? Can you need your inhaler even without wheezing. I take it a couple of times in a day my blue inhaler to relieve symptoms.
"Hey my doctor recommended me to try Breo Ellipta as he said it's a more modern effect form of asthma medication then what I was taking. He did warn me that it may cause me to have a saw throat but said try it and see how it goes. I had my first dose yesterday morning (36 hours ago). By that arvo I started to get a light saw throat. 12 hours later right before bed I started to get a cold. I woke up fairly sick (in terms of a cold) with a really bad sore throat, head ache shivers, stotty nose and sneezing which got a bit worse through out the day. I was wondering if this was coincidence or was it the Breo Ellipta. I didn't take it again today and probably will go back to my old puffer. Any similar experiences?"

Nothings better than a new inhaler
"Hello can someone help me please, I cannot breathe I'm trying with both and my nose and mouth at the same time but barely any oxygen is getting through my lungs.

When I was young I had allergic asthma but I haven't used or had a attack over 8 years. For the last two years I've been smoking cigarretes but I haven't had a attack or felt bad at all I know it is a filthy habit to have but do you guys have any idea if it is going to trigger it or not?
"I'm 25 years old, male and have mild asthma that's controlled. It's never posed much of an issue to me except for using an inhaler sometimes after hard exercise, laughing a lot, breathing something in funny, etc. One thing that's been constant in my life though is I always get really bad colds when I get the common cold. I'll get really congested, feel weak and spend a whole day throwing up either phlegm or bile. Since those liquids keep building up in my stomach, I'll also throw up any liquids I drink. I get dehydrated, super thirsty and just feel horrible all day long. This has happened to me once to twice a year from childhood to 2018. In 2018 I started drinking orange juice and running regularly, this is my first time getting sick in 3 years.

Yesterday was one of those horrible days. I feel much better now but throwing up all day was miserable. The reason I'm posting this is because my 61 year old mother started symptoms the same day I did on Friday. She's a chronic smoker and has smokers cough. Despite her age and the smoking, she just had the sniffles the past few days and looked much better than I did. While I don't wish anything bad on my mother, I'm baffled I fared so much worse than she did given my age, taking in Vitamin C every day and regular exercise. All signs of a better immune system. 

My question is does anybody get severe colds like this? I thought I read somewhere that asthmatics tend to get worse colds due to some sort of fluid build up and that makes sense since I'll throw up either phlegm or bile. However I've tried googling and can't find anything saying this. My brother also has asthma, a little worse than my own but his colds are minor in contrast. He won't throw up at all."
"My primary care doc has me on asmanex, then breztri, but my asthma has been getting worse over time and I really need to see a different doc.  But I'd like to go into it with a basic understanding of comparison of the meds that are available and what's in them, if possible."
"Hello everyone, 

I have refractory allergic asthma, and for the past few months, more than the usual, I have this sharp and intense pain in my chest when I breathe in and out, as if my whole respiratory tract is burning. It's really painful and annoying, and on top of it, I cough when breath. 
The pain subsided while I took oral steroids, but aftwr I stopped, the pain came back even more intense. 
I also had last week my 1st dose of Fasenra, but I guess it's too eay to tell if it's going to work.

I know that the allergy season just started and that this pain is somewhat normal, but I would really need and appreciate any advice you may have about how to cope with this, if there are any home remedies that you tried and worked. Anything, really.

I feel at a loss, and I have issues concentrating to anything but this pain.

Be well, everyone ~~"
"I've talked about this with three doctors, and all of them have said the same thing - it's usually that sneezing is the effect and not the trigger itself. They've said that maybe what is triggering the sneeze is also triggering asthma.

But I am not convinced. Everytime I sneeze, it's followed promptly by a flare up. This happens 100% of the time. 

However, when feel the sneeze coming, if I manage avoid actually sneezing, usually by taking a sip of water, there's no sneeze and there's no flare up. This is also true 100% of the time I avoid sneezing. 

Am I missing something? Has anyone else had a similar experience?"
Anyone else take fluticasone-fluorate/vilanterol inhaler what's it like ? Thanks
"I have asthma and a kitten. I‚Äôm learning quickly that the two don‚Äôt mix well at all. It seems that the dander triggers my asthma pretty badly, to the point where I‚Äôm using my inhaler multiple times a day. Re-homing the cat is out of the question. Does anyone have any tips to keep my lung damage to a minimum?"

"Crazy thought over here, my asthma became severe after getting horribly sick at the beginning of 2020. I got fully vaccinated at the end of March. Within the last month, my need for a rescue inhaler has gone down drastically. I used to use it numerous times a month, but I‚Äôve only had to use it when my allergies (and pollen count is very high right now and I‚Äôm very allergic to oak trees) got bad, three times within the last week and a half because my mother cut the grass (I‚Äôm very allergic) and twice in the entirety of April. *In the entirety of April.*

This is a massive improvement from the last year of suffering I‚Äôve had after my severe asthma diagnosis. I‚Äôm right smack in the middle of allergy season, all my allergens are in full swing, and I‚Äôve only had to use my rescue inhaler when my mother‚Äôs cut the lawn and the pollen count was in the severe range. Literally nothing in my life (or medication routine) has changed except being fully vaccinated.

Do you think it would be worth it to ask for another PFT to see what my lung capacity is and if it‚Äôs changed at all since last year when I last got one? Is there a possibility that the vaccine drastically reduced lung inflammation? I was never confirmed to have covid at the beginning of 2020 as they wouldn‚Äôt test me because I hadn‚Äôt been out of the country within the past two weeks for being sick, so I can‚Äôt say for certain if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on."
"To me this a serious question. I haven‚Äôt smoked weed in years and I plan on continuing that way. However I would like to hear the full and honest opinion about the safety of edibles for us. Would it exacerbate our symptoms? Or can you just relax and unwind for a day?

Thanks in advance."
So I have severe asthma and am considering doing this. I know it's not fully researched and such yet I've heard a range of results from this. Has anyone here tried it? What results did you see? Anything else relevant is also appreciated.
"My asthma is allergy and exercise induced (when i am unfit). I discovered I had it when I moved to a place that had frequent bushfires and would also sort of collect smoke from neighboring states when the winds picked up.

Mine is called silent asthma because there is no wheeze and I feel chest pains, muscle aches and lightheaded before I tealise my lungs are in distress. Because it gives me palpitations, hives, body swelling including eyelids and throat, arthiritic pain, migraines, poor coordination, extreme fatigue and gerd-
my doctor thinks I may have also developed an allergy to smoke. So I have been referred to an allergy specialist. My asthma is only controlled if I stay in doors. I learned this the hard way by braving the trains to go to work on a smokey day with a dust mask on. The flare up was so bad, I am still recovering. 

The reason for my question is I would like to know if anyone else in the sub has anything like this. How you exercise when you have symptoms? If stronger medication allowed you to go outside like everyone else even when there was poor air quality? Or did you have to eventually move because of the lowered quality of life. I love the outdoors and really hate being unable to even sit in the backyard.

"So I have relatively newly diagnosed eosinophilic asthma and my doctor is trying to get me on a shot to lower the number of eosinophils in my blood, however, my insurance keeps denying saying ""there's not enough proof that I have asthma"" and ""try daily inhaler/rescue inhaler/steroids."" 

1. The number one test for eosinophilic asthma is the blood test. Which was provided multiple times, always over their threshold for diagnosis. 

2. We've tried them all. Im using a rescue inhaler at least once a day on top fo my wixela 2x daily. And I had an asthma attack bad enough to land me in the er where they gave me a breathing treatment and iv steroids, then a prescription for 50mg prednisone for the following week. Within 30 minutes of starting the iv steroids, my blood pressure spiked dangerously high (210/130) but I could breath. The effect was almost immediate. They'd taken my blood at that visit, and as expected, my eosinophils were astronomically high. The next week I had an appointment with my hematologist and prior to the appointment, she had a blood test run, my eosinophils were at 0. It felt like I didn't have asthma, I felt normal (except the blood pressure, and the fact that high doses of prednisone nearly immediately causes fluid to accumulate in my belly which hurts.)  Within a week of that appointment, I'd been off the prednisone for a week and scheduled an appointment to see my regular doctor about my blood pressure that had still refused to go down and was sent *back* to the er where they couldn't get my blood pressure under control with 3 different medications. They took my blood then and my eosinophils were already at the very upper limit of normal. It took close to a month of treatment before my blood pressure was normal again and stopping it means a spike. So even though it works, I can't take prednisone again without a substantial risk to my health. It's not worth damaging one part of my body to fix another. 

I've already had another appointment with my hematologist and my eosinophils are back to pre prednisone levels and I'm having daily asthma attacks, some that come right back within 2 minutes of using my rescue inhaler. My chest hurts so bad during and after the asthma attacks and I'm sick of it. Does anyone have any tips on fighting my insurance on this? I have 0 chance of affording ANY of the medicines without insurance coverage but I honestly feel like I'm going to die if this keeps up. I'm waking up to asthma attacks some days, one day I'm just not going to wake up!"
Usually my asthma doesn‚Äôt flare up at night but tonight I find it hard to take a full deep breath and chest a little tight .
I have never felt like this.  I live in long island and i can't breathe for an entire week now.  I just got tested yesterday and Its negative.  Thank GOD My lungs feel closed.  Is anyone out there in the same boat?
I had to use my inhaler and had a brainfart moment where I swallowed some of the air in my inhaler. Has that happened to anyone else? Anything to be concerned about? I have the taste of the air in my mouth but I feel fine.
"Anyone else have an advair or wixela inhub inhailer and find it works better to calm reactions then the rescue inhaler?   


I get most of my reactions in my neck."
I‚Äôm new to this inhaler thing. I‚Äôm guessing it would be ok to take Benadryl antihistamines and my ventolin inhaler within an hour of each other won‚Äôt it ?

"I used a DPI with a 200mg capsule of my preventative medicine. 5 minutes afterwards I felt very sharp pain in my chest, kind of like a cramp, and I had to lie down for it to get better. 

Maybe I didn‚Äôt use the inhaler correctly? Because I forgot to hold my breath afterwards and I also had to do it twice to get all the medicine out. Is it normal? 

I‚Äôm 21, and underweight if that has any relevance to this."
"I am planning to get vaccinated soon (just waiting on my call), so this question isn't about if the vaccine is safe for those with asthma. My question is about if we are still at greater risk of contracting covid and/or more severe symptoms due to having asthma after being fully vaccinated."
"That was what a pulmonologist told me yesterday. When I was looking for appointments with a pulmonologist in January, most had appointments in August or even November, this one was the only one with appointments before August, and I can see why. 

I went to get treatment for my asthma and she couldn't believe I didn't have treatment and wasn't dead. I said it was never severe asthma and that I did get treatment for some time, I just hadn't had treatment for a few years and that salbutamol gave me tachycardia. She wouldn't let that go, she kept saying that it could not be asthma if I didn't have a treatment. Later I said I needed some proof of my asthma so that my doctor would sign me up for the vaccine as a risk group and first she said that that was only for severe asthma. Then she said that you can't really diagnose asthma?? But that if I had relatives with asthma it was most likely that I had it too and I was like yes, I do have it, I was actually diagnosed after getting exams done. She even had a spirometry exam in front of her and she said that yeah, it wasn't good and it could suggest asthma, but that there was no way to diagnose it for sure. So I would understand needing more exams, but saying that there is NO WAY to diagnose it?? And lastly she said that she didn't agree with asthma patients being regarded as risk groups for COVID because it wasn't actually a risk factor. 

She would not stop talking even if I tried interrupting her. I tried asking that how could a respiratory disease not be a risk factor for another respiratory disease?? But she just went on and on. I can't believe I heard all of this from an actual specialist. At least she gave me meds and a paper to sign up for the vaccine. I don't know if I should trust this doctor? But I won't get appointments somewhere else until the end of the year so I guess for now I am stuck with her.

I wonder though, is it an actual thing? Not believing that asthma is a risk factor for COVID? Or should I really get an appointment somewhere else ASAP?"
